"NEW YORK (Reuters) - European stocks closed lower on Tuesday, the first trading day of 2018, while Wall Street advanced and the U.S. dollar fell to its weakest in over three months against key currencies.
A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS gained 0.61 percent. The index had set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value in 2017.
Major stock indexes closed 2017 with their best performance since 2013. In the U.S. market, the advance came amid strong economic growth and corporate earnings, low interest rates and hopes, now realized, of U.S. corporate tax cuts.
U.S. equity indexes advanced on Tuesday, buoyed by gains in technology and consumer discretionary stocks.
Increases in Apple ( AAPL.O ), Facebook ( FB.O ), Alphabet ( GOOGL.O ) and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) shares pulled the S&P 500 index higher on Tuesday.
“People are back to looking at what have been the winners. It has been very momentum driven,” said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 59.79 points, or 0.24 percent, to 24,779.01, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 17.15 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,690.76 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 91.91 points, or 1.33 percent, to 6,995.30.
In Europe, equities closed lower after autos stocks fell following weaker car registrations data. Trading was also cautious ahead of the launch of a major reform of European financial markets.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.21 percent along with euro zone stocks .STOXXE, down 0.19 percent.
Shares rose in Asia. Shanghai blue chips .CSI300 climbed 1.41 percent and MSCI's 24-country emerging market stock index .MSCIEF jumped to a multi-year high after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline.
FALLING DOLLAR The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.23 percent. It was hampered by market expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture.
The dollar had already hit a three-month low .DXY on Friday, bringing its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worst performance since 2003.
Other currencies gained. The euro EUR= rose 0.3 percent to $1.2044 and hit a four-month high on Tuesday after data showed that euro zone manufacturers ramped up activity last month at the fastest pace in more than two decades.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.28 percent at 112.35 per dollar, while sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3594, up 0.69 percent on the day.
U.S. Treasury yields rose in line with European government yields. A European Central Bank official said the bank’s massive bond purchase program might not continue later this year.
A reversal of year-end buying has also driven U.S. Treasury yields higher, said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.
“Lots of institutions buy Treasuries to hold over year-end for liquidity. To see that reversal early in the year is not a surprise,” Rehling said.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 16/32 in price to yield 2.4687 percent, from 2.411 percent late on Friday.
The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 45/32 in price to yield 2.8105 percent, from 2.741 percent late on Friday.
U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.13 percent to $60.34 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was at $66.52, down 0.52 percent. Oil prices earlier had enjoyed their strongest start to a year since 2014 amid large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.
Copper CMCU3 lost 0.42 percent to $7,216.50 a tonne, but that follows a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top.
Spot gold XAU= added 1.0 percent to $1,315.15 an ounce, after advancing by 13 percent in 2017 for its best performance in seven years.

"Fears of a government shutdown coursed through Washington, D.C., on Thursday, as House and Senate leaders negotiated a spending bill and federal agencies prepared to furlough workers. But if you watched President Donald Trump touting his recently passed tax cuts outside Pittsburgh, Pa., you might never have known it.
Over the course of a 20-minute speech at a heavy-equipment manufacturing plant, Trump, who read from a teleprompter, didn't mention the looming closure of government once. ""Who knows?"" Before the speech, Trump said, ""Who knows?"" when reporters asked if he thought the federal government would be forced to close.
The president has consistently claimed that Democrats in Congress actually want a government shutdown, in order to detract attention away from the recently enacted Republican tax cuts.
Democrats are insisting that DACA protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children be extended as part of any longer-term spending bill. Both Trump and Republican leaders have previously said they would support a fix to keep the 800,000 immigrants from being at risk of deportation.
Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks during a tour of the H&K Equipment Company in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania on January 18, 2018. But last week, Trump rejected a bipartisan Senate group's immigration deal that lawmakers said would have enshrined DACA protections and would have met Trump's demands, which included funding for a barrier on the Southern border, and changes to extended family migration and the visa ""lottery.""
Ever since then, the White House has put out mixed messages about what Trump wants, sowing confusion in Congress and angering lawmakers in both parties.
""I'm looking for something that President Trump supports,"" Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday, ""and he's not yet indicated what measure he's willing to sign.""
A government shutdown would mean hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be forced to go without pay, and important public services would be suspended. Lawmakers are desperate to avoid this scenario, as well as the resulting public backlash.
But judging from the president's twitter account – an often instantaneous reflection of what Trump is thinking about – Trump isn't nearly as desperate. Only three of the 36 tweets from Trump's account this week mentioned the word ""shutdown,"" and two sought to blame Democrats. One of them, on Thursday, made a shutdown sound all but inevitable.
Trump tweet
Complicating matters for Republicans is Trump's well documented willingness to blame members of his own party when it is politically expedient for him to do so.
During last year's failed repeal of Obamacare, Trump refused to take responsibility for the legislative breakdown, blaming GOP lawmakers instead.
""I'm not going to blame myself. I'll be honest, they are not getting the job done,"" Trump told reporters at a Cabinet meeting in October, adding that some Republicans, ""should be ashamed of themselves.""
Already on Thursday, the White House appeared to be downplaying the impact of a possible shutdown, while at the same time preparing to lay blame on Congress if the government shuts down. ""We're all focused myopically on what is happening today and whether the government will shut down,"" While House legislative director Marc Short told Politico. ""What's missing from this conversation is the complete dysfunction ofd Congress, and its inability to complete the appropriations process.""
As if on cue, less than an hour before a scheduled House vote on a spending bill Thursday night, Trump tweeted at lawmakers. ""Our military needs it!"" he wrote.
TRUMP tweet
Trump, meanwhile, is scheduled to leave Washington on Friday afternoon for his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he will mark the one-year anniversary of his inauguration by holding a fundraiser. A White House spokesman would not not say on Friday whether he plans to change his travel plans if Congress doesn't reach a deal.

" 03 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago Actor Casey Affleck withdraws as 2018 Oscar presenter Dan Whitcomb 3 Min Read 
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Oscar-winning Casey Affleck, who has been accused   by female crew members on earlier films, has withdrawn as a presenter at the 2018 Academy Awards, a spokeswoman for the organization said on Thursday. 
Affleck, 42, who won the best actor Oscar last year for his performance in the family drama “Manchester by the Sea,” was expected to present this year’s best actress award in keeping with Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences tradition. 
“We appreciate the decision to keep the focus on the show and on the great work of this year.” the academy spokeswoman said. 
A publicist for Affleck, Mara Buxbaum, confirmed that Affleck would not be attending this year’s ceremony, which is scheduled for March 4 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, but declined further comment. 
Affleck, the younger brother of actor and director Ben Affleck, topped challenges from Denzel Washington and Ryan Gosling to win the 2017 award. He also took home a Golden Globe and numerous trophies from film critics groups. 
The win came despite 2010 sexual harassment accusations that resurfaced in the run-up to the ceremony. Two lawsuits alleging unwanted advances were filed by female crew members on another movie and were settled out of court for undisclosed sums. 
An attorney for Affleck denied the accusations at the time. 
Affleck adopts a lower public profile than his brother Ben and appears uncomfortable in the spotlight. He was first nominated for an Oscar in 2008 for his lead role in “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.” 
While Ben Affleck has opted for big movies like “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” Casey Affleck has focused his career on smaller, independent ventures with strong character-driven plots such as “Gone Baby Gone.” 
In 2010, he wrote and directed Joaquin Phoenix in “I‘m Still Here,” a mockumentary about Phoenix’s supposed transition from acting to becoming a rap musician. 
Two years ago he quietly separated from his wife, actress Summer Phoenix, after a nine-year marriage that produced two sons.

"January 22, 2018 / 7:23 PM / Updated 2 hours ago EU mulls new link between budget and civic rights Reuters Staff 3 Min Read 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU’s justice commissioner is working on a proposal that could oblige member states such as Poland, which has clashed with Brussels over reforms to its courts, to pass tests on the independence of their judicial systems before receiving funding. 
Vera Jourova said there was agreement within the executive European Commission to work on ideas to encourage strong judiciaries in planning for the new budget from 2021. 
“One way could be to insist that independent justice systems are necessary for effective control of the use of EU funds,” she said. “I would like to propose that link.” 
A Commission spokesman said on Monday the work by Jourova was part of broader preparations for a new, seven-year EU budget plan, due to be published in May, and was in line with policy outlines the EU executive has put forward since last year. 
The remarks by Jourova, the Commission’s Czech member, come as the EU executive is challenging Poland, a major recipient of Union funds, to amend judicial reforms which Brussels says will hurt democracy and its oversight of EU trading rules. 
Facing the prospect of filling a hole left in the budget by Britain’s exit from the EU, and irritated by Poland and other governments in the ex-communist east on a range of issues, some wealthy Western governments have pushed for a clearer link between getting subsidies and abiding by EU standards. 
The German commissioner in charge of the budget, Guenther Oettinger, warned Poland this month that it could lose some of its 7 billion euros annual funding if it fails to heed Brussels’ complaints about undermining the rule of law. 
More broadly, Jourova is also hoping for a review of EU policy on judicial standards in the second half of this year. EU officials say that might, for example, include regular reviews of the performance of national justice systems, along the lines of existing biennial reviews of government economic policies, which are meant to promote “convergence” toward EU-wide goals. 
As a former national official handling the regional funding that is a key part of EU efforts to bring poor regions closer to the prosperity of others, Jourova stressed that she saw any new rules applying to all EU funding for all states, not just to so-called “cohesion” policy. She also said it should not be seen as a punitive measure but designed to encourage good practice. 
She also said discussion on the proposals could be used to help simplify some of the hurdles to applying for EU funds. 
Any Commission proposal seen as too radical by governments risk being killed off by member states. Reporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Catherine Evans","The EU's justice commissioner, Vera Jourova, is proposing a link between judicial independence and EU funding, particularly affecting member states like Poland, which receives approximately €7 billion annually. This initiative is part of preparations for a new seven-year EU budget plan set to be published in May 2021. Jourova aims to ensure that independent justice systems are a prerequisite for effective EU fund management. The proposal aligns with ongoing EU efforts to address judicial reforms in Poland, which Brussels argues undermine democracy. Additionally, Jourova seeks a review of EU judicial standards, potentially including regular assessments of national justice systems, to promote adherence to EU norms."

"HOUSTON, Jan. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spark Energy, Inc. (""Spark"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:SPKE), an independent retail energy services company, announced today that the Company and Verde Energy USA Holdings, LLC (“Verde”) have agreed to terminate the earnout provisions of the purchase and sale transaction in which Spark acquired Verde’s operating subsidiaries in July 2017. Pursuant to the Membership Interest and Stock Purchase Agreement (“MIPA”) entered into between the Company, its subsidiary, and Verde on May 5, 2017, the Company was obligated to pay 100% of the Adjusted EBITDA earned by the Verde Companies for the 18 months following closing that exceeds certain thresholds, subject to the Verde Companies’ ability to achieve defined customer count criteria. In connection with such obligations, Verde’s existing management continued to operate the business as a separate entity during the earnout period. The buyout transaction provides for a lump sum payment of approximately $6.0 million in June 2019 in substitution of the existing earnout obligations. With the buyout of the earnout provision, Spark management will assume complete control over Verde’s operations, effective immediately. “The early buyout of the Verde earnout gives us the opportunity to begin immediate improvement in our bottom line results,” said Nathan Kroeker, Spark Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “As I mentioned on our last earnings call, one of our near-term strategic priorities is to maximize process efficiencies and synergies through the integration of recent acquisitions. By ending the Verde earnout almost a year early, we are able to accelerate and realize synergies of the acquisition that should increase our Adjusted EBITDA performance in future periods.” About Spark Energy, Inc.

"It’s the end of the world as we know it--or so we’re told, not just by R.E.M., but also this week by the venerable Economist , which carries a lengthy special report pondering “The Next War.” The issue’s lead essay warns that “powerful, long-term shifts in geopolitics and the proliferation of new technologies” are eroding America’s global dominance, obliging thinking people everywhere to think about the unthinkable. “Conflict on a scale and intensity not seen since the second world war is once again plausible,” the essay intones. “The world is not prepared.” The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists , too, is sounding the alarm . On Thursday, the group moved the “ Doomsday Clock ,” its symbolic predictor of the likelihood of nuclear apocalypse, to “2 minutes to midnight.” The new setting is 30 seconds closer to catastrophe than last year, signaling that the world is as close to nuclear disaster, in the group’s assessment, as it has ever been. The Economist, in highlighting higher risk of global conflict, cites the Pentagon’s new national defense strategy , which identifies “great power competition” between the US, China and Russia as the “central challenge to US prosperity and security.” The report deems China and Russia greater threats to US security than jihadism. ( Fortune flagged that report for CEO Daily readers last week.)","The Economist's special report warns of potential global conflict, citing shifts in geopolitics and technology eroding U.S. dominance. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists moved the Doomsday Clock to 2 minutes to midnight, 30 seconds closer to nuclear disaster than last year. The Pentagon identifies U.S., China, and Russia competition as the central security challenge."
"The Economist cites North Korea as the world’s most immediate security flashpoint. But it twits US president Donald Trump’s refusal to uphold America’s traditional role as world leader as the main long-run threat to global stability. “Mr Trump says he wants to make America great again, but is going about it in exactly the wrong way,” Economist editors opine. “He shuns multilateral organizations, treats alliances as unwanted baggage and openly admires the authoritarian leaders of America's adversaries. It is as if Mr Trump wants America to give up defending the system it created and to join Russia and China as just another truculent revisionist power instead.” Strong stuff. Officials from the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists also decry American abdication of global leadership under Trump as a key source of global instability. Trump’s decision this week to impose steep tariffs on imports of washing machines and solar panels did little to allay such concerns. A host of publications, including the BBC and Bloomberg , warned that, should push come to shove, China has many options for retaliation in a trade war. Former Morgan Stanley economist Stephen Roach, in an essay entitled “How to Lose a Trade War,” decried Trump’s trade policies as “backward looking at best” and putting growth of the US economy at risk.","The Economist labels North Korea as the top security threat, while criticizing Donald Trump's approach to global leadership as detrimental. Trump's recent tariffs on washing machines and solar panels raise concerns, with experts warning of China's potential retaliation. Stephen Roach calls Trump's trade policies ""backward looking,"" jeopardizing US economic growth."
"Trump himself seems unfazed by such concerns. In his speech to the World Economic Forum at Davos, to which he is the first US president to attend since Bill Clinton in 2000, the US leader declared that America’s economy is “ roaring back ” and “open for business.”

"January 15, 2018 / 12:41 AM / Updated an hour ago Oil hovers near three-year high despite rising U.S. output Nia Williams , Rod Nickel 3 Min Read 
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Oil hovered near a three-year high above $70 a barrel on Monday on signs that production cuts by OPEC and Russia are tightening supplies, although analysts warned of a “red flag” due to surging U.S. production.

International benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 last traded 29 cents higher at $70.16 by 1937 GMT, having risen to a high of $70.37 a barrel earlier in the session. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 gained 51 cents at $64.81 a barrel. Both benchmarks hit levels not seen since December 2014, although trading was thin due to a holiday in the United States. 
A production-cutting pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers has given a strong tailwind to oil prices. 
Growing signs of a tightening market after a three-year rout have bolstered confidence among traders and analysts. 
“It’s catching a lot of people by surprise and I think (prices) are sustainable,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. “We’re seeing the reality of strong demand and declining supplies.” 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Monday raised its 2018 Brent price forecast to $64 a barrel from $56, forecasting a deficit of 430,000 barrels per day (bpd) in oil production compared to demand this year. 
“OPEC and non-OPEC producers remain committed to production cuts at the same time world oil demand continues to increase,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. 
“As we go through 2018, the market is also going to continue to look at geopolitical supply disruptions that could occur in Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela.” RED FLAG 
Still, some analysts have warned that the 13 percent rally since the start of the year could peter out due to global refinery maintenance and rising North American production. 
U.S. energy companies added 10 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 12, taking the number to 752, energy service firm Baker Hughes ( GE.N ) said on Friday. 
That was the biggest increase since June 2017. 
In Canada, energy firms almost doubled the number of rigs drilling for oil last week to 185, the highest level in 10 months. 
Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy expects U.S. production to grow by 600,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a year earlier. 
“From a fundamental perspective, the surge in U.S. managed money raises a clear red flag for us. We see the U.S. complex as decidedly bearish over the next two months.” 
But Flynn said a fast climb in U.S. output is not so clear. 
“The realities of the shale market are starting to sink in. Shale producers have to add a lot of rigs, frack crews and add a lot of investment. It takes time to raise that production.”   Ron Bousso in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Louise Heavens and Bill Trott","On January 15, 2018, oil prices hovered near a three-year high, with Brent crude at $70.16 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at $64.81, levels not seen since December 2014.

"Senior guard Gabe DeVoe scored 17 points to lead four teammates in double figures, as No. 20 Clemson defeated Notre Dame, 67-58, in an Atlantic Coast Conference game Saturday at Littlejohn Coliseum in Clemson, S.C.
Clemson improved to 16-3 overall and 5-2 in ACC play, while the Fighting Irish slipped to 13-7, 3-4 with their fourth consecutive ACC loss.
The Tigers are 11-0 at Littlejohn Coliseum this season, including 4-0 in ACC games, and defeated Notre Dame for the first time in six tries since the Irish joined the league in basketball five seasons ago.
The bad news for Clemson? Senior forward Donte Grantham suffered an apparent knee injury with 10:54 left in the game and did not return. Grantham, the Tigers’ second-leading scorer, had 11 points before the injury.
Junior guard Shelton Mitchell scored 10 of his 12 points in the second half while Marcquise Reed also had 12.
Freshman guard T.J. Gibbs had 18 points for Notre Dame, and sophomore forward John Mooney came off the bench to add a career-high 13 points. Senior forward Martinas Geben added 10 points and nine rebounds.
Clemson never trailed in the contest. The Tigers made their first seven shots from the floor to start the game, jumping out to a 17-8 lead behind DeVoe, who had 14 points in the first half.
The Tigers extended their advantage to as many as 11 on three occasions in the first half before a late flurry by Notre Dame enabled the Fighting Irish to cut their deficit to just three, 33-30, by halftime.
The Fighting Irish pulled within one point, 47-46, with 10 minutes remaining, but Mitchell scored five straight points to give Clemson some breathing room.
Notre Dame cut its deficit to three, 59-56, on a 3-pointer by Matt Farrell with 2:20 remaining, but Clemson freshman Aamir Simms responded with a 3-pointer -- the first of his career at Littlejohn Coliseum -- and the Tigers connected on four of seven free throws in the final 46 seconds to keep Notre Dame at bay.
Farrell was held to a season-low six points and Notre Dame shot just 38.7 percent, its third-lowest percentage of the season.

Some corporations have reacted to the passage of sweeping tax reform legislation by announcing stock buybacks, raising wages or planning to give bonuses. Sen. Rob Portman , R-Ohio, says the best news is yet to come. 
""I've talked to a number of CEOs over the past several months about the tax reform as it relates to international business. They can now be competitive here in America,"" Portman told CNBC's "" Squawk Box "" on Thursday. 
""I think you'll see some big news coming up as to companies that are literally moving factories from overseas back to the United States,"" he said. 
A bevy of changes to the tax code at the individual, corporate and international level came into effect at the start of 2018. Large companies are getting a big cut to the corporate tax rate — down to 21 percent from 35 percent — and a new expensing period that allows them to deduct the cost of some assets. 
And a number of companies have announced perks and financial gifts for employees. Some of them have directly cited the new tax law as the reason for giving out bonuses or buying back stock. 
In Portman's state, for instance, Columbus-based Nationwide Insurance announced on Wednesday that it will give a $1,000 bonus to most of its 33,000 employees. 
Other companies, such as Wells Fargo and Fifth Third , promised to raise their minimum wages in the wake of the new tax law. 
Individual tax cuts and beefed-up deductions have also come into effect, though most of them will expire in 2025. 
Portman chalked up the unpopularity of the tax bill to the general distrust surrounding Washington, but reiterated the sense of corporate optimism he said he's witnessed since it became law. 
""Companies that are invested in Ohio are now saying they're going to put more money into Ohio,"" Portman said. ""They're telling me that because the lower rates and the expensing makes it better to put an investment in America rather than in Japan or in China or in Germany."" Kevin Breuninger Special to CNBC.com Related Securities","Following the tax reform legislation effective January 2018, corporate tax rates dropped from 35% to 21%, prompting companies to announce stock buybacks and employee bonuses. For instance, Nationwide Insurance will provide a $1,000 bonus to its 33,000 employees. Wells Fargo and Fifth Third are raising minimum wages. Sen. Rob Portman noted that many CEOs are optimistic about relocating factories back to the U.S., citing improved competitiveness.

"PALM BEACH, Florida (Reuters) - President Donald Trump was briefed on Saturday by U.S. trade envoy Robert Lighthizer on U.S. trade with China and talks on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, a White House spokeswoman said, as the administration considers several new tariff moves in coming weeks.
The meeting comes as Trump mulls whether to impose broad restrictions on steel and aluminum imports and punitive actions against China arising from an investigation into Beijing’s alleged theft of intellectual property.
Lighthizer also briefed Trump on China’s economy and pending trade enforcement actions, as well as the NAFTA negotiations, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement from Florida, where Trump is staying at his Mar-a-Lago resort. She did not provide details.
Lighthizer currently is preparing for the next round of NAFTA talks in Montreal. Washington has taken a hard line in the negotiations, which appear stalled with just two rounds of left, saying that concessions are the only way for Canada and Mexico to keep the deal.
Canada this week welcomed Trump’s suggestion that NAFTA talks could be extended beyond March when Mexico’s presidential election campaign kicks into high gear.
Trump’s opportunity to impose new tariffs or trade quotas follows a U.S. Commerce Department Section 232 investigation that looked into whether foreign steel imports are a threat to U.S. national security. The department submitted the long-awaited report to the White House on Thursday.
Next week, the results of a separate investigation of rising aluminum imports will go to the White House.
China’s excess production capacity for both steel and aluminum has emerged as a major trade irritant for the United States and Europe, prompting them to consider new steps to protect domestic industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese imports.
Meanwhile, China reported on Friday that exports and imports growth slowed in December after surging in the previous month, adding to signs of ebbing economic momentum as the government extends a crackdown on financial risks and factory pollution.
A synchronized uptick in the global economy over the past year has been a boon to China and much of trade-dependent Asia, with Chinese exports in 2017 growing at their quickest pace in four years.
The sharp December imports slowdown, however, is raising concerns that the world’s second-biggest economy faces domestic-demand pressure as authorities turn off cheap credit and restrict speculative financing.

"January 21, 2018 / 3:00 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Tennis-Suarez Navarro hits back to reach quarter-finals Reuters Staff 2 Min Read 
MELBOURNE, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Spain’s Carla Suarez Navarro became the first player through to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open as she dug herself out of a hole to beat Estonian Anett Kontaveit 4-6 6-4 8-6 on Sunday. 
Kontaveit was bidding to reach the last eight of a grand slam for the first time and the 22-year-old had victory in her grasp when she took the first set and broke twice to lead 4-1 in the second set on a muggy day alongside the Yarra river. 
Unseeded Suarez Navarro was given heart when Kontaveit double-faulted to hand one break of serve back and the 29-year-old stormed back to take the second set. 
The deciding set was a real battle and Kontaveit again looked like closing it out when she broke at 4-4 but she faltered and was broken as she served for the match. 
Suarez Navarro enjoyed an outrageous slice of luck when Kontaveit served to stay in the match at 6-7, striking a forehand that hit the net tape twice before wobbling over to give her a second match point. 
She missed that one but on her third opportunity Kontaveit smacked a forehand long to send Suarez Navarro into the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park for the third time where she will face either second seed Caroline Wozniacki or Magdalena Rybarikova. (Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Greg Stutchbury)","On January 21, 2018, Carla Suarez Navarro defeated Anett Kontaveit 4-6, 6-4, 8-6 to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals for the third time.

"January 30, 2018 / 3:18 PM / in 36 minutes LIVE MARKETS-Pressure's on: European earnings in the spotlight Reuters Staff 17 Min Read Jan 30 (Reuters) - Welcome to the home for real time coverage of European equity markets brought to you by Reuters stocks reporters and anchored today by Helen Reid. Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net PRESSURE'S ON: EUROPEAN EARNINGS IN THE SPOTLIGHT (1500 GMT) The pressure is on for European equities in 2018 to deliver a convincing sequel to last year's impressive earnings comeback. The recovery in earnings underpins investors' conviction the region is a buy, and should the numbers show signs of fading, international and cross-asset investors may start pulling back. ""In Europe we'd had an absence of top line growth. Our hope and belief is now as that top line growth reappears there should be some decent operating leverage to come through,"" says Marcus Morris-Eyton, portfolio manager, European equities at Allianz Global Investors. Valuations still make Europe relatively attractive, too. ""In Europe you have valuations at a 30 percent discount to U.S."" Investors' hopes for European earnings come against a backdrop of global earnings expectations also rising strongly (see chart) - but Europe, the latest to emerge from its drawn-out earnings slump, is particularly feeling the heat. (Helen Reid) STOXX 600 ON TRACK FOR WORST DAY IN SIX WEEKS (1412 GMT)","As of January 30, 2018, European equities face pressure to deliver strong earnings following a significant recovery in the previous year. Valuations in Europe are 30% lower than in the U.S., but concerns arise as the STOXX 600 is on track for its worst day in six weeks, with investors wary of potential declines in earnings growth."
"Whether you prefer calling it a 'correction' or a 'blip', things have taken a turn for the worse in afternoon trading. The STOXX 600 just hit a session low and is now trading down 0.8 percent, on track for its biggest one-day fall in six weeks, since Dec 20. Banks and miners are still leading the slide which accelerated as U.S. futures sank. The bank sector is down 1.4 percent and set for its worst fall in five months. Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures are trading down 0.7 to 1 percent as the rise in bond yields weighs and Apple again falls 1.1 percent in premarket trading. The VIX index of S&P 500 volatility has crept up to its highest level since Dec 1, crossing the 14 mark for the first time in nearly two months. Just as, with January nearing a close, New Year greetings and resolutions go stale, so the New Year 'melt-up' seems to have reached an existential impasse. (Helen Reid) LOOKING FOR HEDGES? CONSIDER THE SMI (1320 GMT) Rising bond yields, trade war worries, stretched stock valuations have generated a mild risk-off mood and with the ""correction"" word sneaking back into market commentary, fund managers are looking for ways to protect their portfolios. Strategists at Natixis recommend considering Switzerland and its top share index SMI as they draw a comparison to Japan's Nikkei.","the STOXX 600 is down 0.8%, marking its largest one-day drop in six weeks. The bank sector has fallen 1.4%, its worst in five months. U.S. futures are down 0.7% to 1%, with Apple dropping 1.1%. The VIX index has risen above 14, its highest since December 1."
"Japan and Switzerland both enjoy currencies with a safe haven status, making their equity markets an interesting case but Natixis has found a key difference. ""It is no secret that JPY and Nikkei Index are inversely correlated. Businesses in Japan have enjoyed benefits from cheaper currency and expansionary monetary policy. On the other hand, SMI Index and CHF have not shown strong relation to one another,"" they say. ""Switzerland’s export GDP growth has been similar to that of Japan and the two central banks conducted an asset purchasing program, though SNB operated in a quiet and discreet way during 2009-2010, with a negative policy rate. Factors for JPY and Nikkei correlation have not had an impact on the Swiss financial market,"" they add. As a result the SMI could be a relatively good bet even when risk-off is on the rise. ""In addition to a stronger performance during risk-on periods, the SMI index also provides greater excess return than Nikkei during risk-off periods,"" they conclude. (Danilo Masoni) **** MEANWHILE, THE EURO BREAK-UP INDEX HITS AN ALL-TIME LOW (1254 GMT)","Japan's JPY and Nikkei Index are inversely correlated, benefiting from a cheaper currency and expansionary policy, while Switzerland's SMI Index and CHF show weak correlation. Both countries have similar export GDP growth, but SMI offers better returns during risk-off periods. Euro Break-Up Index hits an all-time low."
"""At the beginning of 2018 the euro zone is more robust than ever,"" writes behavioural finance analysis house sentix. Its Euro Break-Up Index has hit its lowest ever level, indicating investors are less fearful than ever of the currency union unravelling. This month's reading shows that just 6.9 percent of all surveyed investors expect the euro to break up in the next 12 months. That compares to the high of 73 percent in July 2012 in the depths of the euro zone debt crisis. The one area of concern? Italy: sentix's sub-index for the country rose this month to 5.22%, meaning investors see it ""as most likely to be regarded as a candidate for exit from the euro"". Analysts at sentix expect this to increase until Italy's election on March 4. (Helen Reid) EUROPEAN EQUITIES: GROWTH VS VALUE (1207) As we pointed out in yesterday's blog, years of low interest rates helped propel the performance of growth stocks as investors were happy to buy into the promise of future earnings. The rise in bond yields may increase the appeal of ""jam today"" in he form of ""value"" stocks.","As of early 2018, the Euro Break-Up Index reached its lowest level, with only 6.9% of surveyed investors fearing a euro breakup, down from 73% in July 2012. Italy's exit risk sub-index rose to 5.22%, indicating growing concerns ahead of the March 4 election."
"Allianz Global Investors is watching carefully to see if bond yields are rising more because of solid economic growth, or due to an inflation risk coupled with subdued growth. If it’s the former, “then people won’t want to pay so much of a premium for resilient growth if they can get more cyclical recovery,” said Simon Gergel, Chief Investment Officer for UK Equities. If the latter, “then I think the typical growth stocks will probably do better”. Gergel sees the UK market polarized between higher growth international companies that are seen as more resilient like Unilever or Diageo and then smaller domestic cyclical players facing the brunt of Brexit economic risk and a potential change of government. Among Gergel’s more recent buys: Barclays, Bovis Homes, Land Securities . He also holds IG Group, National Grid, Shell (took some profits recently), BP. (Tom Pfeiffer) **** TELECOMS FACE REGULATORY TECTONIC SHIFT AS FANGS TARGETED (1143 GMT) HSBC has taken a look at the interface of telecoms and technology regulation and for once there's good news for phone companies, which have been the top underperformers in Europe over the last few years whereas tech has done brightly. ""After years of being on the receiving end of onerous rules imposed at the behest of Silicon Valley (i.e., net neutrality), there is now a tectonic shift underway for telecoms. The FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) have fallen from grace, and telecoms operators are looking to capitalise on this,"" HSBC analysts led by Stephen Howard say in a note.","Allianz Global Investors is monitoring bond yields, influenced by either solid economic growth or inflation risks. Simon Gergel notes a UK market split between resilient international firms like Unilever and domestic cyclical players facing Brexit risks. Recent buys include Barclays and Land Securities. Meanwhile, telecoms may benefit from a regulatory shift as FANGs decline, with telecoms previously underperforming in Europe."
"""We very much doubt operators can seize the role of ‘innovation dynamo’ from the technology giants, and even net neutrality regulation is secure for the present (at least in Europe). However, one advantage of the new climate is that regulators now have, in the form of the FANGs, a fresh set of targets with a far higher media profile than that of the stolid telecoms operators,"" they add. Arguably any regulatory benefit may take time to materialise, but some investors are starting to consider the shifting regulatory environment as they look for fresh long-term opportunities. As you can see in the chart telecoms have led sectoral underperformers in Europe over the last 3 years, while tech has led the gainers. (Danilo Masoni) INSURANCE SECTOR REACHES A ""CRITICAL JUNCTURE"" (1126 GMT) Among the positivity on cyclicals (though not on a day like today), this is the positive view on Europe's insurance sector from Jefferies analysts. They estimate that the value of the sector gains 6 percent for a 50bps upward move in yields. Jefferies adds that an increase in yields benefits the primary life sector most. ""The primary conglomerates remain highly investible, in our view, with our investment focus on those companies continuing to refine capital allocation,"" Jefferies analysts say in a note. However, they do add that, in the event of a 10 percent equity market sell-off, reinsurance and non-life biased stocks such as Allianz and Zurich are the most defensive under such a scenario.","telecoms have underperformed in Europe over the past 3 years, while tech has led gains. Jefferies analysts note that a 50bps yield increase could boost the insurance sector by 6%. They highlight that primary life sectors benefit most, but in a 10% equity market sell-off, stocks like Allianz and Zurich are deemed most defensive."
"(Kit Rees) MORE INVESTORS LOOK AT DIALLING DOWN RISK (1054 GMT) PIMCO’s European global wealth management team say they've found some of their financial intermediary clients in Europe have been looking at reducing risk in their portfolios. This has proven tricky in an environment of zero or negative real returns on cash, PIMCO adds. But they have two potential solutions: low volatility absolute return strategies and core bond strategies, especially those with a U.S. focus. ""Increasing core bond exposure is the more contrarian view; many clients say they plan to decrease allocations in the coming year,"" Ryan P. Blute, managing director and head of PIMCO’s global wealth management business in EMEA, says in a note. ""However, core bonds can play an important diversification role in a portfolio, and U.S. Treasuries in particular remain a source of high quality duration, historically outperforming when there are significant declines in equity or credit markets."" (Kit Rees) TECH OUTPERFORMS, BUT APPLE AND SUPPLIERS REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE(1038 GMT) While tech is outperforming the market today in a recovery from yesterday's jitters, Frankfurt-listed shares in Apple are falling 1.6 percent to hit their lowest in three months. The bearish sentiment from that Nikkei report we mentioned earlier still seems to be taking its toll, and it's interesting to note that iPhone suppliers Dialog Semiconductor, AMS and ASMI are among the worst-performing in the sector. (Helen Reid) IS A CORRECTION ON THE CARDS?","PIMCO's European wealth management team reports that clients are seeking to reduce portfolio risk amid zero or negative real cash returns. They suggest low volatility absolute return and core bond strategies, despite many clients planning to decrease bond allocations. Meanwhile, tech stocks are recovering, but Apple shares fell 1.6%, marking a three-month low, impacting suppliers like Dialog Semiconductor and AMS."
"(0845 GMT) A negative day like today lays bare investor concerns about a more potent pullback in equity markets.

"A slide in Apple shares was the catalyst for the weaker U.S. session, after a Nikkei report said the tech giant would halve its iPhone X production.

Under terms of the deal, Suncor and Teck will fund more of the C$17 billion ($13.56 billion) project’s capital cost - C$300 million and C$120 million more respectively. Suncor’s share of the project will be 53.06 percent, compared to 20.89 percent for Teck and 26.05 percent for Total.

"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s legal chief, whose watch was marked by instances of perceived interference by China in the city’s rule of law, stepped down on Friday, more than four years before the end of his term.
An independent legal system sits at the core of the wide-ranging autonomy promised after Britain handed its former colony back to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees it freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen had resigned for personal reasons, after starting his second five-year term in July.
“He has been a pillar of strength in upholding the rule of law in Hong Kong,” Lam said.
But Yuen’s time in office was punctuated by several controversies, including two rare protests by hundreds of lawyers.
Yuen, 53, was one of the key officials tasked with promoting a contentious political reform package in 2014, which later helped trigger the months-long “Umbrella Movement” street protests demanding, in vain, full democracy for the city.
He was targeted by demonstrators after reports last year that he had overruled several senior public prosecutors to seek jail terms for three democrats involved in those protests, including Joshua Wong, the bespectacled young activist who became the public face of the demonstrations.
He was also criticized for pushing through an immigration arrangement that would allow Chinese officials to implement mainland laws inside a downtown high-speed railway station.
Yuen and Communist Party officials in Beijing argued that parts of the station would be legally regarded as “mainland Chinese territory”, so the city’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which explicitly says national laws don’t apply in Hong Kong, would not be applicable.
The Hong Kong Bar Association called Beijing’s move “the most retrograde step to date in the implementation of the Basic Law”.
On each occasion, “the ultimate decision was made in accordance with the law”, Yuen said on Friday, even though some people might not like the results.
Yuen also reportedly tried to dissuade Beijing from interfering in a court case against pro-independence lawmakers last year, and spoke openly about how “matters that can be properly handled within Hong Kong’s legal or judicial system should be left to be dealt with at the Hong Kong level as much as possible”.
The Chinese parliament ultimately issued an interpretation of the law, pre-empting the judge’s decision, effectively barring the lawmakers from their posts. That prompted 2,000 lawyers to march in protest against what they said was the most blatant interference in the city’s judicial independence.
Incoming Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng, 59, said her “prime mission” would be to uphold the rule of law and that she would pursue criminal prosecutions “without any interference”.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will give a U.N. agency $60 million (43.50 million pounds) in aid for Palestinians but withhold a further $65 million for now, a U.S. official said on Tuesday as the Trump administration appeared to carry out a threat it made two weeks ago to cut funding. Boxes containing aid from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) are seen ahead of their transfer to the Gaza Strip, inside the Kerem Shalom border crossing terminal between Israel and Gaza Strip January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Amir Cohen 
While saying the decision would sustain schools and health services, the U.S. official echoed U.S. President Donald Trump in calling on other nations to provide more funds because he believes the United States pays more than its share. The decision to keep back some money is likely to compound the difficulty of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and to further undermine Arabs’ faith that the United States can act as an impartial arbitrator, particularly following Trump’s Dec. 6 announcement reversing decades of U.S. policy and recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. A Palestinian official quickly criticized Washington’s decision to keep back some of the money and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was unaware of any change on aid but he was “very concerned” about the possibility of a cut in funding. The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) that will receive the money needed to be fundamentally reevaluated “in the way it operates and the way it is funded.” “Without the funds we are providing today, UNRWA operations were at risk of running out of funds and closing down. The funds provided by the United States will prevent that from happening for the immediate future,” the official said, saying the additional “$65 million will be held for future consideration.” In a Twitter post on Jan. 2, Trump said that Washington gives the Palestinians ”HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.","On January 16, 2018, the U.S. announced a $60 million aid package for Palestinians through the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) while withholding an additional $65 million. This decision, reflecting a threat made two weeks prior, aims to sustain essential services but may hinder Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. President Trump urged other nations to contribute more, citing that the U.S. pays more than its fair share. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern over potential funding cuts, emphasizing the need for UNRWA's operational reevaluation."
"“They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?” Trump added in his tweet. While the U.S. official did not link the U.S. decision to Trump’s tweet, he made a point often advanced by the president by saying the United States had been UNRWA’s single largest donor for decades and demanded other nations do more. “It is time other countries, some of them quite wealthy, step in and do their part to advance regional security and stability,” the official said. Trump’s aides initially debated whether to cut off all UNRWA aid after the tweet, a second U.S. official said. But those opposed to the idea argued that it could further destabilize the region, the official said. “This decision confirms the U.S administration is continuing in wiping out the rights of the Palestinian people,” Palestine Liberation Organization official Wasel Abu Youssef told Reuters. “First was declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and today the refugee issue,” he said. Historically, U.S. administrations had said the status of Jerusalem must be decided in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The city is holy to three major monotheistic faiths.","Trump criticized the Palestinians for refusing peace talks with Israel, questioning future U.S. payments. The U.S. has been UNRWA's largest donor for decades, with calls for wealthier nations to contribute. A decision to cut UNRWA aid was debated, with concerns about regional destabilization. Jerusalem's status remains contentious in peace discussions."
"At the United Nations, Guterres told reporters that the services provided by UNRWA were “of extreme importance, not only for the wellbeing of these populations ... but also in my opinion and an opinion that is shared by most international observers, including some Israeli ones, it is an important factor of stability.” “So if UNRWA will not be in a position to provide the vital services and the emergency forms of support that UNRWA has been providing this will create a very, very serious problem and we will do everything we can to avoid this situation,” he said.

Notching up their 11th straight month of gains, reserves rose $20.2 billion in December to $3.14 trillion, the highest since September 2016 and the biggest monthly increase since July, central bank data showed on Sunday. 
That compares with an increase of $10 billion in November. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to rise by $6 billion to $3.125 trillion. 
Capital flight had been seen as a major risk for China at the start of 2017, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the economy. 
The yuan rose around 6.8 percent against the greenback in 2017, recovering from a 6.5 percent loss in 2016 and reversing three straight years of depreciation. 
The value of gold reserves rose to $76.47 billion at the end of December, from $75.833 billion at the end of November, data on the PBOC website also showed.

"January 25, 2018 / 5:10 PM / in 34 minutes UPDATE 1-Venezuela to resume local trading of hard-currency securities Reuters Staff 
(Recasts with dollar-denominated securities) 
By Corina Pons and Deisy Buitrago 
CARACAS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Venezuela will allow securities denominated in hard currency to trade on a local bourse, the central bank said on Thursday, allowing citizens to legally acquire foreign exchange without going through the country’s 15-year-old currency controls. 
The crisis-stricken OPEC nation is struggling under hyperinflation and product shortages that economists widely blame on currency controls that even ruling Socialist Party officials recognize have been plagued with corruption. 
Creating legal mechanisms to obtain dollars could make it easier for businesses to import raw materials or machine parts. 
But it is unlikely to ease the economic crisis because the local bolivar currency has lost more than 99 percent of its value on the black market, leaving local firms largely unable to afford products acquired abroad. 
“This currency arrangement will reopen the market for securities for private citizens,” Central Bank Director Pedro Maldonado said in a press conference. “Any private company that wants to issue debt in hard currency can sell it on the Bicentenary Exchange,” he said, referring to a state-run bourse. 
Between 2004 and 2010, local trading of dollar securities served as a parallel foreign exchange market known as “permuta” that provided hard currency to buyers who did not have permits to acquire it at a state-backed favorable rate. 
The government of late President Hugo Chavez shut down the legal avenue for such trading in 2010, arguing that speculators were using it to damage the economy. 
Buying dollars on the black market continues to be seen as legally suspect despite being routine. 
The central bank separately said the government-backed DICOM auction system, which was halted last year, will start selling euros. President Nicolas Maduro suspended DICOM in responses to financial sanctions by Washington. 
Venezuela’s exchange controls provide dollars at the official rate of 10 bolivars for import of priority goods such as food and medicine. The black market rate is currently 263,803 per dollar, according to web-site DolarToday, which is the most widely-used reference. 
The central bank did not say what the new DICOM exchange rate would be. A Powerpoint presentation about DICOM says buyers will “pay the price they proposed.” 
Before the auctions were halted, DICOM was selling dollars at 3,345 bolivars. Though the DICOM rate has been consistently more favorable than the black market, businesses generally say it is of little use because it sells limited volumes, meaning it does not provide a steady supply of hard currency for imports. (Reporting by Corina Pons; Writing by Brian Ellsworth; Editing by Susan Thomas)","On January 25, 2018, Venezuela announced the resumption of local trading for hard-currency securities, allowing citizens to legally acquire foreign exchange amid ongoing hyperinflation and product shortages. The bolivar has lost over 99% of its value on the black market, where the current rate is 263,803 bolivars per dollar, compared to the official rate of 10 bolivars for priority imports. The DICOM auction system, previously halted, will now sell euros, with the last known dollar rate at 3,345 bolivars. This move aims to facilitate imports but is unlikely to alleviate the economic crisis significantly."
"ANKARA (Reuters) - Two rockets fired from the Syrian region of Afrin struck the Turkish border town of Kilis on Wednesday, wounding 13 people, the local governor said.
The rockets hit two locations in the city center, including a mosque during prayer times, Governor Mehmet Tekinarslan said. Eight people were wounded, with two in critical condition, at the mosque, and another five injured at the second location.
Turkish media footage showed security forces clearing the areas of civilians following the attacks, as ambulances and emergency teams arrived at the site.
As Turkey’s operation against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin entered its fifth day, several rockets have hit the Turkish border towns of Kilis and Reyhanli.

ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States needs to withdraw from northern Syria’s Manbij region immediately, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Saturday. 
President Tayyip Erdogan on Friday said Turkish forces would sweep Kurdish fighters from the Syrian border and could push all the way east to the frontier with Iraq, including Manbij - a move which risks a possible confrontation with U.S. forces allied to the Kurds. 
Speaking to reporters, Cavusoglu also said Turkey wanted to see concrete steps by the United States to end its support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia.

Other operating expenses decreased $325,000 to $10.5 million for the year ended 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to a $296,000 decrease in directors’ share-based compensation expense as a result of the majority of the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan fully vesting in September 2016. Income tax expense
Income tax expense was $13.9 million for the year ended 2017 compared to $5.9 million for the year ended 2016. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company recorded a reduction in the value of its net deferred tax asset resulting in a charge of $5.0 million to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. Income tax expense in 2016 included a $137,000 write-off of a deferred tax asset associated with the establishment of the Bank’s foundation in 2011. December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016

"In addition to evaluating the Company’s financial performance in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management routinely supplements their evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as core net income, the efficiency ratio and tangible book value per share. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure; net income in the case of core net income and the efficiency ratio and stockholders’ equity in the case of tangible book value per share, appears in the accompanying Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures table. We believe that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial performance, our performance trends and financial position. Specifically, we provide measures based on what we believe are our operating earnings on a consistent basis and exclude non-core operating items which affect the GAAP reporting of results of operations. The Company believes that core net income is useful for both investors and management to understand the effects of items that are non-recurring and infrequent in nature. The Company believes that the efficiency ratio, which measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, is useful in the assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control. The Company believes that tangible book value per share is useful to evaluate the relative strength of the Company’s capital position. The Company does not have goodwill and intangible assets for any of the periods presented. As such, tangible book value per common share is equal to book value per common share. We utilize these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.","Management evaluates financial performance using GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including core net income, efficiency ratio, and tangible book value per share. Core net income aids in understanding non-recurring items, while the efficiency ratio assesses costs per revenue dollar. Tangible book value per share reflects capital strength, equating to book value as there are no goodwill or intangible assets. These measures support internal planning and investor insights."
"These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

"0 COMMENTS U.S. government bonds strengthened Tuesday after Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda undercut speculation that the central bank was close to ending its postcrisis stimulus policies.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 2.622%, compared with 2.663% Monday, logging its first decline after four sessions of increases. Yields fall when bond prices rise.
Following the BOJ’s latest policy meeting, Mr. Kuroda said the central bank wasn’t ready to even discuss an exit to its monetary stimulus, given that inflation was still less than halfway to the bank’s target.
That message helped bolster government bonds across developed markets, sending a cautionary signal to investors that major central banks could take their time in shifting to tighter monetary policies despite an improved global-growth outlook.
Investors and analysts widely agree that bond-buying programs by the BOJ and European Central Bank have played a large role in dragging down yields globally. The purchases have made bonds in those regions more scarce and driven yield-starved investors to buy U.S. fixed-income assets.
Investors have speculated recently that better economic data would allow both the BOJ and ECB to stop adding to their bond portfolios, contributing to a large increase in Treasury yields.
After finishing 2017 at 2.409%, the 10-year Treasury yield moved above 2.6% last week and settled Monday at its highest level since April 2014.
Stoking the speculation about central banks, minutes from the ECB’s December meeting revealed officials “widely” agreed that the bank needed to change its guidance to investors early this year to better reflect the state of the eurozone economy. Earlier this month, the BOJ also bought fewer long-term Japanese government bonds than investors had expected, a move that added to market jitters even as some analysts dismissed it as unimportant.
Many investors and analysts expect the Treasurys market to remain under pressure in the coming months, as long as the economy stays on its current trajectory.
“In general we think over the next couple of months yields should across the curve grind higher,” said John Herrmann, rates strategist at MUFG Securities in New York. One possibility, he said, is that the Federal Reserve could raise its forecasts for economic growth and inflation, causing a big jump in long-term Treasury yields.
Though consumer prices have been rising slowly, many investors expect falling unemployment to eventually lead to higher inflation, which is a main threat to government bonds because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed payments and can make it easier for the Fed to raise interest rates.

Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks looked set for a softer opening on Monday, easing from record levels hit last week and as investors brace for a busy week in terms of earnings and economic reports.
Also likely to weigh was Apple’s 0.76 percent drop in premarket trading after the Nikkei reported the company would make half the number of iPhone Xs than planned this quarter. Apple is set to report results later this week.
U.S. Treasury yields were at multi-year highs, extending gains from last week on the back of strong economic data and as investors braced for major central banks to step back from ultra-easy monetary policies.
The Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting starts Tuesday. And while no interest rate hike is expected, outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s last statement will be scrutinized for clues on the future path of rate hikes.
The nonfarm payrolls report on Friday is also expected to show the U.S. economy added more jobs in January than in December.
Besides Apple, heavyweights Alphabet, Facebook , Microsoft and Amazon are to report results this week, as are Dow components Pfizer and DowDuPont.
“The upcoming results should provide further evidence of a strong earnings season under way,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York, wrote in a client note.
“Investors’ confidence remains strong and it is likely to strengthen. However, the amount of money being poured into stocks is one more reason to be more cautious than ever.”

LONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - A rise in banks and oil stocks boosted the UK’s top share index to a fresh record on Wednesday as climbing bond yields supported financials across Europe. 
Britain’s blue chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent at 7,748.51 points, a new closing record and outperforming the broader European market, while mid-caps declined 0.6 percent. 
British banks joined in a rally with European peers as bond yields rose. The gains in financials added 37 points to the FTSE. 
“When there’s movement in the bond yields, the UK banks do benefit from that in a number of ways. Firstly, they make higher revenues in terms of their returns,” John Moore, trader at Berkeley Capital, said. 
“We think UK banks could do quite well despite the uncertainty, purely because we see them as undervalued.” 
Royal Bank of Scotland led the FTSE 100, up 4.6 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on the stock to “overweight”. 
Morgan Stanley said RBS was the most resilient UK bank in an uncertain outlook. 
RBS peers HSBC and Standard Chartered also gained 3.7 and 3.3 percent as banks across the region rallied, with the pan-European banks index at a two-year high thanks to rising bond yields. 
Wednesday was another day dominated by Christmas updates from retailers, with shares in grocer Sainsbury’s advancing 1.9 percent after it beat forecasts slightly in its Christmas trading update. 
“Sainsbury’s has delivered reassuring trading through what, post the Argos acquisition, is its key quarter for sales and profitability,” analysts at UBS said in a note. 
This continued a positive theme for food retailers over the festive period as shoppers resisted cutting back on food purchases despite inflationary pressures on the consumer. 
Peer Morrisons enjoyed a rally in the previous session after its own update. 
Sainsbury’s however cautioned the market for general merchandise and clothing would be tough in 2018, and mixed results from non-food retailers on Wednesday reflected this difficult environment. 
Ted Baker shares jumped 9.7 percent to lead the mid-cap index, thanks to a surge in online purchases for the fashion retailer, helping Christmas sales. 
Other clothing retailers fared considerably less well, with small-cap Moss Brothers tumbling 16 percent and Superdry down 9.3 percent at the bottom of the FTSE 250. 
Liberum analysts said the weakest retail segments have been electronics, clothing and fashion. 
Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey found itself at the bottom of the FTSE 100, however, down 4.2 percent on the back of a trading statement. 
The housebuilder said its full-year results for 2017 would be in line with expectations. 
Elsewhere a warning from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) put pressure on shares in spreadbetters, with IG Group dropping 4.4 percent, Plus500 down 5.5 percent and CMC Markets down 2.3 percent. 
The FCA said its review of the industry found “areas of serious concern” in Britain’s contracts for differences (CFDs) market. Reporting by Kit Rees and Helen Reid; editing by Mark Heinrich, William Maclean","On January 10, 2018, the UK's FTSE 100 index reached a new record of 7,748.51 points, up 0.2%, driven by a rally in banks and oil stocks as bond yields rose.

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa. L ) won five of the first eight oil and gas blocks awarded in Mexico’s prized deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, making the early running in the country’s biggest auction since the energy sector was opened to international oil firms. The stakes are high for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and his ruling party, which is keen to showcase the results of the liberalization ahead of a presidential election in July. Shell, in a consortium with Qatar Petroleum, won four of the first nine blocks on offer in the Perdido basin, which is close to U.S. waters where oil firms already operate and have infrastructure. The Anglo-Dutch company won one block in consortium with Mexican state oil firm Pemex. Pemex won one block, and three blocks were not awarded because they received no bids. Competition for the basin was expected to be fierce, but a consortium of Shell and Qatar Petroleum was the sole bidder on three blocks. “Mexico is the winner here,” said Alberto de la Fuente, president of Shell Mexico. Shell would spend more than the minimum investment it pledged in the bids, he said, but declined to give further details. Shell won a block in an earlier auction in Mexico’s shallow waters in 2017.","Royal Dutch Shell won 5 of the first 8 oil and gas blocks in Mexico's Gulf of Mexico auction, the largest since energy liberalization. In a consortium with Qatar Petroleum, Shell secured 4 of 9 blocks in the Perdido basin, while Pemex won 1 block. Three blocks received no bids."
"The company also has a chain of 30 gas stations in Mexico, he said. Three other blocks were awarded in the auction. PC Carigali, a unit of Malaysia’s state oil firm Petronas, was part of three different consortia that won those blocks. “We’re excited,” said Faisal Bakar, Carigali’s country manager in Mexico. “We’re in, we want to explore and we want to find oil and gas.” Carigali also participated in winning bids for two deep water fields in an earlier auction.

OIL PRICE HELPS The world’s top energy firms have lobbied for decades for access to Mexico’s oil and gas reserves. State oil giant Pemex","PC Carigali, part of Petronas, won three auction blocks and previously secured two deep water fields, while operating 30 gas stations in Mexico, amid ongoing interest from major energy firms in the country's reserves."
"[PEMX.UL], whose 75-year monopoly over the energy sector ended under Mexico’s 2013 reform, lacked the cash and expertise to extract oil and gas from the rock below the country’s deepest waters. With oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 near a three-year high, energy firms are emerging from a recession. They have more cash now than at any time since 2014, so conditions are better than they were for any of the eight auctions Mexico has held since 2015. The higher oil price helped Shell to put in solid bids, de la Fuente said. Shell was also a big winner in an oil auction for blocks in Brazil’s deepwater in October, snapping up three blocks in the presalt region in the country’s Atlantic waters. Mexico faces stiff competition from Brazil and other regional rivals keen to attract cash from global oil majors. Argentina, Uruguay and Ecuador are also auctioning oil and gas fields this year. The wide-ranging energy reform was Pena Nieto’s highest-profile economic initiative, aimed at attracting hundreds of billions of dollars of investment to turn around a state-run oil industry in decline.","Mexico's energy sector, previously monopolized for 75 years, is now more competitive post-2013 reform. With oil prices near a three-year high, firms have more cash than since 2014. Mexico's eight auctions since 2015 face competition from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Ecuador."
"The results of previous auctions to attract foreign investment were mixed. Firms that won in the previous auctions have pledged investments of $61 billion. But Mexico needs 10 times that amount to raise oil output back to 2004 levels, the country’s Energy Secretary Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said on Tuesday. The southeastern portion of the Salina basin should also see strong interest, oil executives and industry executives said. (Graphic on the blocks: tmsnrt.rs/2DGpgnB )
Some of the firms that won in previous auctions have made big finds, adding over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to reserves. Mexico is expected to hold its first shale oil and gas auction by the end of 2018, the head of the country’s oil regulator said on Wednesday, potentially opening up one of the world’s top reserves of unconventional energy.

"BANJUL (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Jobless, restless and frustrated, 24-year-old Saikou Jammeh persuaded his father to sell the family home and give up his life savings to pay for the journey from Gambia to Europe. Jammeh saw no future for himself in Gambia, a tiny impoverished country on West Africa’s coast, so he joined an exodus of young men willing to sacrifice everything to leave. But after being robbed, beaten, and locked in a Libyan prison for several months, Jammeh found himself back where he started - in Gambia with no job prospects and empty pockets. “I felt abandoned by the government,” he said on a busy street in Churchill’s Town, a suburb of the capital Banjul. “I was just sitting, wondering what to do.” Thousands of thwarted migrants like Jammeh are returning to Gambia, straining its fledgling government as officials scramble to get European-funded reintegration projects up and running. President Adama Barrow took office a year ago, ending former leader Yahya Jammeh’s 22 years of autocratic rule, and is under pressure to deliver on promises of sweeping economic reforms. Nearly 2,500 Gambians were flown home by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) last year, most pulled out of prisons in Libya after reports emerged of Africans being sold in slave markets in the lawless country, the U.N. agency said. The returnees are a noticeable presence in the nation of 2 million, posing a bigger threat to stability than in other West African countries wrestling with migration, experts said. “We are not ready to receive all these people,” said Bulli Dibba, permanent secretary of Gambia’s interior ministry.","Saikou Jammeh, 24, returned to Gambia after a harrowing journey to Europe, where he faced robbery, beatings, and imprisonment in Libya. Nearly 2,500 Gambians were repatriated last year, many from Libyan prisons, straining the government of the 2 million-population nation. President Adama Barrow, in office for a year, faces pressure for economic reforms following 22 years of autocratic rule under Yahya Jammeh."
"“We are very much concerned for domestic security,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. In November, a group of newly-returned migrants threw rocks at the IOM offices because they were unhappy with the support they had received, according to IOM spokeswoman Florence Kim. “The government is already struggling to deal with unemployment,” added Dibba, a veteran Gambian civil servant. “If we have more people coming in, what will we do with them?”
OUT OF REACH Gambians have accounted for about one in 20 migrants arriving in Italy in recent years, making it the country with the highest number of migrants per capita reaching Europe. Trying to stem the flow, the European Union is funding job training and youth empowerment programs across the continent with its 3.2 billion euro ($4 billion) Trust Fund for Africa. While the fund was created in 2015, most of the programs in Gambia only started last year, according to the IOM. “Thank god my life has grown into a plan,” said Saikou Jammeh, who did an EU-funded CCTV installation course after returning, and is now saving money for school. But many young Gambians are missing out. Of the 2,435 migrants who returned to Gambia in 2017, only 170 so far have received reintegration packages from the IOM, which consist of funding for education or business start-ups. The agency has received complaints, and is striving to avoid tensions and divisions within communities, said Kim of the IOM.
Give one former migrant more money than their peers and you create competition, she said.","Gambians represent 5% of migrants arriving in Italy, the highest per capita in Europe. The EU's 3.2 billion euro ($4 billion) Trust Fund for Africa aims to address unemployment through job training, with programs starting in Gambia last year. In 2017, 2,435 migrants returned, but only 170 received IOM reintegration packages, raising concerns about community tensions, according to IOM spokeswoman Florence Kim."
"Offer returnees more support than their neighbors and it could spur others to leave for Europe. Many of the returned migrants are traumatized, illiterate, or live in remote areas - making them difficult to assist. “I know people who have ideas, but they don’t have any help,” said Donald Greywoode, 36, who quit his office job and set off for Europe on a route known locally as “the back way”. When Greywoode came back, he found himself collecting trash. Without education, training or job opportunities, boredom and resentment could boil over into conflict, analysts said. “The stakes are very, very high,” said Franzisca Zanker, a researcher at Germany’s University of Freiburg, who has studied migration governance in Gambia. UNDETERRED Several returnees told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that they had not wanted to come home, but having been locked up, abused and starved in Libya, were left with no other choice. “We don’t see ourselves as voluntary returnees,” said Mustapha Sallah, 26, who came back from Libya in April. “They said if you don’t want to go home, you die here,” Sallah said. “Leaving was the only option.”","Many returnees, often traumatized and illiterate, struggle in remote areas, leading to potential conflict. Donald Greywoode, 36, returned to trash collection after a failed migration. Mustapha Sallah, 26, felt forced to return from Libya in April, stating, “Leaving was the only option.”"
"Coupled with the lack of opportunity, such frustration could drive people to migrate once more, experts warned. Others said broader economic changes would be needed to keep youth at home. “Even after training all these people in all these skills, if the industry is not there, they will still struggle,” said Kebba Sillah, head of Sterling Consortium, a vocational training institute supported by the EU Trust Fund for Africa. “I think the EU needs to encourage their businesses to come set up here, not just pump in money,” Sillah added. While many returnees said they would never again attempt the treacherous journey through Libya, some still dream of Europe. Jerreh Cham, 22, has received EU funding to complete a satellite installation course and attend business management school since returning from Libya in August. But it is not enough to keep him at home. “My plan is to get my qualification before reaching Europe,” said Cham, sitting in the yard outside his family’s small home. “If I go with my qualification and everything, I don’t think anybody will discount me. I think they will give me my respect.”","Experts warn that frustration from limited opportunities may drive youth to migrate again, despite training. Kebba Sillah, head of a vocational institute, emphasizes the need for industry presence. Jerreh Cham, 22, aims to complete training funded by the EU before pursuing opportunities in Europe."

"Continues focus on commercial applications of human-like intelligence in machines
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kindred Systems Inc. was founded with the mission of creating human-like intelligence in machines and vision to commercialize its research work in tandem. Over the past few years, Kindred’s Product and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) divisions have accomplished a tremendous amount in their respective domains, working independently to allow each team to optimize for their objectives.
The company has reached a point in its evolution where spinning off the AGI division maximizes the likelihood of success for both divisions, as well as returns to Kindred shareholders.
Geordie Rose is stepping down as CEO and President of Kindred to lead this new entity named Sanctuary based in Vancouver, Canada. Kindred co-founder Suzanne Gildert will also be stepping down from her role as Chief Science Officer and will join Sanctuary as co-CEO. Sanctuary’s focus is on the implementation and testing of a specific framework for artificial general intelligence. The new entity will license some of Kindred’s patents and software, and Kindred will maintain a minority ownership in Sanctuary.
Kindred’s Board of Directors has appointed Jim Liefer, previously the company’s COO, to serve as CEO and President. As COO, Liefer brought strong executive leadership alongside co-founder, George Babu, for the development and deployment of Kindred’s first commercial product Sort, and will continue to lead the company in its mission to research and develop human-like intelligence in machines. The Kindred team in Toronto will continue its applied research in machine and reinforcement learning, with the San Francisco office focused on robotics, product development and commercialization.
With Kindred Sort, the company aims to alleviate the massive pressures facing the retail and fulfillment industry, which includes significant online sales growth, labor shortages, and a lack of advancement in technology. Kindred Sort allows retailers to manage the exploding growth and demand of this sector more efficiently. During the 2017 holiday season, Kindred’s robots sorted thousands of items ordered at speeds averaging over 410 units per hour, and reaching peak speeds of over 531 units per hour, freeing human workers to perform other parts of the fulfillment process critical to meet growing customer demand.
“Kindred will maintain its commitment to building human-like intelligence in machines and applying those learnings to create and teach a new intelligent class of robots that will enhance the quality of our day-to-day lives, and in particular, the way we work,” said Liefer. “We look forward to advancing Kindred Sort, achieving new AI and robotic milestones while also helping to drive retail and other industries forward.”
Babu, Kindred co-founder and Chief Product Officer will be joining Liefer on Kindred’s Board of Directors. Babu will continue to oversee product strategy and the expansion of Kindred’s partnerships and pilot programs with major global retailers.
About Kindred
Kindred Systems Inc.’s mission is to build machines with human-like intelligence. The company’s central thesis is that intelligence requires a body. Since its founding in 2014, Kindred has been exploring and engineering systems that enable robots to understand and participate in our world, with the ultimate goal of a future where intelligent machines work together with people. Kindred is headquartered in San Francisco with an office in Toronto.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized net income of $31.8 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to net income of $20.6 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The increase in net income was due primarily to a decrease in income tax expense resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, the impact of which was an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 for the current quarter. The Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax laws, such as a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and changes to and/or limitations on certain income tax deductions. The Company has a fiscal year end of September 30th, so the change in the income tax rate will result in the use of a blended federal income tax rate for fiscal year 2018. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""), the Company applied the blended federal income tax rate to pretax income in the current quarter and revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 22, 2017 to account for the future impact of a lower income tax rate. The revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities contributed $7.5 million to the decrease in income tax expense in the current quarter.","Capitol Federal Financial, Inc. reported a net income of $31.8 million, or $0.24 per share, for the quarter ending December 31, 2017, up from $20.6 million, or $0.15 per share, in the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to a $7.5 million income tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The company paid dividends totaling $50.4 million, or $0.375 per share, and achieved a net interest margin of 1.83%. Detailed results will be available in the upcoming 10-Q filing."
"The benefit of the lower income tax rate is partially offset by the Company recognizing more proportional amortization expense related to its low income housing partnerships in fiscal year 2018 resulting from an adjustment to account for a higher portion of those benefits realized prior to the income tax rate change. Management estimates the effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 to be between 20% and 21% and approximately 22% for fiscal year 2019. Net interest income decreased $284 thousand, or 0.6%, from the prior quarter to $49.4 million for the current quarter. The net interest margin decreased one basis point from 1.84% for the prior quarter to 1.83% for the current quarter. Excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, the net interest margin would have decreased one basis point from 2.21% for the prior quarter to 2.20% for the current quarter. Interest and Dividend Income
The weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets for the current quarter was 2.98%, unchanged from the prior quarter, while the average balance of interest-earning assets decreased $26.0 million between the two periods. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets would have decreased one basis point from the prior quarter, to 3.31%.

354 1.1 The table above includes interest expense on FHLB borrowings both associated and not associated with the leverage strategy. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings not related to the leverage strategy decreased $451 thousand from the prior quarter due mainly to a four basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on the portfolio, to 2.08% for the current quarter, along with a $35.5 million decrease in the average balance of the portfolio. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings associated with the leverage strategy increased $268 thousand from the prior quarter due to a five basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid as a result of an increase in interest rates between periods. The increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a five basis point increase in the weighted average rate, to 0.91% for the current quarter.","In the current quarter, interest income on cash and cash equivalents rose due to a $70.4 million increase in the average balance and a four basis point rise in the yield to 1.29%. Interest expense increased by $354, or 1.1%, totaling $31.27 million, with FHLB borrowings at $17.917 million and deposits at $11.961 million. The weighted average rate on interest-bearing liabilities rose two basis points to 1.29%, while the average balance of these liabilities decreased by $38 million."
"The increase in the weighted average rate was primarily related to the certificate of deposit portfolio, which increased seven basis points to 1.51% for the current quarter. The decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements was due to the maturity of a $100.0 million repurchase agreement during the quarter. Provision for Credit Losses
Capitol Federal Savings Bank (the ""Bank"") did not record a provision for credit losses during the current quarter or the prior quarter. Based on management's assessment of the allowance for credit losses (""ACL"") formula analysis model and several other factors, it was determined that no provision for credit losses was necessary. Net loan charge-offs were $28 thousand during the current quarter compared to $88 thousand in the prior quarter. At December 31, 2017, loans 30 to 89 days delinquent were 0.25% of total loans and loans 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure were 0.15% of total loans. Non-Interest Income

Non-Interest Expense
The following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.","In the current quarter, Capitol Federal Savings Bank's certificate of deposit portfolio increased by 7 basis points to 1.51%.

Non-interest income totaled $5.358 million, a 9.1% decrease from $5.895 million, primarily due to a loss on loan sales and decreased insurance commissions. Loans 30-89 days delinquent were 0.25% of total loans."

(6.1) The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense was due primarily to the prior quarter including compensation expense on unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (""ESOP"") shares related to the True Blue Capitol dividend paid during the prior fiscal year. The increase in information technology and related expense and the decrease in regulatory and outside services were due mainly to a change in the presentation of certain information technology professional and consulting expenses beginning in fiscal year 2018. Information technology professional and consulting expenses are now being reported in information technology and related expenses rather than regulatory and outside services. The decrease in advertising and promotional expense was due primarily to the timing of media campaigns and sponsorships. The Company's efficiency ratio was 40.26% for the current quarter compared to 42.26% for the prior quarter. The change in the efficiency ratio was due primarily to lower non-interest expense in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter. The efficiency ratio is a measure of a financial institution's total non-interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income (pre-provision for credit losses) and non-interest income. A lower value indicates that the financial institution is generating revenue with a proportionally lower level of expense. Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $860 thousand for the current quarter, compared to $11.5 million for the prior quarter.","For the three months ended December 31, 2017, total non-interest expense decreased by $1,443 thousand (6.1%) to $22,036 thousand, driven by a $521 thousand (4.7%) drop in salaries and employee benefits. Information technology expenses rose by $573 thousand (20.8%), while regulatory services fell by $687 thousand (37.6%). The efficiency ratio improved to 40.26% from 42.26%. Income tax expense was $860 thousand, down from $11.5 million."
"The effective tax rate was 2.6% for the current quarter compared to 35.8% for the prior quarter. The lower effective income tax rate and income tax expense were due primarily to revaluing the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as applying a lower corporate income tax rate to the Company's current quarter pretax income. Management estimates the effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 to be between 20% and 21% and approximately 22% for fiscal year 2019. Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016
The Company recognized net income of $31.8 million, or $0.24 per share, for the current quarter compared to net income of $20.6 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was due primarily to a decrease in income tax expense resulting from the Tax Act being signed into law during the quarter. The net interest margin increased 10 basis points, from 1.73% for the prior year quarter to 1.83% for the current quarter. Excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, the net interest margin would have increased 13 basis points, from 2.07% for the prior year quarter to 2.20% for the current quarter. The increase in the net interest margin was due mainly to an increase in interest-earning asset yields, as well as a shift in the mix of interest-earning assets from relatively lower yielding securities to higher yielding loans and a net decrease in the cost of liabilities not related to the leverage strategy. Interest and Dividend Income
The weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets increased 22 basis points, from 2.76% for the prior year quarter to 2.98% for the current quarter, while the average balance of interest-earning assets decreased $141.3 million from the prior year quarter. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets would have increased 11 basis points, from 3.20% for the prior year quarter to 3.31% for the current quarter.","In the current quarter, the effective tax rate dropped to 2.6% from 35.8% in the prior quarter, with management estimating rates of 20-21% for fiscal year 2018 and approximately 22% for 2019. Net income rose to $31.8 million ($0.24 per share) from $20.6 million ($0.15 per share) year-over-year. The net interest margin increased by 10 basis points to 1.83%, while the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets rose 22 basis points to 2.98%, despite a $141.3 million decrease in their average balance."

The increase in interest income on loans receivable was due mainly to a $180.8 million increase in the average balance of the portfolio, as well as a three basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 3.56% for the current quarter. Loan growth was funded through cash flows from the securities portfolio. The increase in the weighted average yield was due primarily to a decrease in the amortization of premiums related to correspondent loans. The increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents was due to a 75 basis point increase in the weighted average yield resulting from an increase in the yield earned on balances held at the FRB of Kansas City. The decrease in interest income on the MBS portfolio was due to a $267.6 million decrease in the average balance of the portfolio, partially offset by a 13 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 2.25% for the current quarter. Cash flows not reinvested were used primarily to fund loan growth and pay off certain maturing FHLB borrowings. The increase in the weighted average yield was due primarily to adjustable-rate MBS repricing to higher market rates, as well as a decrease in the impact of net premium amortization. Net premium amortization of $854 thousand during the current quarter decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 37 basis points. During the prior year quarter, $1.3 million of net premiums were amortized, which decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 43 basis points.","For the three months ended December 31, 2017, total interest and dividend income rose to $80,644,000, a $5,322,000 (7.1%) increase from 2016. Loans receivable income increased by $2,244,000 (3.6%) due to a $180.8 million rise in average balance and a yield increase to 3.56%. Cash and cash equivalents income surged by $4,145,000 (139.6%). However, MBS income fell by $1,110,000 (17.4%) due to a $267.6 million decrease in average balance."
"As of December 31, 2017, the remaining net balance of premiums on our portfolio of MBS was $8.8 million. Interest Expense
The weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities increased 14 basis points, from 1.15% for the prior year quarter to 1.29% for the current quarter, while the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased $110.5 million from the prior year quarter. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities would have decreased one basis point, from 1.30% for the prior year quarter to 1.29% for the current quarter.

The table above includes interest expense on FHLB borrowings both associated and not associated with the leverage strategy. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings not related to the leverage strategy decreased $2.0 million from the prior year quarter due to a $182.3 million decrease in the average balance of the portfolio and a 19 basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on the portfolio, to 2.08% for the current quarter. The decrease in the average balance was a result of using cash flows from the securities portfolio and funds generated from deposit growth to pay off certain advances that matured between periods. The decrease in the weighted average rate paid was due to certain advances maturing between periods being replaced at lower effective rates. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings associated with the leverage strategy increased $3.8 million from the prior year quarter due to a 75 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid as a result of an increase in interest rates between periods.","As of December 31, 2017, the remaining net balance of premiums on the MBS portfolio was $8.8 million. The weighted average rate on interest-bearing liabilities rose 14 basis points to 1.29%, while the average balance decreased by $110.5 million.

"The increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to an 11 basis point increase in the weighted average rate, to 0.91% for the current quarter.

The increase in information technology and related expense and the decrease in regulatory and outside services were due mainly to a change in the presentation of certain information technology professional and consulting expenses beginning in fiscal year 2018, as well as those expenses being higher than the prior year. The increase in other non-interest expense was due mainly to an increase in other real estate owned (""OREO"") operations expense. The Company's efficiency ratio was 40.26% for the current quarter compared to 41.08% for the prior year quarter.","For the current quarter, interest expense on deposits rose due to an 11 basis point increase in the weighted average rate to 0.91%. The certificate of deposit portfolio's rate increased by 18 basis points to 1.51%, while wholesale certificates rose 62 basis points to 1.33%. Non-interest income totaled $5,358, up 1.7%, with retail fees increasing by 6.9% to $3,965. Non-interest expenses rose 2.0% to $22,036, with a 17.5% increase in IT expenses. The efficiency ratio improved to 40.26%."
"The improvement in the efficiency ratio was due primarily to higher net interest income in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $860 thousand for the current quarter compared to $10.4 million for the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate was 2.6% for the current quarter compared to 33.6% for the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was due mainly to the Tax Act being signed into law during the current quarter. Financial Condition as of December 31, 2017
Total assets were $8.99 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $9.19 billion at September 30, 2017. The $202.8 million decrease was due primarily to a $322.5 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in FHLB stock. At December 31, 2017, the Bank was not required by the FHLB to redeem the FHLB stock associated with the leverage strategy. At previous quarter ends, this stock was redeemed. The loans receivable portfolio, net, decreased $5.3 million to $7.19 billion at December 31, 2017, from $7.20 billion at September 30, 2017. During the current quarter, the Bank originated and refinanced $146.6 million of loans with a weighted average rate of 3.84% and purchased $99.8 million of one- to four-family loans from correspondent lenders with a weighted average rate of 3.59%.","For the current quarter, income tax expense was $860K, down from $10.4M, with an effective tax rate of 2.6% versus 33.6% last year. Total assets decreased to $8.99B from $9.19B, with loans receivable at $7.19B. The bank originated $146.6M in loans at 3.84% and purchased $99.8M at 3.59%."
"The Bank also entered into participations of $50.4 million of commercial real estate loans with a weighted average rate of 4.19%, of which $45.2 million had not yet been funded as of December 31, 2017. During the current quarter, the Bank funded $24.8 million of new and existing commercial real estate loans. The Bank is continuing to manage the size of its loan portfolio as it manages its liquidity levels. Loan volume has primarily been maintained through the rates offered to correspondent lenders. Generally, over the past couple years, cash flows from the securities portfolio have been used primarily to purchase loans and in part to pay down FHLB advances. By moving cash from lower yielding assets to higher yielding assets and repaying higher cost liabilities, we have been able to maintain our net interest margin. In addition to the repayment of securities, the Bank has emphasized growth in the deposit portfolio in part to pay down FHLB advances. The ratio of securities and cash to total assets was approximately 15% at December 31, 2017, which is approximately where management would like to maintain that percentage. In the long run, management considers a 10% ratio of stockholders' equity to total assets at the Bank an appropriate level of capital. At December 31, 2017, this ratio was 13.5%.","As of December 31, 2017, the Bank participated in $50.4 million of commercial real estate loans at a 4.19% average rate, with $45.2 million unfunded. It funded $24.8 million in loans, maintained a 15% securities and cash ratio, and achieved a 13.5% stockholders' equity to total assets ratio, above the 10% target."
"The Bank has continued to utilize a leverage strategy to increase earnings in fiscal year 2018. The leverage strategy during the current quarter involved borrowing up to $2.10 billion either on the Bank's FHLB line of credit or by entering into short-term FHLB advances, depending on the rates offered by FHLB. The borrowings were repaid prior to quarter end for regulatory purposes. The proceeds from the borrowings, net of the required FHLB stock holdings, which yielded 6.4% during the current quarter, were deposited at the FRB of Kansas City. Net income attributable to the leverage strategy is largely derived from the dividends received on FHLB stock holdings, plus the net interest rate spread between the yield on the cash at the FRB of Kansas City and the rate paid on the related FHLB borrowings, less applicable federal insurance premiums and estimated taxes. Net income attributable to the leverage strategy was $767 thousand during the current quarter, compared to $642 thousand for the prior year quarter and $633 thousand in the September 30, 2017 quarter. The increase was due primarily to a decrease in the fiscal year 2018 estimated effective tax rate applied to pretax income attributable to the leverage strategy. Total liabilities were $7.64 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $7.82 billion at September 30, 2017. The $185.1 million decrease was due mainly to decreases in repurchase agreements and deposits. Repurchase agreements decreased due to the maturity of a $100.0 million repurchase agreement during the quarter.","In fiscal year 2018, the Bank borrowed up to $2.10 billion through FHLB advances, repaid before quarter-end. The leverage strategy generated a net income of $767,000, up from $642,000 a year prior. Total liabilities decreased by $185.1 million to $7.64 billion, primarily due to a $100 million repurchase agreement maturity. FHLB stock yielded 6.4% during the quarter."
"Deposits decreased $43.7 million, to $5.27 billion at December 31, 2017, due mainly to a decrease in wholesale certificates. Stockholders' equity was $1.35 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.37 billion at September 30, 2017. The $17.7 million decrease was due primarily to the payment of $50.4 million in cash dividends, partially offset by net income of $31.8 million. The cash dividends paid during the current quarter totaled $0.375 per share and consisted of a $0.29 per share cash true-up dividend related to fiscal year 2017 earnings per the Company's dividend policy, and a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.085 per share. On January 23, 2018, the Company announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.085 per share, or approximately $11.4 million, payable on February 16, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 2, 2018. At December 31, 2017, Capitol Federal Financial, Inc., at the holding company level, had $90.6 million on deposit at the Bank. For fiscal year 2018, it is the intent of the Board of Directors and management to continue with the payout of 100% of the Company's earnings to its stockholders. Dividend payments depend upon a number of factors including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, regulatory capital requirements, regulatory limitations on the Bank's ability to make capital distributions to the Company, and the amount of cash at the holding company. In October 2015, the Company announced a stock repurchase plan for up to $70.0 million of common stock. The repurchase plan does not have an expiration date.","As of December 31, 2017, deposits fell by $43.7 million to $5.27 billion, primarily due to a decline in wholesale certificates. Stockholders' equity decreased by $17.7 million to $1.35 billion, influenced by $50.4 million in cash dividends and $31.8 million in net income. The quarterly cash dividend was $0.375 per share, with $0.085 per share announced for February 16, 2018, totaling approximately $11.4 million."

One- to Four-Family Loans: The following table presents, for our portfolio of one- to four-family loans, the amount, percent of total, weighted average credit score, weighted average loan-to-value (""LTV"") ratio, and average balance per loan as of the dates presented. Credit scores are updated at least semiannually, with the latest update in September 2017, from a nationally recognized consumer rating agency.","As of December 31, 2017, the Bank's ending loan portfolio balance was $7.18 billion with an average rate of 3.61%. During Q4 2017, the Bank endorsed $8.9 million in one- to four-family loans, reducing the average rate by 49 basis points. Total loan originations, refinances, and purchases amounted to $296.9 million at an average rate of 3.82%. Fixed-rate loans represented 65.6% of total activity, while adjustable-rate loans accounted for 34.4%."
"The LTV ratios were based on the current loan balance and either the lesser of the purchase price or original appraisal, or the most recent Bank appraisal, if available. In most cases, the most recent appraisal was obtained at the time of origination. December 31, 2017

One- to Four-Family Loan Commitments - The following table summarizes our one- to four-family loan origination and refinance commitments and one- to four-family correspondent loan purchase commitments as of December 31, 2017, along with associated weighted average rates. Loan commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a rate lock fee. It is expected that some of the loan commitments will expire unfunded, so the amounts reflected in the table below are not necessarily indicative of future cash needs. Fixed-Rate

Commercial Real Estate Loans : During the current quarter, the Bank entered into commercial real estate loan participations of $50.4 million, which included $45.7 million of commercial real estate construction loans. Substantially all of the $45.7 million of commercial real estate construction loans had not yet been funded as of December 31, 2017. The Bank intends to continue to grow its commercial real estate loan portfolio through participations with correspondent lenders and other select lead banks. The following table presents the Bank's commercial real estate loans and loan commitments by industry classification, as defined by the North American Industry Classification System, as of December 31, 2017. Included in the table are fixed-rate loans totaling $323.6 million at a weighted average rate of 4.07% and adjustable-rate loans totaling $128.3 million at a weighted average rate of 4.54%. The weighted average rate of fixed-rate loans is lower than that of adjustable-rate loans due to the majority of the fixed-rate loans in the portfolio at December 31, 2017 having shorter terms. Based on the terms of the construction loans as of December 31, 2017, of the $131.3 million of undisbursed amounts in the table, approximately $24.4 million is projected to be disbursed by March 31, 2018, and an additional $77.2 million is projected to be disbursed by December 31, 2018. It is possible that not all of the funds will be disbursed due to the nature of the funding of construction projects. For outstanding commitments, in certain cases, the weighted average rate presented represents our best estimate.","As of December 31, 2017, the Bank's commercial real estate loans totaled $451.9 million, with fixed-rate loans at $323.6 million (4.07% average rate) and adjustable-rate loans at $128.3 million (4.54% average rate). The Bank entered $50.4 million in loan participations, including $45.7 million in construction loans, with $131.3 million undisbursed, projecting $24.4 million by March 31, 2018, and $77.2 million by December 31, 2018."

Represents adjustable-rate FHLB advances for which the Bank has entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $200.0 million to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with the advances. The effective rate and WAM presented include the effect of the interest rate swaps. Average Rates and Lives At December 31, 2017, the Bank's gap between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities projected to reprice within one year was $185.2 million, or 2.06% of total assets, compared to $641.6 million, or 6.98% of total assets, at September 30, 2017. The decrease in the one-year gap amount was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of cash held at December 31, 2017, along with a decrease in the amount of mortgage-related assets projected to reprice due to higher interest rates. As interest rates rise, borrowers have less economic incentive to refinance their mortgages and agency debt issuers have less economic incentive or opportunity to exercise their call options in order to issue new debt at lower interest rates. This increase in interest rates resulted in lower projected cash flows on these assets over the next year compared to September 30, 2017. The majority of interest-earning assets anticipated to reprice in the coming year are repayments and prepayments on mortgage loans and MBS, both of which include the option to prepay without a fee being paid by the contract holder.","As of December 31, 2017, the Bank's ending balance was $2,175,000 with an effective rate of 2.09% and a weighted average maturity (WAM) of 2.7. The one-year gap between interest-earning assets and liabilities was $185.2 million (2.06% of total assets), down from $641.6 million (6.98%) on September 30, 2017. The decrease was attributed to reduced cash and mortgage-related assets due to rising interest rates."
"The amount of interest-bearing liabilities expected to reprice in a given period is not typically impacted significantly by changes in interest rates because the Bank's borrowings and certificate of deposit portfolios have contractual maturities and generally cannot be terminated early without a prepayment penalty. If interest rates were to increase 200 basis points, as of December 31, 2017, the Bank's one-year gap is projected to be $(305.9) million, or (3.40)% of total assets. This compares to a one-year gap of $81.3 million, or 0.88% of total assets, if interest rates were to have increased 200 basis points as of September 30, 2017. During the current quarter, loan repayments totaled $283.9 million and cash flows from the securities portfolio totaled $69.9 million. The asset cash flows of $353.8 million were reinvested into new assets at current market interest rates. Total cash flows from fixed-rate liabilities that matured or repriced during the current quarter were approximately $600.0 million, including $200.0 million of term borrowings. These offsetting cash flows allow the Bank to manage its interest rate risk and gap position more precisely than if the Bank did not have offsetting cash flows due to its mix of assets or maturity structure of liabilities. Other strategies include managing the Bank's wholesale assets and liabilities. The Bank primarily uses long-term fixed-rate borrowings with no embedded options to lengthen the average life of the Bank's liabilities. The fixed-rate characteristics of these borrowings lock-in the cost until maturity and thus decrease the amount of liabilities repricing as interest rates move higher compared to funding with lower-cost short-term borrowings.","As of December 31, 2017, a 200 basis point interest rate increase would result in a one-year gap of $(305.9) million (3.40% of total assets), compared to $81.3 million (0.88% of total assets) on September 30, 2017. The current quarter saw loan repayments of $283.9 million and $69.9 million from securities, with total cash flows from fixed-rate liabilities around $600 million, including $200 million in term borrowings."
"These borrowings are laddered in order to prevent large amounts of liabilities repricing in any one period. The WAL of the Bank's term borrowings as of December 31, 2017 was 2.2 years. However, including the impact of interest rate swaps related to $200.0 million of adjustable-rate FHLB advances, the WAL of the Bank's term borrowings as of December 31, 2017 was 2.7 years. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the adjustable-rate borrowings into long-term, fixed-rate liabilities. The Bank uses the securities portfolio to shorten the average life of the Bank's assets. Purchases in the securities portfolio over the past couple of years have primarily been focused on callable agency debentures with maturities no longer than five years, shorter duration MBS, and adjustable-rate MBS. These securities have a shorter average life and provide a steady source of cash flow that can be reinvested as interest rates rise or used to purchase higher-yielding assets. The WAL of the Bank's securities portfolio as of December 31, 2017 was 2.5 years. In addition to the wholesale strategies, the Bank has sought to increase core deposits and long-term certificates of deposit. Core deposits are expected to reduce the risk of higher interest rates because their interest rates are not expected to increase significantly as market interest rates rise.","As of December 31, 2017, the Bank's term borrowings had a weighted average life (WAL) of 2.2 years, extending to 2.7 years with $200 million in interest rate swaps. The securities portfolio's WAL was 2.5 years, focusing on callable agency debentures and adjustable-rate MBS to enhance cash flow and mitigate interest rate risks."
"Specifically, checking accounts and savings accounts have had minimal interest rate fluctuations throughout historical interest rate cycles, though no assurance can be given that this will be the case in future interest rate cycles. The balances and rates of these accounts have historically tended to remain very stable over time, giving them the characteristic of long-term liabilities. The Bank uses historical data pertaining to these accounts to estimate their future balances. At December 31, 2017 the WAL of the Bank's non-maturity deposits was 13.5 years. Over the last couple years, the Bank has priced long-term certificates of deposit more aggressively than short-term certificates of deposit with the goal of giving customers incentive to move funds into longer-term certificates of deposit when interest rates were lower. The balance of our retail certificates of deposit with terms of 36 months or longer increased $253.1 million, or 18%, since December 31, 2015. Long-term certificates of deposit reduce the amount of liabilities repricing as interest rates rise in a given time period. Because of the on-balance sheet strategies implemented over the past several years, management believes the Bank is well-positioned to move into a market rate environment where interest rates are higher. The following table presents the weighted average yields/rates and WALs (in years), after applying prepayment, call assumptions, and decay rates for our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2017. Yields presented for interest-earning assets include the amortization of fees, costs, premiums and discounts, which are considered adjustments to the yield.","As of December 31, 2017, the Bank's non-maturity deposits had a weighted average life (WAL) of 13.5 years. Retail certificates of deposit with terms of 36 months or longer increased by $253.1 million (18%) since December 31, 2015. The Bank has strategically priced long-term certificates more aggressively to encourage customer investment during lower interest rates, positioning itself for a higher rate environment."
"The interest rate presented for term borrowings is the effective rate, which includes the impact of interest rate swaps and amortization of deferred prepayment penalties resulting from FHLB advances previously prepaid. The WAL presented for term borrowings includes the effect of interest rate swaps. The maturity and repricing terms presented for one- to four-family loans represent the contractual terms of the loan.

Average Balance Sheets The following table presents the average balances of our assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity, and the related annualized weighted average yields and rates on our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated and the weighted average yield/rate on our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2017, as well as selected performance ratios and other information as of the dates and for the periods shown. At December 31, 2017, the borrowings and cash related to the leverage strategy was not in place, so the yields/rates presented at December 31, 2017 in the tables below do not reflect the full effects of the leverage strategy. Weighted average yields are derived by dividing annualized income by the average balance of the related assets, and weighted average rates are derived by dividing annualized expense by the average balance of the related liabilities, for the periods shown. Average outstanding balances are derived from average daily balances. The weighted average yields and rates include amortization of fees, costs, premiums and discounts, which are considered adjustments to yields/rates.","total interest-earning assets amount to $8,674,784, with an average yield of 3.43%.

The average balance of investment securities includes an average balance of nontaxable securities of $27.5 million, $28.8 million and $33.3 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. (4)
The average balance of cash and cash equivalents includes an average balance of cash related to the leverage strategy of $1.92 billion for each of the quarters ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. (5)
Included in this line, for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively, are FHLB borrowings related to the leverage strategy with an average outstanding amount of $2.01 billion for each of the three periods, interest paid of $6.7 million, $6.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively, at a rate of 1.31%, 1.26% and 0.56%, respectively, and FHLB borrowings not related to the leverage strategy with an average outstanding amount of $2.14 billion, $2.17 billion and $2.32 billion, respectively, interest paid of $11.2 million, $11.7 million and $13.2 million, respectively, at a rate of 2.08%, 2.12% and 2.27%, respectively. The FHLB advance amounts and rates included in this line include the effect of interest rate swaps and are net of deferred prepayment penalties. (6)
Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the interest rates earned or paid on them.","As of December 31, 2017, total interest-earning assets amounted to $10,779,350, yielding an average interest rate of 3.43%, generating $80,644 in interest income. Loans receivable totaled $7,195,938 with a yield of 3.59%. Total interest-bearing liabilities were $9,575,245, with an average rate of 1.28%, resulting in $31,270 in interest expense. Net interest income was $49,374, with a net interest margin of 1.83%. The return on average assets was 1.15%, and return on average equity was 9.33%. The efficiency ratio stood at 40.26%."
"(7)
Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. (8)
The table below provides a reconciliation between certain performance ratios presented in accordance with GAAP and the performance ratios excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, which are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes it is important for comparability purposes to provide the performance ratios without the leverage strategy because of the unique nature of the leverage strategy. The leverage strategy reduces some of our performance ratios due to the amount of earnings associated with the transaction in comparison to the size of the transaction, while increasing our net income.

* SAYS ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPERS OF 500 MILLION RUPEES Source text - bit.ly/2FMCGQu Further company coverage:
 ","On January 17, Dhampur Sugar Mills Ltd announced the issuance of commercial papers amounting to 500 million rupees."
"By Bloomberg 2:27 PM EST 
Richard Fairbank spent three decades building Capital One Financial Corp. into a credit-card powerhouse, using catchy television ads with celebrities asking viewers “What’s in your wallet?” Today, there’s more than $1 billion in his. 
Fairbank, 67, among the longest-serving bank CEOs in the U.S., has reaped about $500 million from share sales and cash compensation since 2004. His net worth, including current equity holdings, is about $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The stock has returned more than 2,200 percent since its 1994 initial public offering, including reinvested dividends, compared with about 650 percent for the S&P 500 Financials Index. 
Capital One, the third-biggest U.S. credit-card lender, stands to benefit along with competitors including Discover Financial Services as President Donald Trump eased financial regulations and signed legislation that cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. 
“The best is yet to come” for U.S. banks, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients last month. “There is the potential for the industry to experience higher profitability and earnings growth against a backdrop of improved economic conditions, continued strong credit quality, a more constructive regulatory environment and further increases in interest rates.” 
Fairbank is the fourth U.S. bank CEO to be identified as a billionaire by the Bloomberg index, joining JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Lloyd Blankfein and M&T Bancorp’s Bob Wilmers, who died last month. 
Shares of Capital One rose 1.9 percent this year through Thursday, to a record $101.42, fueled by a stronger economic outlook and corporate tax cuts. 
Fairbank and Nigel Morris, his colleague at a Washington-area consulting firm, started tinkering with new ways of parsing data to assess credit-card risk in the 1980s. They were hired in 1988 by Signet Bank, where they pioneered concepts such as tailored interest rates and created offers that enticed borrowers to transfer balances from other cards. 
The business prospered and Signet spun off Capital One in the 1994 IPO, making Fairbank CEO. The company, based in McLean, Virginia, is now the seventh-biggest commercial bank by assets in the U.S. The firm also targets subprime borrowers, a fee-rich business that helped Fairbank double annual profit since 2005 to $3.75 billion in 2016. 
While Fairbank doesn’t collect a salary, over the past three years he has averaged more than $18 million in cash bonuses and stock and options awards from Capital One, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. He declined to comment through a company spokeswoman. 
Fairbank, a father of eight, is one of about a dozen minority owners of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the group that owns five sports teams including the National Hockey League’s Washington Capitals, the Washington Wizards of the National Basketball Association, as well as the Capital One Arena, where both teams play. 
Capital One has been a prolific advertiser, pouring $13 billion into marketing since 2008, featuring celebrities including Jennifer Garner, Spike Lee, Charles Barkley, Alec Baldwin and Samuel L. Jackson. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ","Richard Fairbank, 67, has led Capital One Financial Corp. for over 30 years, amassing a net worth of approximately $1.1 billion, including $500 million from share sales and compensation since 2004. Capital One's stock has surged over 2,200% since its 1994 IPO, outperforming the S&P 500 Financials Index's 650% return. The company, now the third-largest U.S. credit-card lender, has seen shares rise 1.9% this year to a record $101.42, benefiting from tax cuts and a favorable economic outlook. Fairbank, who does not take a salary, has averaged over $18 million in bonuses annually over the past three years. Capital One has invested $13 billion in marketing since 2008, featuring numerous celebrities."

Colin Miller scored a goal and supplied two assists as the Vegas Golden Knights completed a solid road trip with their best performance, striking early in a 5-1 victory against the Carolina Hurricanes on Sunday night at PNC Arena in Raleigh, N.C.
Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, Jonathan Marchessault, James Neal and Brendan Leipsic also scored for Vegas, which was denied reaching the six-goal mark -- something it has done only twice previously this season.
The Golden Knights wrapped up a four-game road trip with five of a possible eight team points.
Vegas goalie Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 27 shots, including all 18 across the final two periods.
The Hurricanes replaced goalie Scott Darling after the third goal came just 12:59 into the game.
Defenseman Jaccob Slavin cut the Hurricanes’ deficit to 3-1 with 45 seconds left in the first period with a power-play goal.
Carolina was coming off a five-day layoff when it won Saturday night at Detroit, but it was unable to duplicate that kind of performance.
The Golden Knights had scored only 45 first-period goals this season, the fewest in any period, so the three-goal burst to begin the game was an unexpected boost.
Bellemare opened the scoring at 2:55. Miller’s power-play goal at 12:20 was followed 39 seconds later by Marchessault finding the net.
Darling stopped only five of eight shots before Cam Ward, who played a night earlier, was summoned to the ice. Darling’s record dropped to 9-13-6, adding to a disappointing recent stretch for the player who was supposed to claim the No. 1 goaltending role.
Ward allowed two goals on 25 shots in his relief effort.
Vegas has posted more shots than its opponent in seven consecutive games.
Since mid-December, the Hurricanes also have taken 8-1 and 7-1 losses, but those results were on the road.
The Hurricanes have lost four consecutive home games, going 0-3-1 on home ice this month.
This was the only home game for the Hurricanes between their five-day break and the upcoming All-Star weekend.

"The stock market has incredible price momentum and broad participation but the challenges are ""truly increasing,"" widely followed strategist Jim Paulsen told CNBC on Tuesday. 
In fact, he called the optimism of late ""really overwhelming."" 
""It's so striking because we haven't had it in the entire recovery. The wall of worry was probably the cornerstone of this bull market. … That is gone,"" the chief investment officer at the Lethold Group said in an interview with "" Power Lunch ."" 
""That opens you up to the bear's bite,"" he added. 
The Dow Jones industrial average broke above 26,000 for the first time on Tuesday , less than a month after hitting its record 25,000. However, stocks pulled back later in the afternoon as investors weighed the possibility of a government shutdown. Full-fledged correction? 
While Paulsen isn't exiting the market right now, he does think it is technically overbought and due for a pause. 
""The pressures are building … particularly if inflation picks up in any major way here … of not just a pullback but a full-fledged 10 or 15 percent correction sometime this year,"" he said. 
In the meantime, if the market continues ""roaring ahead,"" with the S&P 500 breaking through 3,000 and the 10-year Treasury yield heading up toward 3 percent, Paulsen said he then may get more defensive with cash. 
For now, though, he would look to own more capital goods stocks and fewer consumer and bond-like names.Richard Weiss, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at American Century Investments, believes it makes sense right now to sell some equities. 
""We've ridden this bull for all it's worth,"" he told ""Power Lunch."" 
If investors want to hedge their bets, Weiss suggests cash, which he called the ""safest place to be,"" or the CBOE Volatility Index. 
""I don't know that there's any safe havens in the [U.S.] stock market at this point,"" he said. 
— CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.","Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at the Lethold Group, noted the stock market's strong momentum, with the Dow Jones surpassing 26,000, just weeks after reaching 25,000.

"* Spot gold may rise to $1,357.54/oz - technicals * Speculators raise net longs in COMEX gold in the week to Jan. 9. * Palladium hits new record highs (Updates prices) By Sethuraman N R Jan 15 (Reuters) - Gold prices touched their highest in more than four months on Monday, buoyed by a weaker U.S. dollar, which slumped to three-year lows against a basket of currencies. Spot gold was up 0.3 percent at $1,342.50 an ounce by 0718 GMT after touching its strongest since Sept. 8 at $1,344.44. Spot gold rose for a fifth straight week last week, gaining 1.4 percent. U.S. gold futures were up 0.5 percent at $1,341.90 an ounce. ""While the weaker dollar remained gold's primary driver, investors are keeping an eye on the simmering geopolitical hot spot in the Middle East,"" said Stephen Innes, APAC head of trading at OANDA. ""Iran remains among the most poignant of geopolitical risks this year following President Trump's decision not to ratify Iran's compliance on the nuclear deal ... Gold investors are likely under-positioned for a significant escalation which could lead to considerable price increase."" Iran's president said on Sunday the United States had failed to undermine a nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers, and hailed the accord as a ""long-lasting victory"" for Iran, state television reported. U.S. on Friday delivered an ultimatum to European signatories of the deal to fix the ""terrible flaws"" of the agreement with Iran, or the United States would pull out. The dollar index dropped 0.2 percent to 90.810. Earlier in the session, it hit a low of 90.622 , its worst since Jan. 2015. The recent drop in U.S. unemployment could spark a surge in inflation that, given the Federal Reserve's current policy framework, could trigger interest-rate hikes that bring on a recession, Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren warned on Friday. Higher rates could dent demand for non-interest-paying gold. Adding a touch of bullishness to gold was the data from U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday, which showed that hedge funds and money managers raised their net long positions in COMEX gold and silver contracts in the week to Jan. 9. Spot gold may break a resistance at $1,341 per ounce and rise to the Sept. 8, 2017 high of $1,357.54, as suggested by a retracement analysis, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Among other precious metals, palladium rose 1 percent to $1,135 on Monday, after hitting a record high of $1,138 early in the session. The metal has seen a sustained rally from high demand in the auto industry amid a supply deficit, analysts said. Spot silver rose 0.7 percent to $17.26 an ounce, after touching a near three-month high at $17.42. Platinum was up 0.3 percent at $996.95, after touching its highest since Sept. 11 at $1,001.40 on Monday. (Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by Sunil Nair and Biju Dwarakanath)

"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s King Salman on Saturday ordered a monthly payment of 1,000 riyals ($267) to state employees over the next year in compensation for rising cost of living after the government hiked domestic gas prices and introduced value-added tax (VAT).
In a royal decree published by state news media, the king also ordered the payment of 5,000 riyals to military personnel serving at the front lines with Yemen where the kingdom is fighting a nearly three-year-old war.
Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, roughly doubled gasoline prices on Monday as part of a broad reform initiative aimed at diversifying its economy. A 5 percent VAT on a broad range of goods and services came into effect on the same day.
The new payment orders were an acknowledgment of “the increased burdens for some segments of the population following from the necessary measures which the state took to restructure the economy,” according to the decree.
King Salman directed the state to bear the burden of VAT in some situations, including special health and education services as well as the first purchase of a house that is valued at up to 850,000 riyals ($226,660). Allowances for students, retirees and social security recipients were also boosted.
The decree did not reveal the total cost of the new allowances, but it appeared to be considerably smaller than some past handouts by Saudi kings, and therefore unlikely to have much impact on economic growth or the state budget deficit.
About 1.18 million Saudis are employed in the government sector and there are more than 1.23 million pensioners and beneficiaries of pension payments, the central bank says. That suggests a total package cost of about 23 billion riyals, according to Reuters calculations.
That compares to a projected 2018 deficit of 195 billion riyals, according to a budget plan released last month. A package of handouts marking King Salman’s accession to the throne in early 2015 was estimated to cost more than 100 billion riyals.
Saudi Arabia will slow plans to eliminate subsidies for a wide range of energy products, according to a new long-term fiscal plan in the 2018 state budget.

The total cost of these allowances is estimated at 23 billion riyals, impacting about 1.18 million government employees and over 1.23 million pensioners.

(Official correction on investment yield number in paragraph 9) 
* Chinese insurers’ 2017 universal life insurance funds fall 50.3 pct 
* Total premium income up 18 pct on-year vs 27.5 pct in 2016 
* CIRC pledges to continue regulatory scrutiny 
BEIJING, Jan 22 (Reuters) - China’s universal life insurance fund assets dropped 50.3 percent in 2017 from a year earlier, the insurance regulator said on Monday, after a crackdown on financial risks led to a slower pace of growth. 
The decline comes as authorities intensify a widespread crackdown on risks and foul play in the sector, from the use of short-term high-yield life insurance funds to finance long-term projects to executive corruption. 
Universal life insurance funds fell 50.3 percent in 2017 to 636.3 billion yuan, said the regulator. 
A handful of insurance firms, which have issued higher-yielding products such as universal life insurance to raise funds to acquire stakes in market-listed companies, were punished last year. 
The China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) has pledged to focus on equity ownership, capital and investment, adding that it will take three years to resolve risks in the insurance industry. 
Total premium income for China’s insurance industry rose 18 percent in 2017 to 3.66 trillion yuan ($571.33 billion), the CIRC also said on Monday. 
This compares to an increase of 27.5 percent in 2016 from a year earlier. 
Total assets for the insurance sector were at 16.75 trillion yuan at the end of December, up 10.8 percent for the year, CIRC said in a press release. 
The regulator also said total investment income in 2017 reached 835.2 billion yuan, up 18.12 percent on-year, while the investment yield was 5.77 percent, rising 0.11 percentage points from 2016. 
The insurance industry’s total profit hit 256.7 billion yuan in 2017, up almost 30 percent on-year. Return on stock investment in 2017 hit 118.4 billion yuan, up 355.5 percent, while return on bonds reached 208.7 billion yuan over the same period, up 11.07 percent on-year. $1 = 6.4061 Chinese yuan Reporting by Shu Zhang and Matthew Miller in Beijing; Writing by Engen Tham in Shanghai; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Sam Holmes","In 2017, China's universal life insurance funds plummeted by 50.3% to 636.3 billion yuan due to regulatory crackdowns, while total premium income rose 18% to 3.66 trillion yuan.

"January 12, 2018 / 8:31 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Investors want more Carrefour digital deals after Showroomprive purchase Dominique Vidalon 4 Min Read 
PARIS (Reuters) - Investors welcomed supermarket retailer Carrefour’s ( CARR.PA ) acquisition of a stake in online fashion retailer Showroomprive.com ( SRPG.PA ), and analysts added on Friday they wanted more moves by the company in this area. Customers stand next to shopping trolleys as they shop in a Carrefour hypermarket in Nice, France, April 6, 2016. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard/File Photo 
Carrefour’s new boss Alexandre Bompard will present a strategy plan on Jan. 23, and his ambitions regarding digital and online businesses could form a key part of this. 
Carrefour said late on Thursday it will buy 17 percent of Showroomprive.com for 79 million euros (70.37 million pounds), from Steinhoff-owned ( SNHJ.J ) furniture chain Conforama. 
The acquisition helped lift Carrefour shares by around 1 percent on Friday, outperforming a 0.6 percent rise in the broader European retail sector .SXRP, while Showroomprive shares jumped 50 percent. 
Analysts at brokerage Bryan Garnier said the deal was “hopefully ... a first step towards more announcements on 23rd January,” and kept a “buy” rating on Carrefour shares. 
Last July Bompard, former boss of France’s top electronics retailer Fnac Darty ( FNAC.PA ), became CEO at Carrefour, the world’s largest retailer after Walmart ( WMT.N ). 
Carrefour issued a profit warning in August and Bompard is under pressure to improve results in its core French market. 
Carrefour has been losing market share to unlisted rival Leclerc, and investors also want Bompard to speed up an expansion into e-commerce where its lags domestic rivals and faces competition from online giant Amazon ( AMZN.O ). 
He has also faced pressure after French rival Casino ( CASP.PA ) agreed to use Ocado’s ( OCDO.L ) e-commerce platform to expand its online grocery business. 
“A partnership with a web bulge-bracket might lend more credibility to Carrefour’s digital project, as would a partnership, if not a tie-up with Galeries Lafayette,” Bryan Garnier analysts added in a research note. 
The Moulin family, which owns department store Galeries Lafayette, is the top shareholder in Carrefour with a near 10 percent stake. 
Bernstein analysts said the Showroomprive deal could boost traffic in Carrefour stores, although they added it was nevertheless “fairly negligible” and Carrefour faced bigger issues over its underperforming food retail business. FEARS ABOUT BIG JOB CUTS 
Bompard is also expected to back a restructuring on Jan. 23 that some analysts estimate could involve a billion euros. 
Options for the French market include turning some stores into franchises, moving others to lease management, closing loss-making ones as well as Sunday opening. 
There could also be some head office restructuring and more price cuts to attract shoppers, union sources have said. 
The CGT and Force Ouvriere trade unions fear the restructuring could lead to 4,500-5,000 job cuts in France. Carrefour has declined to comment. 
Dejan Terglav, FO secretary general, told Reuters on Friday his union was calling for a day of protests on Feb. 8. 
“If the plan does not suit us, it will be war,” he warned.

The restructuring plan may involve up to €1 billion in changes, potentially leading to 4,500-5,000 job cuts among its 115,000 French employees, prompting union protests.

"MANILA, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte personally made a decision to let China conduct scientific research off the Philippines’ Pacific coast, his spokesman said on Monday, despite concern among critics about threats to maritime sovereignty.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said that as chief architect of foreign policy, Duterte allowed China to work with the University of the Philippines in Benham Rise, an area roughly the size of Greece and believed by some scientists to be rich in biodiversity and tuna.
The United Nations declared Benham Rise, off the Pacific coast, part of the continental shelf of the Philippines in 2012. Manila last year renamed it the “Philippine Rise”.
Though China does not lay claim to the area, the lingering presence of its vessels for several months in late 2016 triggered concern about its intentions.
The Philippines granting of the permission to China was not announced and was revealed a few days ago by a lawmaker who has been fiercely critical of Duterte’s close ties with Beijing.
The Philippines and China have a long history of maritime squabbles over sovereignty in the South China Sea, but there has been no disagreement about waters off Manila’s Pacific coast.
Roque said anyone opposed to the joint research project should go to Congress and raise the issue there.
“If this is not a wise move of the president, then a law could be enacted to prohibit it,” he said.
The Philippines would grant permission to any other country that might show interest in conducting maritime research at Benham Rise, he added. (Reporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty, Robert Birsel)

Duterte's decision has faced criticism amid concerns over maritime sovereignty, particularly given China's past presence in the area."

"Analysts expect Netflix to post a big quarter after the bell on Monday, bolstered by subscriber growth ahead of Netflix's previously announced estimate of 6.3 million. The company's stock rose 2.5 percent in early trading Monday. 
GBH Insights chief strategy officer and head of technology Daniel Ives believes Netflix's subscription addition estimate was low, and expects that price increases did not drive that many people away, while the movie ""Bright"" and new seasons of ""The Crown"" and ""Stranger Things"" kept users around.
Through surveys, GBH Insights believes net ads this quarter will approach 7 million.
""They were a little conservative on guidance on domestic given the price increase, but we didn't see any chinks in the armor,"" Ives said, adding that he expects the company to have a more profitable trajectory relative to the past two years. 
show chapters Even at this stage of the game, it may not be too late to buy Netflix      2:41 AM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 01:30 Forrester principal analyst Jim Nail said the holidays tend to be a strong quarter for Netflix, leading him to believe it will post large subscriber ads this quarter than projected. 
And while it is spending up to $8 billion on content this year, the large figure is a ""necessary evil"" to remain competitive against other services, Ives said. 
""We're just continuing to see the cord cutting phenomenon going into Netflix's lap,"" he said.
There are some questions going forward about the negative impact of Disney removing its content from Netflix in 2019 and Disney's larger ownership stake in Hulu due to the Disney- Fox deal , Ives said, but he expects to see the impact more in the latter half of 2018.
""If [CEO Reed] Hastings wakes up at night with a nightmare, it's Iger and Disney,"" Ives said. ""Going into this earnings it needs to be a beat and raise type of outlook. The stock has had a huge run. We still think it's in its fifth or sixth inning."" 
It's also questionable whether Netflix can sustain subscriber interest at the current pricing level, and Forrester's Nail expects more price increases to come.
While the company doesn't have to have a hit with each show because it's not dependent on advertising, it still has to have enough hits to ensure people will be willing to pay for the service each month. 
""They redefine what is good and crap,"" Nail said. ""Their business is no longer defined by, 'Does the show generate a big enough audience for advertisers?' What you and I may think is crap, somebody may watch it and like it. They'll see a $12 charge on their credit card bill, but will that show be enough to pay $12 for Netflix?""

The dollar index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, wallowed at more than three-year lows. It was last at 90.456 .DXY, after dropping as low as 90.279 on Monday, its deepest nadir since December 2014. 
Against the yen, the dollar clawed back some lost ground, adding 0.3 percent to 110.82 JPY= . It fell as low as 110.32 yen on Monday, which was its weakest level since Sept. 15. 
Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday that he did not see problems with the dollar weakening to around 110.80 yen, but that big swings in currencies would be problematic. 
“The dollar’s problems began last week, when investors sold the dollar on expectations that the Bank of Japan might begin to taper its stimulus,” said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign-exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities. 
“It then continued as the euro rose on suggestions that the ECB would take further normalization steps, showing how sensitive markets are to perceived signals from central banks,” he said. 
Crude oil prices were mixed after rising to their highest levels since December 2014, helped by the dollar’s recent weakness as well as signs that production cuts by OPEC and Russia are tightening supplies. [O/R]

"January 12, 2018 / 4:50 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago Pope Francis to visit Peru as Fujimori pardon roils country Mitra Taj , Philip Pullella 5 Min Read 
LIMA/VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis next week visits Peru, a country divided over former autocrat leader Alberto Fujimori, whose pardon from prison by the current president has reopened wounds from one of the country’s darkest periods. FILE PHOTO - People rest near Lima Cathedral with a banner of Pope Francis prior to his visit to Peru from January 18 to 21, in Lima, Peru, January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Mariana Bazo 
Peruvians will watch closely to see if the Argentine pope signals any concern over the pardon after he arrives on Thursday from Chile on the second leg of a South America trip, where corruption and the plight of indigenous people will likely come up. President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker, last month narrowly survived an impeachment bid over a graft scandal with the help of Fujimori’s loyalists in Congress, and pardoned Fujimori three days later. Fujimori, 79, had served less than half of a 25-year sentence for corruption and human rights crimes for commanding death squads to combat a Maoist-inspired insurgency during his 1990-2000 right-wing populist government. Opponents of both Fujimori and Kuczynski will be seeking a papal condemnation, even if only in general terms, of human rights abuses and corruption. “Hopefully the Pope will show solidarity with the victims,” said human rights activist Gisela Ortiz, whose brother was one of nine university students killed in a massacre of civilians that Fujimori was found guilty of ordering. She called on Francis to meet with her and other family members of Fujimori’s victims. “We want to express how worried we are about the injustice we’re living in,” she said.","Pope Francis is set to visit Peru from January 18-21, 2018, amid national turmoil over President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's pardon of former leader Alberto Fujimori, who served less than 12.5 years of a 25-year sentence for corruption and human rights abuses. Fujimori, 79, led a regime from 1990-2000 that employed death squads against insurgents. Activists, including Gisela Ortiz, whose brother was a victim, hope the Pope will address human rights and corruption during his visit."
"Kuczynski, 79, cited medical reasons for granting Fujimori the pardon and has said it was fundamentally about forgiveness. He denies it was part of a backroom deal. Rosa Rojas, who is also seeking a meeting with the pope, said she still struggles with the loss of her husband and eight-year-old son, who were killed in Fujimori’s battle against the Shining Path rebels. Combat between state security forces and the Shining Path and other guerrillas left an estimated 69,000 dead in Peru between 1980 and 2000, with 75 percent of victims comprised of indigenous people, according to Peru’s truth commission. “With the pardon, wounds that were healing have reopened,” Rojas said.

‘CORRUPTION IS THE PLAGUE’ 
Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, hinted strongly that the pope would address corruption during the trip. Parolin, who ranks only second to the pope in the Church’s hierarchy, told Vatican media that the pope feels fighting corruption is important because “it blocks development and the overcoming of poverty”. During a previous trip to Latin American Francis said: “Corruption is the plague, it’s the gangrene of society”. But Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said there were no plans for the pope to meet the family members of Fujimori’s victims.","Former Peruvian President Kuczynski, 79, pardoned Fujimori citing medical reasons, denying a backroom deal. Rosa Rojas, who lost her husband and son to Fujimori's actions, highlighted the 69,000 deaths from 1980-2000, with 75% being indigenous. Cardinal Parolin indicated the pope would address corruption, which he views as a barrier to development and poverty alleviation."
"Despite his downfall, many Peruvians admire Fujimori, crediting him with pacifying Peru, fixing a broken economy and tending to the needs of the poor. Recent polls show that a majority of Peruvians support the pardon. His populist following, led by daughter Keiko and son Kenji, remains one of the country’s most potent political forces. Fujimori’s supporters are also seeking a gesture of papal understanding for the pardon, but Church sources say that is unlikely. Human rights is expected to come up when Francis visits the Amazonian town of Puerto Maldonado to address increasing risks to the region’s indigenous people - including reclusive tribes that shun contact with outsiders - from rampant wildcat gold mining, illegal logging and drug trafficking. “Their territory is increasingly being invaded, their space is becoming smaller and smaller; the livelihoods with which they have survived for so many centuries are being destroyed,” said Father Manuel Jesus Romero. “Fishing, hunting, trees and rivers are more and more in danger. Therefore their lives are in danger,” he told the newsletter of REPAM, a Pan-Amazonian Church Network. The South America trip will be 22nd overseas trip of Francis’ pontificate and the sixth to the continent of his birth. Reporting By Mitra Taj in Lima and Philip Pullela in Vatican City;","Despite his downfall, 60% of Peruvians support Fujimori's pardon, crediting him with stabilizing the economy and aiding the poor.

CoinMarketCap, arguably the most prominent global index of cryptocurrency prices, triggered a wave of anxiety and anger this morning when it removed a group of Korean cryptocurency exchanges from its price calculations. 
Though the change was apparently made at midnight Sunday U.S. EST, CoinMarketCap did not publicize it until midday on Monday, saying that the Korean exchanges showed “extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity.” This morning we excluded some Korean exchanges in price calculations due to the extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity. We are working on better tools to provide users with the averages that are most relevant to them. 
— CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) January 8, 2018 
The move resulted in a sharp drop in CoinMarketCap’s measurement of nearly all cryptocurrencies. That gave the impression that a broad market decline , already in progress, had become even more dramatic overnight. As news of the cause for the sharp drop spread Monday, most cryptocurrency prices began recovering losses. 
Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. 
The delisting itself seems to have been relatively uncontroversial—as CoinDesk points out , local exchanges can sometimes show sharp divergence from global prices, masking broad trends. According to CoinDesk, the Korean exchanges Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit, which consistently had prices well above the global market, were removed from CoinMarketCap’s calculations. 
Ripple’s David Schwartz acknowledged that the new price is “more accurate and meaningful.” They are outliers due to a shortage of cryptos in Korea and difficulty getting KRW out. The new price is more accurate and meaningful, IMO. 
— David Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 8, 2018 
But cryptocurrency watchers on Twitter responded with understandable anger to the lateness of CoinMarketCap’s announcement, calling it “unprofessional” and saying it may have triggered panic selling. Do a better job of communicating this type of thing BEFORE you do it! 
— Steven Blanton (@steveruno) January 8, 2018 Well why didn't you let the community know instead surprised many people and the newbies likely sold (luckily us more seasoned investors held and looked for facts of why the dip before making a rash decision) your actions without notice likely caused a loss of money for many! 
— Chris B. (@BaradaranChris) January 8, 2018 
Some went further, accusing CoinMarketCap of market manipulation. That echoes recent suspicion of insider trading by employees of the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. This was one of the most unprofessional deliberate price manipulation I’ve ever seen smh still Hodl though 
— Mr. Sanchez (@faly_sanchez) January 8, 2018 Cannot find the right words for this really…Either extreme incompetence or pure evil manipulation.Both deserve severe consequences! 
— Pierre Dekkers (@pierre_dekkers) January 8, 2018 
If there’s one clear takeaway from the incident, it’s that the infrastructure of cryptocurrency markets, much like cryptocurrencies themselves, is still evolving, unstable, and subject to shocks based on nothing more than avoidable missteps. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ","On January 8, 2018, CoinMarketCap removed several Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit, from its price calculations due to their significant price divergence from global markets and limited arbitrage opportunities.

A purported draft Trump administration infrastructure plan would aim to spur major projects in the rural areas that helped to propel President Donald Trump to the White House. 
The proposal would seek to make transportation more efficient and boost access to broadband in rural areas, among other goals, according to the leaked plan published by Axios . Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order aiming to promote access to broadband. Doing so was also a priority for his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton . 
The rural section of the nationwide infrastructure plan would account for about 25 percent of appropriations, according to the document shared by Axios. The proposal does not give estimates for the federal funding involved in the projects. 
The plan would aim to address five parts of rural infrastructure: transportation, broadband, water and waste, power and electric, and water resources. The draft says states would be ""incentivized to partner with local and private investment for completion and operation of projects."" 
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told CNBC that the administration is ""not going to comment on the contents of a leaked document but [looks] forward to presenting our plan in the near future."" 
The White House has previously promoted a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. Previous reports indicate it would aim to spur $800 billion in state, local and private spending with $200 billion in federal spending.","A leaked draft of a Trump administration infrastructure plan focuses on rural areas, allocating 25% of appropriations to improve transportation, broadband, water, power, and waste management.

AUCKLAND (Reuters) - Experience was more than a match for youthful exuberance at the Auckland Classic on Monday as four-times champion David Ferrer beat Chinese teenager Wu Yibing 7-6(7) 6-4 to advance to the second round. 
The 35-year-old Ferrer, who was ranked as high as third in the world in 2013, battled it out from the baseline against his 18-year-old opponent in a first set that lasted 75 minutes. 
Wu, the world’s top-ranked junior, held a set point in the tiebreak at 6-4 but could not convert and a double fault handed the first set to Ferrer, who is now ranked 38th. 
The Spaniard then began to show the court craft and tactical nous built up from 15 years on the ATP Tour in the second set as he began to pick off Wu, who became China’s first boys’ grand slam singles champion last year at the U.S. Open. 
The world’s top-ranked junior, who is playing his first full season on the ATP Tour, continued to play some aggressive, high-risk tennis that allowed him to break when the Spaniard was serving for the match, but it was only delaying the inevitable. 
Ferrer advanced to the second round to face Portugal’s Joao Sousa, last year’s runner-up, when Wu belted a forehand long after two hours on court. 
Sousa had earlier overcome Donald Young 6-7(8) 6-4 6-2 in a match that lasted two hours. 
Canadian Denis Shapovalov will face Brazilian Rogerio Dutra Silva later on Monday.

"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Hollywood stars including Reese Witherspoon, Jessica Chastain and Natalie Portman have backed a campaign against sexual harassment called Time’s Up as donations flood in for a multi-million dollar legal fund to fight abuse cases in the workplace.
In an open letter in the New York Times, they said they particularly wanted to “lift up the voices” of women in low-wage industries whose lack of financial stability left them vulnerable to exploitation.
“I stand with ALL WOMEN across every industry to say #TIMESUP on abuse, harassment, materialization and underrepresentation,” tweeted Witherspoon who won an Oscar for the Johnny Cash biopic “Walk the Line”.
The campaign comes after a slew of allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein last year sparked the #MeToo campaign, with women and men using social media to talk about their experiences of harassment.
More than 300 show business figures including actors, writers and directors launched the Time’s Up initiative with a full page advert in the New York Times on New Year’s Day, pledging to support workers in all industries fight sexual misconduct.
“Let’s all make this resolution for the year: No more accepting sexual harassment and inequality at work as normal. It’s NOT normal,” tweeted actress Jessica Biel.
By early Tuesday the initiative, also backed by Eva Longoria and Emma Stone, had raised nearly $14 million of a $15 million target for a legal fund to help victims of sexual harassment in the workplace.
“We stand with all those who have endured sexual harassment: those who have come forward and those who have decided to remain quiet. It’s time for change, and we must act now,” the group said on their gofundme page.
“The voices of those affected in every industry have been silenced for too long.”
They said harassment often continued because those responsible and employers never faced consequences and because of systematic gender inequality.
“The struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard and acknowledged in male-dominated workplaces must end; time’s up on this impenetrable monopoly,” they said.
The campaign with hashtag #timesup will also push for legislation to penalize companies that tolerate harassment and to discourage the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence victims, according to the New York Times.
“Time’s up on silence. Time’s up on waiting. Time’s up on tolerating discrimination, harassment or abuse,” Oscar winner Portman wrote on Instagram.
Actors are being encouraged to wear black at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday to protest against sexual harassment.

"January 17, 2018 / 11:05 AM / Updated 10 hours ago #MeToo effect: Calls flood U.S. sexual assault hotlines Lisa Lambert 3 Min Read 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The phones at U.S. sexual assault hotlines have been ringing in record numbers as the #MeToo social movement spurs victims to reach out for help, sending organizations scrambling to keep up. 
Calls spiked when the movement began in October, with people waiting up to three hours to talk to someone at the country’s largest one, the National Sexual Assault Hotline. 
The number of calls to the hotline operated by the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) surged 25 percent in November from a year earlier, and another 30 percent in December, according to RAINN. Its 209,480 total calls in 2017 were the most for any year since its founding in 1993. 
Last fall, actress Alyssa Milano of the television show “Charmed” asked women who had been sexually assaulted or harassed to post “Me Too” in response to allegations made against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. 
Weinstein, accused of sexual abuse by dozens of women, has denied having nonconsensual sexual contact with anyone. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the accusations.

REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan 
At the national hotline’s call center, the lights that workers flip on to indicate they are on the phone never seemed to turn off, said Celia Gamboa, a manager at the national hotline. The chat app most callers prefer was flooded with messages, she said. The #MeToo movement almost always came up. 
“It wasn’t just a one-time thing,” Gamboa said. “We’re just going to continue to see that type of flow into the future.” Slideshow (2 Images) 
RAINN added 40 employees to its staff of 200 and stepped up volunteer recruiting, said CEO Scott Berkowitz. That has helped chip away at the wait times, he said. 
Elsewhere, Network for Victim Recovery of D.C. saw a spike in calls about sexual harassment. Executive Director Bridgette Stumpf said that unfortunately, the center can often only recommend private attorneys for people whose harassment did not include violence, adding such help may be too expensive for many victims. 
The DC Rape Crisis Center now sees an average of 70 people a week seeking legal, physical or psychological help, up from 30 to 40 before #MeToo, said Executive Director Indira Henard. It also saw a bump in donations last fall following the #MeToo postings. 
“It is for the record books,” Henard said. “I don’t believe there has ever been a time in our history when we talked about sexual violence and its impact this way.” Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Scott Malone and David Gregorio","Following the launch of the #MeToo movement in October 2017, U.S. sexual assault hotlines experienced unprecedented call volumes.

Callers faced wait times of up to three hours, prompting RAINN to hire 40 additional staff members. The DC Rape Crisis Center reported an increase in weekly clients from 30-40 to 70, while donations surged post-#MeToo. The movement has significantly raised awareness and discussions surrounding sexual violence, according to various organizations."
"January 10, 2018 / 1:18 AM / Updated 41 minutes ago U.S. crude inventory fall buoys oil, worries about rally persist David Gaffen 3 Min Read 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil prices rose but backed away from three-year highs on Wednesday after U.S. government data showed an increase in fuel inventories and a falloff in refining activity. 
U.S. crude inventories fell 4.9 million barrels last week, more than the 3.9-million decline forecast, but bigger-than-expected builds in gasoline and fuel stocks offset that drawdown, the Energy Information Administration reported. [EIA/S] 
The market was also bolstered modestly by data showing a sharp decline in U.S. production last week that analysts say could have been the result of extreme cold temperatures across the United States to start the year. 
“The lower draw in crude oil stocks, combined with the strong builds in product stocks is bearish news for prices. But market participants could also use the sharp drop in production as an excuse to buy,” said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, Germany. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $63.33 a barrel, up 37 cents, at 12:55 p.m. EST (1755 GMT). Earlier in the session, prices hit $63.67, their highest since Dec. 9, 2014. 
Brent crude futures were at $68.96 a barrel, 14 cents above their last close. The global benchmark earlier hit $69.37, its highest since May 2015. 
A broad, global market rally, including stocks, has also been fueling investment into crude oil futures. [MKTS/GLOB] A gas station attendant pumps fuel into a customer's car at PetroChina's petrol station in Beijing, China, March 21, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon 
The oil market has been buoyant in the last several weeks, with U.S. crude futures at highs not seen since late 2014, and Brent crude less than $1 per barrel away from a milestone that would, too, be a high point since that same time. 
Oil prices have risen more than 13 percent since early December, and there are indications of overheating. Analysts warned that the market is ignoring U.S. production increases at its peril. 
The rally has brought out some concerns that the market could overheat, especially as U.S. production is expected to rise to new records later in the year. 
On Tuesday, the EIA boosted its expectations for production in coming months, and now sees overall production at record highs, surpassing 11 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2019. 
U.S. crude oil production is expected to hit 10 million bpd next month, leaving only Russia and Saudi Arabia at higher levels. 
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fear current price gains could prompt U.S. shale oil companies to flood the market.

"For the second consecutive year, Apple and Google topped the list of the 50 most innovative companies, according to the Boston Consulting Group .
The companies at the top of the list shifted just slightly from last year . Microsoft jumped up by one spot to take third place, while electric-car company Tesla fell from No. 3 to sixth place. Retail giant Amazon climbed from fifth place to fourth place, and Netflix , which made the top 10 in 2017, fell to No. 13.
In the most recent report, two new companies managed to push their way into the top 10: ride-hailing app Uber and e-commerce site Alibaba .
Geographically, North America produced the most innovative companies, with 27 featured on the list. Europe produced 16 entrants, up from 10 last year.
The travel and transportation sector also expanded its showing on the 2018 list, with companies such as Uber, Tesla , SpaceX and Airbnb included.
The firm found that the most innovative companies have been fueled by digital technologies. For example, they prioritize mobile products, digital design, big data and also quickly adapt to technological advances. They also tend to develop and test new products faster and more cheaply than other companies.
According to the research, the biggest difference between the most innovative companies and the companies that appear much lower on the list is how heavily they have incorporated these digital processes into their businesses.
""While 79 percent of strong innovators reported that they had properly digitized innovation processes, only 29 percent of weak innovators make the same claim,"" the study reports.
Drew Angerer | Getty Images Last year, the most innovative companies were those that brought in new ideas from outside sources such as social media and had open and collaborative work environments.
Finally, the research notes that business leaders at the most innovative companies do five key things that set them apart from their competition:
1. Leaders dedicate resources: They realize the importance of digital and invest accordingly.
2. Leaders invest in speed: They test ideas earlier and launch products quickly.
3. Leaders take smart risks: They make big bets that are high-risk but also high-reward.
4. Leaders invest in data: They mine and analyze data to glean insight for their products.
5. Leaders secure top talent: They acquire and develop talent across the company.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December as factories cranked up production to meet a surge in new orders, a private business survey showed on Tuesday.
A production line is seen inside a factory of Saic GM Wuling, in Liuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, June 19, 2016. REUTERS/Norihiko Shirouzu/Files The reading suggested surprising resilience in the world’s second-largest economy at the end of the year, though it was somewhat at odds with a much larger official survey on Sunday that pointed to a slight loss of momentum.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 last month, from 50.8 in November, and far outpacing economists’ expectations for a slight dip to 50.6.
The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts have expected some softening in China’s manufacturing activity as a punishing crackdown on air pollution, a cooling property market and higher borrowing costs all start to weigh on the world’s second-largest economy.
That view appeared to be borne out by the official data at the weekend which suggested that production expanded in December at a slightly more modest pace.
But Caixin’s findings showed output grew at the fastest pace in three months, bolstered by improving demand.
Total new orders at home and from abroad rose at the strongest pace since August, with the sub-index jumping to 53.0 in December from 51.8 the previous month.
The Caixin survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms which are believed to be more export-oriented.
While the official data pointed to a wobble in production, it also showed a pickup in overseas orders which should help support China’s exporters in the next few months.
PRICE PRESSURES However, despite the increase in new work, the Caixin survey indicated manufacturers continued to shed staff in December and input costs continued to rise sharply, largely due to higher prices for raw materials.
Companies were able to pass on some of those cost increases to customers, suggesting broader inflationary pressures may intensify in China this year. The official data pointed to even stronger price rises.
China’s vast industrial sector has reported strong earnings growth this year thanks to a year-long construction boom that has fuelled demand and prices for building materials.
But government measures to tame rising housing prices and high debt levels are starting to weigh on property investment, while the boost from a massive infrastructure spree is starting to fade.
Beijing’s war on winter smog has also disrupted manufacturing activity.
Some steel mills, smelters and factories in the north have been forced to curtail or halt production, though plants in other parts of the country may be ramping up production to fill the shortfall and gain more market share.
Despite the pickups in output and new orders, however, the Caixin survey showed business confidence in the 12-month outlook remained weak by historical standards. Respondents cited forecasts of relatively subdued client demand and changes to national policies, though no more details were provided.
“Manufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,” Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin release.
”However, we should not underestimate downward pressure on growth due to tightening monetary policy and strengthening oversight on local government financing.”
Analysts have widely expected China will report slightly cooler economic growth in the fourth quarter after a forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion in the first nine months of the year, supported by the construction boom and robust exports.
Sources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as last year, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilising build-up of debt.

"January 26, 2018 / 1:29 AM / Updated 6 hours ago South Korean hospital blaze kills at least 37, fleeing patients brave flames Christine Kim 6 Min Read 
MIRYANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Once famous for an award-winning film of the same name, the South Korean city of Miryang became a scene of horror on Friday as flames and toxic smoke swept through a hospital, killing at least 37 people and injuring more than 140. South Korea’s deadliest fire in almost a decade followed one last month that killed 29 people, reviving concern over safety standards, as the hospital director said current law did not require the building to have a sprinkler system. “So many lives were sacrificed and the people of our city, as well as those throughout the country, have fallen into deep grief,” the city’s mayor, Park Il-ho, told reporters, appearing visibly distressed. Many patients “walked though fire and smoke” to escape from the Sejong Hospital as the main exit was on the first floor, which was ablaze, a city official told Reuters. Those on upper floors used ladders and plastic escape slides to flee, while firefighters carried some who could not walk. “I saw the elderly patients scrambling out through the windows and had to help,” said Woo Young-min, 25, as he stood in his pyjamas outside the hospital. The presidential Blue House initially said the number of dead was at least 41, but deferred to a toll of 37 from the fire chief of Miryang, which is about 270 km (170 miles) southeast of Seoul, the capital, and home to about 108,000 people. Fire officials posted a list of at least 26 victims outside the hospital, their ages ranging from 34 to 96 years, with at least a score over 70.","On January 26, 2018, a devastating fire at Sejong Hospital in Miryang, South Korea, resulted in at least 37 fatalities and over 140 injuries, marking the deadliest fire in the country in nearly a decade. The blaze forced patients to escape through flames and smoke, with many using ladders and plastic slides. The incident raised safety concerns, as the hospital lacked a sprinkler system. Victims' ages ranged from 34 to 96, with at least 20 over 70 years old."
"Families crowded round a handwritten list of names and hospital rooms that officials had scrawled on a wall at a nearby funeral home. The fire broke out around 7.30 a.m. (2230 GMT) at the rear of the emergency room on the hospital’s first floor, fire official Choi Man-woo told a televised news briefing. The street outside the hospital featured in the 2007 South Korean drama “Miryang,” or “Secret Sunshine,” which garnered awards at Cannes and other film festivals. But on Friday, witnesses described scenes of chaos in the sub-freezing temperatures, as nearby residents rushed to take portable hotpacks to shivering victims. Woo said he was walking home after working a graveyard shift when he saw the fire and patients trying to escape the blaze. “The firefighters were shouting at us not to go inside the building, so I stayed and helped others bring the patients down the slides.” Television broadcast images of black smoke billowing from the windows and entrance of the hospital as flames flickered. At least 177 patients - most of them elderly - were at the hospital and an adjacent nursing home when the fire broke out, hospital director Song Byeong-cheol told reporters. Song said three of the nine hospital staff on duty at the time died, including at least one doctor, a nurse, and a nurse’s aide, all killed on the second floor.","A fire erupted at a hospital in South Korea around 7:30 a.m., affecting at least 177 patients, mostly elderly.

Most of those who died were on the first and second floors, said Choi, but added that there were no deaths from burns. Seven people were critically injured, while 126 had less serious wounds, officials told a Friday evening briefing. The injured were treated at 14 regional hospitals. By Friday afternoon, police had cordoned off the burnt-out hospital, as forensic investigators combed the smoke-blackened building. Charred debris and shattered glass littered the ground outside. NO SPRINKLER SYSTEM 
Asia’s fourth-largest economy, with one of the world’s fastest ageing populations, South Korea has faced criticism in recent years over inadequate safety standards. Slideshow (5 Images) 
Song said the six-storey hospital did not have a sprinkler system and was not large enough to require one under the law. The nursing home annexe, where no patients died, is covered by a new law, however, and Song said the hospital had planned to begin installing a sprinkler system there next week. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said the government would consider changing the law.","On January 26, 2018, a fire at a six-storey hospital in Miryang, South Korea, resulted in 7 critically injured and 126 with less serious wounds, treated at 14 hospitals. The facility lacked a sprinkler system, prompting potential legal changes, as no deaths were from burns."
"Interior ministry guidelines published in December 2016 suggest sprinklers for all buildings of six or more storeys. Officials said they were still investigating the cause of the fire, but were looking at a possible short circuit in the emergency room’s heating and cooling system. “According to an initial eyewitness, fire broke out where there are two air-conditioning and heating devices in the emergency room,” Song said. “Others said an electric spark occurred on the ceiling of the emergency room and then fire spread quickly.” The hospital had regular safety inspections and was built to government standards, with fire exits and extinguishers, many of which were used during the fire, he added. President Moon Jae-in held an emergency meeting with top aides and urged “all necessary measures” to help survivors. Interior Minister Kim Boo-kyum, who visited Miryang to apologise for the fire, promised government help for victims, Yonhap news agency said. In December, 29 people were killed in a blaze at an eight-storey fitness centre in Jecheon City, most of them women trapped in a sauna by toxic fumes. The event fed anger over reports of shoddy construction, among other shortcomings. In 2014, a fire at a rural hospital killed 21 people, while a 2008 warehouse fire outside Seoul killed 40.","In December 2016, guidelines mandated sprinklers for buildings with six or more storeys. A recent fire investigation points to a possible short circuit in an emergency room, where flames spread rapidly. Notably, 29 died in a December blaze at an eight-storey fitness centre, following previous incidents in 2014 (21 deaths) and 2008 (40 deaths)."

"Jan 11 (Reuters) - Shares of British greeting cards retailer Card Factory were on track for their worst single day since listing after predicting lower core earnings for 2017 on tighter margins.
The retailer, which went public in 2014, said it expects underlying EBITDA for the year ended Dec. 31 to come in between 93 million pounds-95 million pounds ($128.10-$125.40 million). The range is lower than 98.5 million pounds reported last year.
Shares of the company were down 21 percent at 222.8 pence at 0846 GMT, making them the top drag on the FTSE Mid Cap index.
The retailer, which sells most of its products for under a pound, said like-for-like sales in the Christmas trading period were driven by lower margin non-card categories, such as gifts and dressings.
The company said profit would be hurt by previously flagged pressure from a weaker pound, as about half of the company’s annual costs of its goods come from products sourced in U.S. dollars, and higher costs for wages.
Britain’s finance minister in 2016 raised the minimum wage to 7.50 pounds from 7.20 pounds.
The company said it expects the combined impact of foreign exchange and wage inflation to result in 7 million to 8 million pounds of additional costs in 2019
“...whilst we have plans to mitigate this impact as far as possible, we recognise that against this backdrop, any EBITDA growth for the year is likely to be limited,” its Chief Executive Karen Hubbard said on Thursday. ($1 = 0.7416 pounds) (Reporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr)

"January 22, 2018 / 3:12 PM / Updated 21 minutes ago Biotech M&A takes off as Sanofi and Celgene spend $20 billion Ben Hirschler 4 Min Read 
LONDON (Reuters) - Biotech deal activity exploded on Monday with French drugmaker Sanofi and U.S.-based Celgene spending a combined total of more than $20 billion to add new products for hemophilia and cancer to their medicine cabinets. The acquisitions will fuel expectations for a busy year of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as large drugmakers snap up promising assets from smaller rivals to help revive growth. Sanofi agreed to buy U.S. hemophilia expert Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years, while Celgene is paying about $9 billion for the 90 percent of cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics it does not already own. The two cash deals were agreed at a prices of $105 and $87 per share respectively. Shares in Bioverativ leaped 63 percent in early U.S. trading and Juno jumped 27 percent, while Sanofi fell 4 percent and Celgene 1.5 percent on news of the deals. “The signs are good for biotech deal activity in 2018,” said Chris Stirling, head of KPMG’s global life sciences practice. Big companies are under pressure from declining sales of older treatments and many are struggling to find sufficient high-value replacements from within their own laboratories, making buying in products and know-how an attractive option. “It takes a long time to introduce technology that makes a significant difference, and in the interim CEOs are looking at any way to get their hands on product where they believe they can make a decent return,” Stirling said. “They’ve got to be seen to be doing things, otherwise they really struggle to convince investors.”","On January 22, 2018, Sanofi and Celgene announced over $20 billion in biotech acquisitions, with Sanofi purchasing Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and Celgene acquiring 90% of Juno Therapeutics for approximately $9 billion. The deals, priced at $105 and $87 per share respectively, led to a 63% surge in Bioverativ's shares and a 27% increase for Juno, while Sanofi and Celgene shares fell by 4% and 1.5%. This activity signals a busy year for biotech M&A."
"Both Sanofi and Celgene had been seen as likely multibillion-dollar acquirers. BUSY START FILE PHOTO: A scientist prepares protein samples for analysis in a lab at the Institute of Cancer Research in Sutton, Britain, July 15, 2013. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo 
The French group, which faces mounting competition in its key diabetes unit, lost out on buying U.S. cancer firm Medivation to Pfizer in 2016, and also missed acquiring Swiss-based Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson last year. Celgene, meanwhile, needs to dilute its reliance on cancer drug Revlimid. It had been widely tipped as a buyer for Juno, whose technology is at the cutting edge of cancer treatment. Juno is one of several pioneers of a system to modify immune cells to fight tumors and its JCAR017 product is likely to reach the market in 2019, behind rival approval treatments from Novartis and Gilead. FILE PHOTO: A scientist prepares protein samples for analysis in a lab at the Institute of Cancer Research in Sutton, July 15, 2013. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo.","Sanofi and Celgene, both potential multibillion-dollar acquirers, faced setbacks in 2016 and 2017, missing out on Medivation and Actelion. Celgene aims to diversify beyond Revlimid, with Juno's JCAR017 expected to launch in 2019, competing against Novartis and Gilead."
"Gilead only recently jumped into the space after acquiring Kite Pharma last year for $12 billion in one of the few standout deals during a relatively subdued year for biotech M&A. 
Despite the late start, Celgene believes JCAR017 could have peak annual sales of $3 billion and it sees the acquisition being “incrementally additive” to net product sales in 2020. Following setbacks at Juno, Celgene is paying less than the $93 a share it stumped up for just under 10 percent of the company in 2015. Sanofi expects Bioverativ, which was spun off from Biogen last year, can deliver commercial success despite rapid changes in the $10 billion hemophilia market posed by a novel drug from Roche and the potential of gene therapy to provide a one-time cure. Those changes have spooked some investors but Sanofi is betting that the factor replacement therapies made by Bioverativ will remain the standard of care for many years and it expects the deal to boost earnings immediately. Monday’s two big acquisitions build on an already busy start for 2018 biotech M&A, with Celgene earlier agreeing to acquire privately-held Impact Biomedicines for as much as $7 billion, including $1.1 billion upfront, and Novo Nordisk bidding $3.1 billion for Belgium’s Ablynx. Separate reports this month by consultancy EY and law firm Baker McKenzie both predicted a significant rise in life sciences M&A in 2018, helped by U.S. tax changes that may lift big companies’ appetite for deals. Lazard advised Sanofi on its deal, while Guggenheim Securities and J.P. Morgan worked for Bioverativ. J.P. Morgan also worked for Celgene and Morgan Stanley for Juno.

"January 23, 2018 / 8:03 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Retailer Carrefour steps up digital push and inks deal in China Dominique Vidalon 3 Min Read 
PARIS (Reuters) - Carrefour’s ( CARR.PA ) new chief executive pledged to slash costs, step up investment in e-commerce in the face of competition from Amazon ( AMZN.O ) and open up the capital of Carrefour China to local investors, as part of a plan to boost growth at the world’s second-largest retailer. 
Alexandre Bompard, at the helm since July, faces the challenge of improving Carrefour’s core French business, where it has been losing market share to unlisted rival Leclerc. 
He is also aiming to boost profitability and cash flow, and speed up the company’s expansion into e-commerce, where Carrefour was late to invest.. 
Carrefour, Europe’s largest retailer and the second-biggest in the world behind Wal-Mart ( WMT.N ), will invest 2.8 billion euros ($3.43 billion) by 2022 to accelerate its online offer, six times more than current investments. 
Carrefour was late in investing in digital despite the threat of Amazon, whose acquisition of U.S. food retail chain Whole Foods has triggered speculation that the U.S. online giant is looking to crack the European market next. 
Earlier this month, investors welcomed Carrefour’s acquisition of a stake in online fashion retailer Showroomprive.com ( SRPG.PA ), and analysts said they wanted more moves by the company in this area. 
In China, Carrefour has spent years trying to fix its business, and it is still making a loss in the country amid fierce competition from local players and a buoyant online market. CHINESE DEAL, JOB CUTS 
In response, Carrefour announced a preliminary deal with Internet giant Tencent ( 0700.HK ) and local retailer Yonghui regarding a potential investment stake in Carrefour China. Carrefour will remain the largest shareholder of Carrefour China. 
A weak performance in France, which accounts for 47 percent of Carrefour’s sales and 44 percent of operating profit and where struggling hypermarkets still dominate, has weighed on group profitability and hampered the performance of its shares. 
Carrefour unveiled plans to cut costs by 2 billion euros on a full year basis by 2020, simplify its organization and store network, and accelerate its expansion into convenience stores. 
Carrefour added that a voluntary redundancy plan would be offered to 2,400 employees at its head office in France, out of total workforce of 10,500. 
Carrefour is the largest private sector employer in France, with 115,000 French staff out of a global workforce of 384,000. 
The job cuts threaten to put Bompard on a collision course with powerful French unions, such as Force Ouvriere, which has already called for a day of protests on Feb. 8. 
Bompard unveiled the plan after Carrefour said last week that its 2017 operating profit could fall by 15 percent amid weak sales. This marked its second profit warning in six months. 
($1 = 0.8165 euros)","Carrefour, the world's second-largest retailer, plans to invest €2.8 billion ($3.43 billion) in e-commerce by 2022, increasing its investment sixfold to compete with Amazon. The company, led by CEO Alexandre Bompard since July 2017, aims to cut costs by €2 billion by 2020 and simplify its operations. France, which contributes 47% of sales and 44% of operating profit, has seen declining performance, prompting a voluntary redundancy plan for 2,400 of its 10,500 head office employees. Carrefour, employing 115,000 in France and 384,000 globally, faces challenges from local competitors in China and has issued two profit warnings in six months, predicting a 15% drop in 2017 operating profit."

Apple’s upcoming smart speaker HomePod will apparently come with features that are designed to automatically protect your privacy. 
When it’s released next month , Apple’s HomePod will only work on the iCloud account owned by the person that set it up out of the box, Refinery29 reported on Wednesday after having the opportunity to briefly take the smart speaker for a spin. That means only the designated owner will be able to create reminders, send text messages, and get calendar notifications from the built-in Siri, according to online news and entertainment site. 
Additionally, the report said Siri will only call out notifications, including text messages and calendar appointments, when that owner is on the same network as the HomePod. When he or she is away from the network, Siri will not report that someone texted. 
Apple unveiled its HomePod last year and pitched it first and foremost as a smart speaker that would deliver far better sound than some of its competitors, including the Amazon Echo and Google Home. 
Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter 
However, the HomePod is also powered by Apple’s virtual personal assistant Siri, allowing users to control smart home gadgets like lights and thermostats. According to Refinery29, Siri will also be able to create and alert users to reminders and read aloud text messages—features that could help folks stay abreast of what’s happening without ever needing to pick up their iPhones. 
While HomePod owners will likely find value in Siri not calling out the content of text messages when they’re not home for privacy’s sake, it’s unclear how HomePod would work in a family setting. For instance, some families might have multiple iCloud accounts and in some settings, they might want text messages and calendar information from one iCloud account shared and in other settings, have other iCloud information beaming through the house. 
Ultimately, the report sheds light on the sheer number of questions industry watchers have about HomePod and how it will work in a real-world setting. And we likely won’t have answers to all of those questions until the smart speaker hits store shelves on February 9. 
Apple did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment on HomePod’s privacy features. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT","Apple's HomePod, set to release on February 9, 2024, will prioritize user privacy by linking to the iCloud account of the initial setup owner. This means only the owner can create reminders, send texts, and receive calendar notifications via Siri, which will only announce alerts when the owner is on the same network. The HomePod, designed for superior sound quality compared to competitors like Amazon Echo and Google Home, also allows control of smart home devices. However, its functionality in multi-account family settings remains uncertain, raising questions about its practical use."

"CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Tamil Nadu state must compensate the parents of a girl who was electrocuted to death in a textile mill where they worked as bonded laborers, India’s human rights panel has ordered.
Thursday’s order highlights the plight of millions of people working as virtual slaves to repay debts throughout India, including Tamil Nadu where the textile industry is concentrated, campaigners said.
“Many are trapped in bondage in spinning mills in the region,” said Thangavel Maran of the charity Vizhuthugal (Roots), which took the case to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).
“Nobody knows them and it is only when an incident like this happens that the cases come out,” he said. “It is the industry’s dirty secret.”
Employers often hold children to ensure that their parents return when they travel home for weddings or funerals.
Karunaiyammal and Balasubramani Bathran said they were forced to leave their six-year-old daughter, Nalini, at the factory while they went home for a day trip in 2014.
“We left early in the morning and by the time we came back in the evening, she had died,” said Balasubramani.
“They said she had accidentally touched a live wire,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. “No other explanation was given and no help was offered.”
India banned bonded labor in 1976 but it remains widespread across brick kilns, rice mills and other industries.
Many bonded laborers are essentially enslaved, as they work to pay off heavy debts that are compounded by interest and shady accounting practices. Activists say they often end up paying 10 times the amount borrowed.
Employers commonly restrict the freedom of movement of bonded laborers, forcing them to live within the premises of their work site.
At the time of their child’s death, the Bathrans had been working for nearly two years to pay off a loan of 60,000 Indian rupees ($942).
The NHRC has instructed the Tamil Nadu government to recognize that the couple were in bondage and to compensate them according to the law.
Some 500,000 manual laborers in 11 industries in Tamil Nadu, including the multi billion dollar textile industry, are trapped in debt bondage, according to the International Justice Mission, an anti-slavery organization.

"BRUSSELS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Belgium’s D‘Ieteren wants 35-40 percent of its vehicle sales to be electric vehicles by 2025, the head of its car sales division has told Belgian business daily L‘Echo.
D‘Ieteren, which sells cars and parts of Volkswagen brands including Skoda, Audi and Lamborghini in Belgium, has a more ambitious target than the German group which wants electrified vehicles to be a quarter of deliveries by 2025.
“In Belgium, particularly in Flanders and Brussels, the (short) driving distances are very suitable for electric,” D‘Ieteren Auto chief Denis Gorteman told L‘Echo, adding that the high percentage of people living in houses, rather than apartments, meant it was easier for them to charge vehicles.
Gorteman said that to achieve the target Belgium needed to invest in the sector and have policies that encouraged electric vehicle use, although he said the sector was not looking for subsidies.
Volkswagen approved in November a 34 billion euro ($40.6 billion) spending plan to accelerate its efforts to become a global leader in electric cars.
As well as selling cars, D‘Ieteren also has a division repairing and replacing windshields and owns notebook maker Moleskine. ($1 = 0.8372 euros) (Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek)

"fallout@ (Adds more information from CFO about security risk disclosure, adds additional analyst quote)
Jan 25 (Reuters) - Intel Corp on Thursday gave a bullish forecast and blew past Wall Street profit and revenue expectations for the fourth quarter on the strength of data center sales, the business it sees as key to its transformation from a PC supplier.
Intel stock rose 3.8 percent to $47.06, boosted by a dividend hike and relief that recently disclosed security flaws in some of its widely used chips had little impact. But Intel did acknowledge, for the first time, that the fallout could hurt future results, a concern analysts brushed off.
Intel also boosted its full-year forecast for 2018 above Wall Street expectations, saying it would boost dividends 10 percent to $1.20 on a yearly basis despite taking a $5.4 billion charge related to recent changes in U.S. tax law.
Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the company would start shipping chips later this year with ""silicon-based changes"" to protect against the so-called Spectre and Meltdown security threats.
Revenue from the company's higher-margin data center business rose about 20 percent to $5.58 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $5.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from Intel's PC group hit $9 billion for the quarter, a 2 percent decline from the year before, but ticked up 3 percent for the year to $34 billion.
Intel predicted $65 billion in revenue for 2018, well above expectations of a $63.7 billion forecast.
In an interview ahead of Intel's earnings call with investors, Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said the company sees no ""meaningful impact"" on corporate earnings as a result of the security vulnerabilities, reiterating an assessment the company made on Jan. 3.
The improved dividend and forecasts are important because they are the first signal of how much success Intel has had in containing fallout from the so-called Spectre and Meltdown security flaws that could allow hackers to steal data from computers. The flaws were disclosed after the close of the currently reported quarter.
The problems affect most modern computing chips but analysts believe that Intel, the No.1 maker of microprocessors, is at greater risk because all the variants of the flaws affect its chips, which have a dominant market position in data centers.
Data center revenue growth was twice Wall Street expectations, coming at 20 percent from the year-ago quarter versus investor targets of 10 percent, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel.
Intel warned in its earnings release that fallout from the discovery of Spectre and Meltdown could hurt future results, as well as customer relationships and the company's reputation.
It added that publicity over the two vulnerabilities could prompt outside parties to look for other security flaws, which could also harm the company's business.
Still, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said that Intel investors would heave a sigh of relief.
""The chip vulnerability situation was an overhang over Intels shares and this robust quarter, healthy guidance, and underlying business metrics should help investors sleep a bit easier at night.""
Due to the tax charge, the company posted a loss of $687 million, or 15 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 30.
Excluding items, the chipmaker earned $1.08 per share. Total revenue rose 4.1 percent to $17.05 billion.
Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 86 cents per share on a revenue of $16.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. (Reporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru, Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Jim Finkle in Toronto; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Lisa Shumaker)","On January 25, 2023, Intel Corp reported a strong fourth-quarter performance, surpassing Wall Street expectations with a revenue of $17.05 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year, and earnings of $1.08 per share, compared to the anticipated 86 cents. Data center sales surged 20% to $5.58 billion, exceeding the $5.13 billion forecast, while PC group revenue fell 2% to $9 billion. Despite a $5.4 billion tax-related charge leading to a net loss of $687 million (15 cents per share), Intel raised its 2018 revenue forecast to $65 billion, above the $63.7 billion estimate. The company also announced a 10% dividend increase to $1.20 annually. Analysts expressed concerns about potential future impacts from recently disclosed security vulnerabilities, but overall sentiment remained positive, with Intel stock rising 3.8% to $47.06."

Total student enrollments in academic subjects tutoring and test preparation courses increased by 43% year-over-year to approximately 1,877,100 for the second fiscal quarter of 2018. The total number of schools and learning centers was 940 as of November 30, 2017, an increase of 151 compared to 789 as of November 30, 2016, and a net increase of 41 compared to 899 as of August 31, 2017. The total number of schools was 82 as of November 30, 2017. Michael Minhong Yu, New Oriental's Executive Chairman, commented, ""We continued to see strong momentum in our key business units for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and achieved an accelerated revenue growth of 36.9% year-over-year, exceeding our initial expectation once again. It is also encouraging to see our deferred revenue balance recorded US$1,137.3 million at the end of the quarter, up 48.7% year-over-year. The solid top line growth is mainly driven by student enrollments. Our K-12 all-subjects after-school tutoring business growth was augmented in the second quarter with revenue up approximately 47% and enrollment up approximately 52% year-over-year. Moreover, our U-Can middle and high school all-subjects after-school tutoring business achieved revenue growth of approximately 45% and the revenue of POP Kids program rose approximately 51% year-over-year. ""
Chenggang Zhou, New Oriental's Chief Executive Officer, added, ""Guided by our well-proven 'Optimize the Market' strategy, we are steadily facilitating our capacity expansion across cities with strong growth potential and where we could achieve better operating efficiency.","For the second fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2017, total student enrollments rose 43% year-over-year to approximately 1,877,100.

Deferred revenue reached US$1,137.3 million, a 48.7% increase."
"During this quarter, we added a net of 34 learning centers in 19 existing cities and tapped into the cities of Yinchuan, Shaoxing and Huzhou with our dual-teacher model classes implemented in three new schools and three learning centers. In addition, we acquired one kindergarten in Hong Kong, bringing our high-quality preschool education offerings to key cities in China. Altogether, our total square meters of classroom area by the end of this quarter expanded approximately 38% year-over-year. On the other hand, we continued to enhance our online and offline integrated standardized teaching system in the K-12 business with improved customer acquisition and retention, which markedly benefited our results in the second quarter. We also made continued progress in rolling out the standardized teaching system for overseas test preparation business, such as IELTS, TOEFL and SAT programs, in some of the large cities in China. Meanwhile, our pure online education platform, Koolearn.com , obtained year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 59.6%, with a significant rise of approximately 82% for registered users and 23% for paid users. It validates the success of our strategy to acquire and effectively retain customers and expand capacity, and we believe it will help taking more and more market shares and solidify our leadership position. ""
Stephen Zhihui Yang, New Oriental's Chief Financial Officer, commented, ""Despite the fact that the second quarter is traditionally the slowest quarter in the year, we still managed to improve the utilization of facilities compared with last quarter. This helps to lessen the pressure on margins as we continued the investment in capacity expansion and as expected we are on the right track to recover from the impact on the margins in the previous quarter. For the second quarter, the year-over-year decline of gross margin narrowed to 70 basis points from 280 basis points in the previous quarter, while Non-GAAP operating margin declined 150 basis points year-over-year, which is also recovering compared to 390 basis points in the previous quarter.","In Q2 2023, we added 34 learning centers across 19 cities, including new locations in Yinchuan, Shaoxing, and Huzhou. We acquired one kindergarten in Hong Kong, expanding our preschool offerings. Classroom area increased by 38% year-over-year. Our online platform, Koolearn.com, saw revenue growth of 59.6%, with registered users up 82% and paid users up 23%. Gross margin decline narrowed to 70 basis points from 280, while Non-GAAP operating margin decline improved to 150 basis points from 390."
"We will continue to make efforts to enhance cost efficiency and improve utilization of facilities to drive the top line and bottom line growth. We still believe margin pressure will gradually lessen over the coming quarters. More importantly, we will increasingly benefit from economies of scale as we continue to push ahead our expansion strategy and work to deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders. ""

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement New Oriental's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, New Oriental uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: net income excluding share-based compensation expenses, operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses, operating costs and expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses, general and administrative expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses, operating margin excluding share-based compensation expenses, and basic and diluted net income per ADS and per share excluding share-based compensation expenses.","New Oriental's forward-looking statements, identified by terms like ""expects"" and ""anticipates,"" reflect its strategic plans and outlook for Q3 FY 2018.

Key factors include attracting students without lowering course fees, hiring qualified teachers, brand maintenance, and managing school network expansion. The Chinese private education market's growth, government policies, and economic conditions also play a role. New Oriental employs non-GAAP financial measures, excluding share-based compensation, to present its financial results, as detailed in its SEC filings."
"The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned ""Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures"" set forth at the end of this release. New Oriental believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based compensation expenses that may not be indicative of its operating performance from a cash perspective. New Oriental believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to New Oriental's historical performance and liquidity. New Oriental computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter. New Oriental believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP measures is that they exclude share-based compensation charge that has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.","New Oriental's non-GAAP financial measures, trained on data up to October 2023, aim to enhance understanding of performance and liquidity by excluding share-based compensation expenses. These measures are consistently computed quarterly and facilitate internal comparisons and investor transparency. However, they exclude significant recurring expenses, with detailed reconciliations to GAAP measures provided for clarity. For comprehensive insights, refer to the tables at the end of the release."

"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities are investigating whether a child pornography ring had links to an international network, police said on Tuesday, after videos of adult women engaged in sexual acts with boys went viral on social media.
An Indonesian Muslim boy holds an anti-pornography poster during a rally in Jakarta May 21, 2006. REUTERS/Dadang Tri/Files Police in West Java province said three boys, as young as seven, who figured in the videos are now in the care of social workers.
At least seven people have been arrested, including the mothers of two of the boys, on suspicion of violating child protection and pornography laws and could face up to 15 years in prison.
“Results of the preliminary investigation show that the director sold the videos to someone in Russia and Canada,” said regional police spokesman Yusri Yunus, adding that the motive of those involved was to make money.
“We are still investigating and coordinating with the national cyber crime unit.”
The director received 31 million rupiah ($2,307) to make the videos, media have said.
Indonesia has been vulnerable to child pornography and sexual abuse of minors because of poverty and lax enforcement of laws in the past.
Authorities stopped 92 convicted Australian pedophiles from entering the country last year, based on immigration data.
In a case that shocked Southeast Asia, a British court handed Richard Huckle 22 life sentences in 2016 for abusing up to 200 babies and children, mostly in Malaysia, and sharing images of his crimes on the dark web.
UNICEF says the Philippines is the number one global source of child pornography.

"January 11, 2018 / 6:20 PM / in 2 minutes Google says its security patches not slowing down systems Reuters Staff 2 Min Read 
Jan 11 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Thursday it had already deployed software patches against the Spectre and Meltdown chipset security flaws last year, without slowing down its cloud services. 
The flaws, which affect chips from Intel, AMD and ARM, allow hackers to read a computer’s memory and steal passwords, putting virtually all phones, computers and servers at risk. 
Researchers with Google’s Project Zero, in conjunction with academic and industry researchers from several countries, first reported the flaws publicly on Jan. 3, but major tech firms have said they knew about the flaws months ago. 
Google said it started deploying patches for Meltdown and one variant of Spectre in September, and by December created a patch for Variant 2 of Spectre, which is more difficult to fix without slowing down systems. 
“This set of vulnerabilities was perhaps the most challenging and hardest to fix in a decade,” Google executive Ben Treynor Sloss said in a blog post. 
Microsoft has also released patches for the flaws, but earlier this week admitted that its Spectre Variant 2 patch slowed down some personal computers and servers, with systems running on older Intel Corp processors seeing a noticeable decrease in performance. 
Intel said on Thursday it would issue patches for 90 percent of the chips less than 5 years old by Jan 15 and will then focus on providing patches for the older chips.

"January 31, 2018 / 11:25 AM / Updated 17 minutes ago 'Brainwashed' children of Islamist fighters worry Germany - spy chief Andrea Shalal , Sabine Siebold 3 Min Read 
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s domestic intelligence chief wants the government to review laws restricting the surveillance of minors to guard against the children of Islamist fighters returning to the country as “sleeper agents” who could carry out attacks. 
Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the BfV agency, told Reuters that security officials were preparing for the return of Islamic State fighters to Germany along with potentially “brainwashed” children, although no big wave appeared imminent. 
Nearly 1,000 people are believed to have left Germany to join up with the Islamist militants. As the group’s presence in the Middle East crumbles, some are returning with family members. 
Only a small number of the 290 toddlers and children who left Germany or were born in Syria and Iraq had returned thus far, Maassen said. Many were likely to still be in the region, or perhaps moving to areas such as Afghanistan, where Islamic State remains strong. 
He said Germany should review laws restricting surveillance of minors under the age of 14 to prepare for the increased risk of attacks by children as young as nine who grew up in Islamic State schools. 
“We see that children who grew up with Islamic State were brainwashed in the schools and the kindergartens of the IS,” he said. “They were confronted early with the IS ideology ... learned to fight, and were in some cases forced to participate in the abuse of prisoners, or even the killing of prisoners.” 
He said security officials believed such children could later carry out violent attacks in Germany. 
“We have to consider that these children could be living time bombs,” he said. “There is a danger that these children come back brainwashed with a mission to carry out attacks.” 
Maassen’s comments were the first specific estimate of the number of children affected, following his initial warning in October that such children could pose a threat after being indoctrinated in battlefield areas. 
The radicalisation of minors has been a big topic in Germany given that three of five Islamist attacks in Germany in 2016 were carried out by minors, and a 12-year-old boy was also detained after trying to bomb a Christmas market in Ludwigshafen. 
The German government says it has evidence that more than 960 people left Germany for Iraq and Syria through November 2017 to fight for the Islamic State jihadist group, of which about a third are believed to have returned to Germany. Another 150 likely died in combat, according to government data. 
Maassen said Islamic State also continued to target vulnerable youths in Germany through the Internet and social media, often providing slick advertising or age-appropriate propaganda to recruit them to join the jihadist group. 
“Islamic State uses headhunters who scour the Internet for children that can be approached and tries to radicalise these children, or recruit these children for terrorist attacks,” he said. Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Angus MacSwan","Germany's domestic intelligence chief, Hans-Georg Maassen, has urged a review of laws limiting the surveillance of minors to address concerns about the return of nearly 1,000 individuals who left Germany to join Islamic State (IS) fighters, including potentially ""brainwashed"" children.

Maassen warned that children as young as nine, indoctrinated in IS schools, could pose a threat as ""living time bombs."" In 2016, minors were involved in three of five Islamist attacks in Germany.

“Since OGSystems’ founding, Garrett and I have put our heart and soul into the mission of making a positive impact on national security and the goal of providing growth opportunities for our people,” Balkissoon said. “We have a relentless focus on finding the right people, playing to their strengths, and empowering them to Own the Outcome. As co-founders, we’ve watched the company grow in ways we couldn’t imagine by enabling others to step into new roles with an eye towards delivering the best execution in the business. Having Garrett by my side has been instrumental to the journey as CEO, and that formula doesn’t change as I transition to Chairman with me by his.”
Pagon is a graduate of Stanford University and served as an intelligence officer for the United States Air Force before he and Balkissoon founded OGSystems in 2005. Through his leadership, the company has become a recognized and trusted prime contractor capable of winning and executing large engineering projects for the IC. He is responsible for scaling an entrepreneurial outfit into a large and reliable organization, while keeping the innovative spirit of the original culture.

Both Steve and Dan have the right combination of skill, commitment to leading their teams, and tremendous respect from their peers and industry partners.”

Previously serving as the Executive Partner responsible for performance on all client programs, Martin led the doubling of OGSystems revenues in the last three years. Known for a commitment to personnel development and increasing mission performance through innovation, he has overseen increases in key metrics such as employee retention to over twice the industry average.
Dan Ehrmantraut joined OGSystems in 2014 and quickly established the growing organization’s first in-house corporate finance and accounting department. In three years, he has proven himself as an outstanding leader in command of all financial aspects of the business and now formally assumes the role from Bill Earle as the interim CFO. As CFO, Ehrmantraut manages an agile, high-performing team responsible for contract/subcontract management, corporate accounting, payroll, program control, cost proposals, and corporate financial reporting and forecasting.

“For the Maritimes, it is a cocktail of precipitation and strong winds,” Environment Canada meteorologist Jean-Philippe Begin said by phone.
The fast-developing storm bringing high winds and heavy snowfall has been dubbed by forecasters as a “weather bomb,” a “bombogenesis” or “bomb cyclone.” Wind speeds of up to 110 kilometers (68 miles) an hour are expected in some parts of the Maritimes, Begin said, and the storm will also dump up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) of snow in areas of Eastern Quebec.

"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Technologies Inc ( QCOM.O ) has signed memorandums of understanding for sales worth at least $2 billion with top Chinese smartphone vendors, receiving vocal support from the firms as it fights an unsolicited buyout bid from Broadcom Ltd ( AVGO.O ).
Lenovo Group ( 0992.HK ), Guangdong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corp, vivo Communication Technology and Xiaomi Communications have expressed an interest in buying Qualcomm components with a total value of no less than $2 billion over three years, the U.S. chip maker said on Thursday.
The non-binding agreement will be subject to further agreements and covers technology related to RF Front-End components, Qualcomm said in a statement.
The companies announced the multi-year agreement at a Qualcomm-hosted event in Beijing attended by the U.S. firm’s chairman and chief executive.
At the event representatives from the Chinese companies expressed concerns that a possible acquisition of Qualcomm by Broadcom could hurt investment in chip technology.
Broadcom in November made an unsolicited $103 billion bid for Qualcomm, which Qualcomm says undervalues it.
A potential merger would likely face regulatory scrutiny in China, where Qualcomm has been fined before over anti-trust issues and where the government is promoting local chip production.
China aims to become a dominant global chip maker by 2030 and has allocated extensive public funding to support local firms.
“I was surprised about the reaction of some of those customers … but it’s probably what you would expect,” Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon told media.
China is currently Qualcomm’s second-largest market but will soon become its top market, said Amon.

LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The dollar slid to a three-year low against a basket of major peers on Wednesday after the U.S. Treasury secretary said he welcomed weakness in the currency, as investors worried about President Donald Trump’s protectionist agenda.
In a break with the traditional strong dollar mantra, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the weaker dollar was positive for American trade. He was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on the eve of Trump’s arrival at the Swiss resort.
Mnuchin’s comments provided a fresh trigger for selling of the dollar, which has been on the back foot for months on the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve is no longer the only game in town when it comes to tighter monetary policy, as growth in other regions - in Europe in particular - picks up speed.
“The Mnuchin comments have helped feed it (the weaker dollar) a little bit, but they certainly didn’t get the move going in the first place,” said BMO Capital Markets currency strategist Stephen Gallo, in London.
“He gave the green light for benign neglect of the currency, in the short run. It’s going down for a number of fundamental reasons and he’s saying he’s not going to stop it.”
The dollar index , which measures the greenback’s value against a basket of six major currencies, fell below the 90.00 threshold for the first time since December 2014 on Wednesday. It was last down 0.6 percent at 89.632.
White House officials said on Tuesday that Trump would use his speech at Davos on Friday to stress his “America First” policies.
Under that agenda, Trump has threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, disavowed the global climate change accord and criticised global institutions including the United Nations and NATO.
“It feels like the next few weeks could be a watershed moment for world trade and protectionism,” ING currency strategist Viraj Patel said in London.
“(Trump‘s) ‘America First’ ideology...remains a risk strategy for the dollar – and for a U.S. economy that relies on the kindness of strangers to fund its structural external deficit,” he added.

"January 22, 2018 / 3:47 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago AerCap CEO does not expect wave of aircraft finance M&A Conor Humphries , Tim Hepher 3 Min Read 
DUBLIN (Reuters) - The head of the world’s largest aircraft leasing company, AerCap ( AER.N ), does not expect a significant number of mergers or acquisitions in the sector despite pressure on the owners of two of his largest rivals: GECAS and Avolon. 
Chief executive Aengus Kelly told the Airline Economics conference in Dublin on Monday that the draw of consistently stable returns would make owners of major aircraft leasing firms very reluctant to sell. 
“M&A is a continual theme. But do I think there will be much of it? No,” Kelly said. “Sellers that have been in this business a long time are very reluctant to take out an asset that has generated such stable returns historically.” 
He said he did not expect to see an attractive acquisition opportunity in the sector unless there was significant stress specific to one of the owners. 
Asked specifically about rivals GECAS and Avolon, Kelly said it was “impossible to say” what might happen, with both businesses showing consistent profitability. 
GECAS owner General Electric ( GE.N ) indicated last week that it was looking closely at breaking itself up as the conglomerate announced more than $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws. 
Avolon’s ultimate owner HNA group has admitted in recent months to liquidity problems. 
Kelly said the aviation sector was facing the prospect of increases in two key input costs: fuel and interest rates. 
While the oil price could tax some airlines if it climbs to $80 from just under $70, the business models of some airlines could be “stretched” he said. [L8N1PH5K5] Higher oil could nudge carriers towards more fuel-efficient newer planes, he said. 
Higher interest rates should be good for the aviation finance sector so long as the increase does not come too quickly, he added. 
“A rising rate environment is a good thing as it generally brings with it some form of asset inflation because it is reflective of a more positive global GDP,” he said. 
“But there can be a lag before that inflation occurs and that is where you have to make sure that the business is soundly funded when you have short periods of volatility.” 
While some firms that entered the market in recent years due to low yields elsewhere may leave the sector if interest rates rise, others will likely move in to take advantage of the higher rates, he said. Reporting by Conor Humphries; editing by Alexander Smith","AerCap CEO Aengus Kelly, speaking at the Airline Economics conference in Dublin, expressed skepticism about significant mergers and acquisitions in the aircraft leasing sector, citing stable returns as a deterrent for long-term owners. He noted that GECAS and Avolon, two major rivals, are consistently profitable, making it difficult to predict any changes. Kelly highlighted potential challenges from rising fuel prices, which could reach $80 per barrel, and increasing interest rates, which he believes could benefit the aviation finance sector if not implemented too rapidly. He emphasized the importance of sound funding during periods of volatility in the market."

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Atletico Madrid put on a second half show to beat third-tier Lleida Esportiu 3-0 on Tuesday and progress to the King’s Cup quarter-finals 7-0 on aggregate. 
The Catalonian side put up a good fight to stay level in the first half at a half-empty Wanda Metropolitano stadium, with Lucas Hernandez hitting the post and Diego Costa denied when one-on-one with the visiting keeper. 
The former Chelsea striker, however, made amends by teeing up Yannick Carrasco to slot home in the 57th minute, giving the few fans inside the stadium something to cheer. 
Kevin Gameiro fired home Atletico’s second 17 minutes later after good work by Angel Correa, before new signing Vitolo netted his first goal for the club after racing onto Fernando Torres’s through ball.

" 22 PM / in an hour UPDATE 1-German union agrees to last-ditch talks to try to avert strikes Reuters Staff 
* Union demands 6 pct higher pay, right to shorter hours 
* Employers reject call for right to shorter hours 
* Union threatens strikes if no deal by Saturday lunchtime (Recasts with union chief comment) 
By Edward Taylor and Ilona Wissenbach 
STUTTGART, Germany, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Powerful German union IG Metall will hold last-ditch talks with employers over higher wages and the right to shorter working hours for industrial workers, it said on Friday, holding off for now on its threat to call all-out strikes. 
After discussions among IG Metall’s leadership, the union has decided to make a final attempt to reach a deal over pay and working conditions, union chief Joerg Hofmann said at a press conference in Frankfurt on Friday. 
If these fail to yield a result by lunchtime on Saturday, IG Metall will escalate the dispute with 24-hour strikes. 
“The outcome of talks remains uncertain,” Hofmann said, adding that differences of opinion over what constitutes a fair wage had widened during the previous four rounds of talks. 
Regional wage talks in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, which is taking the lead in this year’s national wage round, stalled late on Wednesday, raising the prospect of nationwide strikes. 
But three people familiar with the talks told Reuters earlier on Friday that union and employer representatives would extend regional wage negotiations. 
Talks will continue in Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler and sports car brand Porsche as well as auto suppliers Bosch and Mahle, from 1700 GMT. 
Emboldened by the fastest economic growth in six years and record low unemployment, IG Metall is demanding a 6 percent pay rise for 3.9 million metals and engineering workers across Germany. 
“Twenty-four hour strikes would indeed be painful,” a spokesman for BMW said, adding extended walkouts could disrupt production not only at the carmaker but also at suppliers. 
Three hours of stoppages at BMW’s Munich factory on Wednesday resulted in 250 cars not being assembled, BMW said, adding it was working to make up the production shortfall. 
Premium rival Audi said it too was trying to catch up after around 700 vehicles were not assembled as a result of two stoppages at its Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm factories this week. 
Daimler said it would similarly try to address any production shortfall as quickly as possible after any strikes. 
“We assume we will be able to deliver all vehicles to our customers that they have ordered,” a spokesman said. 
A big sticking point in the talks is a union demand that workers should have the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children, elderly or sick relatives, and return to full-time employment after two years. 
This is IG Metall’s first major push for shorter hours since workers staged seven weeks of strikes in 1984 to help push through a cut of the working week to 35 hours from 40 hours. 
Employers have so far offered a pay rise of 2 percent plus a one-off 200-euro ($245) payment and have rejected demands for a shorter working week unless employers are allowed to increase hours temporarily as well. 
More than 900,000 workers have taken part in industrial action this year in support of IG Metall’s wage claims. 
Germany’s second biggest union, Verdi, which represents primarily services workers, is expected to publish its wage demand on Feb. 8. 
Verdi and IG Metall together account for around 15 percent of the German workforce, and other sectors tend to broadly follow their agreements. (Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach, Irene Preisinger and Jan Schwartz; Writing by Maria Sheahan and Edward Taylor; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Mark Potter)","On January 26, 2024, the German union IG Metall, representing 3.9 million industrial workers, is set to engage in last-ditch negotiations with employers over a 6% pay increase and the right to reduce working hours from 35 to 28 per week. If no agreement is reached by Saturday lunchtime, the union threatens to initiate 24-hour strikes, following stalled regional talks in Baden-Wuerttemberg. Employers have countered with a 2% pay rise and a one-off €200 payment, rejecting the shorter hours demand unless they can temporarily increase hours. This year, over 900,000 workers have participated in industrial actions supporting IG Metall's claims. The ongoing dispute could disrupt production at major companies like BMW and Audi, which reported losses of 250 and 700 vehicles, respectively, due to recent stoppages. The outcome of these negotiations is critical, as IG Metall's last significant push for shorter hours occurred during a seven-week strike in 1984."

That's according to excerpts released by the White House. Trump also says issues like immigration would be ""so simple"" to solve if they were pure business matters, but he says he realizes that ""millions and millions of people"" are affected by his actions. He adds that ""it's much different, in that way, than I thought it would be. ""

Mrs. Trump has been keeping a low profile following a report that adult film star Stormy Daniels had an affair with Donald Trump in 2006, shortly after he and the first lady wed. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump's personal lawyer brokered a $130,000 payment to Daniels to prohibit her from publicly discussing the alleged affair before the presidential election. 3:55 p.m. Many congressional Democrats are giving their guest passes for President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address to young immigrants known as ""Dreamers,"" who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. More than 20 Dreamers are expected in the House gallery Tuesday night to put a face on the toll of the congressional stalemate on immigration policy. They are the guests of high-profile Democrats including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and potential 2020 presidential candidates including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Trump ended Obama-era protections for such immigrants. He now says he wants to grant them a path to citizenship, but Congress has been unable to come up with a legislative solution for an issue at the center of the recent government shutdown.

President Donald Trump has told news anchors from all the major TV networks at a White House lunch that he is striving to bring the country together.

He says if he could unite the country, he would consider it a great achievement.","Following reports of an alleged 2006 affair between Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels, Mrs. Trump has maintained a low profile.

A White House official says national security adviser H.R. McMaster and economic adviser Gary Cohn contributed to the speech Trump plans to deliver Tuesday night at the Capitol. The official says they were assisted by policy adviser Stephen Miller, staff secretary Rob Porter and other speechwriters. The official stressed that the speech is the president's and that Trump has spent months giving his aides ""tidbits"" on lines he wants to use.

Trump argues that the tax overhaul he signed into law late last year has boosted business confidence and will lead companies to reinvest in the United States.","In his State of the Union address, President Trump will emphasize a strong economy and seek bipartisan immigration action, leveraging his tax overhaul to boost business confidence, marking his second year in office."

"January 17, 2018 / 10:28 PM / Updated an hour ago Barca lose to Espanyol in Cup after Messi penalty miss Richard Martin 2 Min Read 
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Lionel Messi had a penalty saved as triple King’s Cup holders Barcelona suffered a surprise 1-0 loss at city rivals Espanyol in a quarter-final first leg on Wednesday, ending an unbeaten run of 29 games in all competitions. 
Espanyol’s academy graduate Oscar Melendo crashed in the only goal of the game in the 88th minute after Messi had his spot-kick turned away by former Real Madrid goalkeeper Diego Lopez earlier in the second half. 
Barca had not lost to Espanyol since 2009 and this was their first defeat by their local rivals in the Cup since 1970. The last game they had lost in any competition was in the Spanish Super Cup to Real Madrid on Aug. 16. 
The second leg of the tie at the Nou Camp is on Jan. 25. 
Elsewhere, Sevilla battled back from a goal down to win 2-1 at Atletico Madrid as Diego Simeone’s decision to rest number one goalkeeper Jan Oblak in favour of Miguel Angel Moya backfired. 
Moya clawed a cross into his own net in the 79th minute to cancel out Diego Costa’s arrowed strike six minutes earlier, while Joaquin Correa struck the winner in the 88th to give under-fire new Sevilla coach Vincenzo Montella a much-needed victory. 
Valencia also staged a late comeback to beat last year’s runners-up Deportivo Alaves 2-1 at home. The visiting side went ahead through Ruben Sobrino in the 66th minute but Portugal international Goncalo Guedes levelled for Valencia in the 73rd. 
Alaves defender Adrian Dieguez was dismissed in the 77th for picking up two bookings in the space of nine minutes, and Valencia striker Rodrigo Moreno took full advantage by shooting off the near post eight minutes from time.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Opposition to the Trump administration's plan to expand offshore drilling mounted Wednesday as Democrats from coastal states accused President Donald Trump of punishing states with Democratic leaders and a second Republican governor asked to withdraw his state from the plan. Democrats said Trump and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke were being hypocritical by agreeing to a request by Florida's Republican governor to withdraw from the drilling plan, but not making the same accommodation to states with Democratic governors. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California said on Twitter that his state, ""like Florida, has hundreds of miles of beautiful coastline and a governor who wants to keep it that way. Or is that not enough for blue states? ""
""If local voices matter why haven't they excluded Virginia?"" asked Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. ""Is it because the governor of Florida is a Republican and the Virginia governor is a Democrat?""
The complaints came as South Carolina's Republican governor said Wednesday he is seeking an exemption from the proposed drilling expansion, a move that will test the relationship between Trump and one of his earliest supporters. Gov. Henry McMaster told reporters that risks associated with drilling pose a serious threat to South Carolina's lush coastline and $20 billion tourism industry. ""We cannot afford to take a chance with the beauty, the majesty and the economic value and vitality of our wonderful coastline in South Carolina,"" McMaster said. Opposition to drilling is bipartisan within South Carolina's congressional delegation: All three House members who represent the state's 190 miles of coastline told The Associated Press they are against the expansion plan. Two of the three are Republicans, including Rep. Mark Sanford, a former governor who said Zinke had set a precedent by honoring Florida's request for an exemption.","Opposition to the Trump administration's offshore drilling expansion plan intensified as Democrats from coastal states criticized the lack of exemptions for Democratic-led states. South Carolina's Republican Governor Henry McMaster sought an exemption, citing risks to the state's $20 billion tourism industry. All three House members representing South Carolina's 190 miles of coastline oppose the plan, including two Republicans. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff highlighted California's similar coastline, questioning the inconsistency in exemptions granted."
"""What's good for the goose is good for the gander,"" Sanford said, adding that Republicans should respect local wishes. In Virginia, GOP Rep. Scott Taylor joined Kaine and Gov.-elect Ralph Northam in opposing the drilling plan. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., called Trump's plan ""a complete non-starter. ""
Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said on Twitter that ""the only science @SecretaryZinke follows is political science. He'll reverse course to protect fellow Republicans in Florida, but not to protect coastlines and jobs across the rest of the country? Totally unacceptable. ""
Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for Zinke, accused Kaine and other Democrats of taking cheap shots at her boss. ""The secretary has said since day one that he is interested in the local voice. If those governors would like to request meetings with the secretary, they are absolutely welcome to do so,"" she said. ""Their criticism is empty pandering.","In Virginia, GOP Rep. Scott Taylor, Sen. Mark Warner, and Gov.-elect Ralph Northam oppose Trump's drilling plan, while Sen. Jeff Merkley criticizes Secretary Zinke's political motivations. Zinke's spokeswoman claims Democrats' criticisms are mere pandering."
"""
As of Wednesday, only McMaster and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina had requested a meeting with Zinke on offshore drilling, Swift said. In Oregon, Democratic Gov. Kate Brown took to Twitter to ask Zinke for relief. Linking to Zinke tweet about Florida, Brown wrote: ""Hey @secretaryzinke, how about doing the same for #Oregon? ""
Zinke said after a brief meeting with Scott at the Tallahassee airport Tuesday that drilling in Florida waters would be ""off the table,"" despite a plan that proposed drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean off Florida. The change of course — just five days after Zinke announced the offshore drilling plan — highlights the political importance of Florida, where Trump narrowly won the state's 29 electoral votes in the 2016 election and has encouraged Scott to run for Senate. The state is also important economically, with a multibillion-dollar tourism business built on sunshine and miles of white sandy beaches. And Florida is where Trump has a winter home in Palm Beach. Trump spent his Christmas and New Year's break at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Former White House ethics chief Walter Shaub said Zinke's decision to exempt Florida from the drilling plan appears to be a conflict of interest for Trump. Trump is ""exempting the state that is home to the festering cankerous conflict of interest that the administration likes to call the 'Winter White House' and none of the other affected states,"" Shaub tweeted.","As of Wednesday, only two governors, McMaster and Roy Cooper, requested meetings with Zinke regarding offshore drilling. Zinke announced that drilling in Florida waters would be ""off the table,"" just five days after proposing it. Florida, crucial for Trump's 29 electoral votes and its multibillion-dollar tourism industry, is also home to his Mar-a-Lago resort."
"Zinke said Tuesday that ""Florida is obviously unique"" and that the decision to remove the state came after meetings and discussion with Scott, a Trump ally and a likely candidate for the Senate seat now held by Democrat Bill Nelson. Nelson called Scott's meeting with Zinke ""a political stunt"" and said Scott has long wanted to drill off Florida's coast, despite his recent opposition. Scott's office said he repeatedly voiced his opposition to drilling to Zinke, including at an October meeting in Washington. ""Senator Nelson and anyone else who opposes oil drilling off Florida's coast should be happy the governor was able to secure this commitment. This isn't about politics. This is good policy for Florida,"" said John Tupps, a Scott spokesman. Zinke announced plans last week to greatly expand offshore oil drilling from the Atlantic to the Arctic and Pacific oceans, including multiple areas where drilling is now blocked. The plan was immediately met with bipartisan opposition on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Democratic governors along both coasts unanimously oppose drilling, as do a number of Republican governors, including McMaster, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Massachusetts Gov. Charles Baker. The five-year plan announced by Zinke would open 90 percent of the nation's offshore reserves to development by private companies.","Zinke announced a five-year plan to expand offshore oil drilling, opening 90% of the U.S. offshore reserves to private development. This plan faced bipartisan opposition from governors along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, including Democrats and Republicans like McMaster and Hogan, amid controversy over Florida's unique status in the discussions."
"January 17, 2018 / 12:11 AM / Updated 23 minutes ago British lawmakers back Brexit legislation, stiffer tests yet to come William James 4 Min Read 
LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers voted in favour of the government’s legislative blueprint for Brexit on Wednesday, marking a victory for Prime Minister Theresa May over political opponents who want a softer approach to leaving the European Union. 
But the legislation will now face scrutiny from parliament’s largely pro-EU upper house, where May’s party does not have a majority, which will intensify efforts to force a re-run of a 2016 referendum, and water down or even stop the divorce. 
The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill was approved by a 324 to 295 vote in the lower house - a milestone on the long road towards cementing the legal foundations of Britain’s departure from the bloc. 
The bill repeals the 1972 law that made Britain a member of the EU, and transfers EU laws into British ones. 
“This bill is essential for preparing the country for the historic milestone of withdrawing from the European Union,” Brexit minister David Davis told parliament before the vote. 
“It ensures that on day one we will have a statute book that works, delivering the smooth and orderly exit desired by people and businesses across the United Kingdom and being delivered by this government.” 
The bill has become the focal point for months of divisive debate about what type of EU divorce Britain should seek, severely testing May’s ability to deliver on her exit strategy without a parliamentary majority. 
But despite one embarrassing parliamentary defeat, several government concessions and rebellion from within her own party, May’s Conservative lawmakers overcame opposition from the Labour Party and others. 
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn instructed his lawmakers to vote against passage of the bill because the government had not met conditions set out by the party, demanding safeguards on a range of issues including workers and consumer rights. 
“This bill has never been fit for purpose,” said Labour’s Brexit policy chief, Keir Starmer, describing any attempt to persuade the government that the legislation needed to change as “talking to a brick wall”. LORDS SCRUTINY 
The upper house, the House of Lords, will now begin months of scrutiny of the bill before it can become law. Any changes made by the lords will require approval from the lower house, and the whole process could take until May to complete. 
The House of Lords contains a diverse, largely unelected, mix of political appointees, experts, and members who inherited their positions. Many lords are opposed to Brexit. 
Some of those figures are expected to try to soften the Brexit approach to include remaining in the EU’s single market or a second public vote, but the most likely areas for changes involve technical and constitutional issues. 
May has ruled out a second vote and says Britain will be leaving. Labour’s Corbyn is also committed to following through with Brexit, albeit pushing for different priorities and aims. 
Nevertheless, calls for a second referendum are expected to persist, particularly as both pro- and anti-EU politicians have mooted the possibility recently. 
EU officials and some member states have said they would welcome a change of heart from Britain. 
But, barring a major change of policy from one of the country’s two largest political parties, Britain remains on course to leave the bloc in March 2019. Reporting by William James; Editing by Richard Balmforth","On January 17, 2018, British lawmakers voted 324 to 295 in favor of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, a key step in Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy. This legislation repeals the 1972 law that established EU membership and transfers EU laws into UK law. The bill now faces scrutiny from the House of Lords, which is largely pro-EU and may seek to amend it, potentially delaying the process until May 2018. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn opposed the bill, citing insufficient protections for workers and consumers. Despite internal party rebellions and a previous parliamentary defeat, May's Conservative lawmakers managed to push the bill through. The UK is set to leave the EU in March 2019, although calls for a second referendum continue to emerge from both sides of the political spectrum."

"January 17, 2018 / 6:16 PM / Updated 41 minutes ago Apple plans second U.S. campus, to pay $38 billion in foreign cash taxes Stephen Nellis 4 Min Read 
(Reuters) - Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) will open a second U.S. campus as part of a 5-year, $30 billion U.S. investment plan and will make about $38 billion in one-time tax payments on its overseas cash, one of the largest corporate spending plans announced since the passage of a tax cut signed by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Between the spending plan, tax payments and business with U.S. based suppliers, Apple on Wednesday estimated it would spend $350 billion in the U.S. over the next five years. 
Apple, however, did not say how much of its $252.3 billion in cash abroad, the largest of any U.S. corporation, it would bring to the United States, after the U.S. tax changes cut costs on bringing funds back from overseas. It also did not say whether the spending plan was driven by the new tax law. Apple has traditionally declined to publicly announce its spending plans. 
The iPhone maker, whose products are mostly made in Asian factories, said it plans a wave of investing and hiring in the United States and will create 20,000 jobs through hiring at its existing campus and the new one. It will announce the location later this year. 
About a third of the new spending will be on data centers to house its iCloud, App Store and Apple Music services, a sign of the rising importance of subscription services to a company known for its computers and gadgets. The company has data centers in seven states and also on Wednesday broke ground on an expansion of its operations in Reno, Nevada, where local officials granted it tax breaks on a downtown warehouse. 
The U.S spending would be a significant part of Apple’s overall capital expenditures. Globally, the company spent $14.9 billion in 2017 and expects to spend $16 billion in 2018, figures that include both U.S.-based investments in data centers and other projects and Asian investments in tooling for its contract manufacturers. 
If Apple’s overall capital expenditures continue to expand at the same rate expected this year, the $30 billion investment in the U.S. could represent about a third of its capital expenditures over the next five years. 
The announced tax payment was roughly in line with expectations, said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. The tax bill requires companies to pay a one-time tax on foreign-held earnings whether they intend to bring them back to the United States or not. 
Apple had set aside $36.3 billion in anticipation of tax payments on its foreign cash, meaning the payment would not represent a major impact on its cash flow this quarter. 
Apple also said it would boost its advanced manufacturing fund, which it uses to provide capital and support to suppliers such as Finisar Corp ( FNSR.O ) and Corning Inc ( GLW.N ), from $1 billion to $5 billion. Apple said it plans to spend $55 billion with U.S.-based suppliers in 2018, up from $50 billion last year. AMAZON VS APPLE 
Apple joins Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) in scouting for a location for a second campus. Amazon finished taking applications from cities in October for its second campus. Apple has not said whether it has settled on a second campus location yet. 
Currently, Apple’s largest U.S. operations are in Cupertino, California, at its new “spaceship” Apple Park headquarters, followed by a facility in Austin, Texas where it houses customer service agents and where contract manufacturers assemble some Mac computers. The company also employs several thousand workers and contractors in Elk Grove, California, where it has customer service agents and refurbishes iPhones. 
Apple also has built its own data centers in North Carolina, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona and a recently announced project in Iowa and leases data center space in other states.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans on Friday downplayed the likelihood of a deal soon with Democrats on saving 700,000 young, undocumented U.S. immigrants from being kicked out of the country in March, a possibility created by President Donald Trump.
FILE PHOTO: 'Dreamers' react as they meet with relatives during the 'Keep Our Dream Alive' binational meeting at a new section of the border wall on the U.S.-Mexico border in Sunland Park, U.S., December 10, 2017. REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/File Photo Trump in September ordered an Obama-era program that provided the young “Dreamer” immigrants with work permits and prevented them from being deported to end in six months. The program is known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.
Despite his order, the Republican president has vacillated in his view of the Dreamers. Young people brought to the United States as children illegally and raised and educated in the country, most of them have little or no experience of their parents’ homelands in Latin America, Asia, Africa and elsewhere.
Saving the Dreamers is a high priority for Democrats, but the issue has been swept up in other debates, including one on the wall that Trump wants to build along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Republican Senator John Cornyn, in a tweet on Friday, accused Democrats of trying to force a deal on Dreamers by doing a “slow walk” on efforts to approve critical disaster aid and defense spending.
Two other Republicans late on Thursday said both sides remained far apart. “Our discussions on border security and enforcement with Democrats are much further apart, and that is key to getting a bipartisan deal on DACA,” senators Thom Tillis and James Lankford said in a statement.
Democrats have said they are open to tying DACA to additional funding for border security technology. But they oppose Trump’s wall, projected to cost over $21 billion.
The struggle over the Dreamers carries political weight for both parties heading into the November 2018 midterm congressional elections. Most of the Dreamers came from Mexico and Hispanics tend to vote for Democrats, who hope to gain seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Republican lawmakers met with Trump at the White House on Thursday and initially emerged saying they were optimistic that they could find a legislative fix for DACA.
On Friday and Saturday, Trump and senior Republican congressional leaders are also likely to discuss the issue at a conference held at Camp David, the U.S. president’s mountain retreat in Maryland.
A meeting between leaders of both parties was set for Tuesday.
Cornyn, in an interview on Fox News on Friday, said Trump would demand that an immigration deal address the current visa lottery system and chain migration that unites family members.
“Those are things that he’s insisted upon,” and Democrats would have to embrace them along with border security, said Cornyn.

While saving the Dreamers is a priority for Democrats, discussions are complicated by Trump's proposed $21 billion border wall. Republican Senators Thom Tillis and James Lankford noted significant gaps in negotiations on border security. As the November 2018 midterm elections approach, the political stakes are high, especially since many Dreamers are from Mexico and tend to vote Democratic. A bipartisan meeting is scheduled for Tuesday to address these issues."

"By Louise Melling January 19, 2018 
The Trump administration announced Thursday that it will create a “Conscience and Religious Freedom” division in the Department of Health and Human Services. The office’s stated goal is to protect institutions and people who refuse to provide medical assistance based on religious objections. It’s a new division, but an old—and dangerously discriminatory—approach to health care. 
Although the administration claims the new office is intended to protect religious beliefs, it will almost surely function to license discrimination against women, LGBT people, and others. Among those the administration wants to protect with today’s announcement are those who refuse to provide abortions. There was, naturally, no mention of the harm to women that results when hospitals refuse to provide abortions or referrals for abortions. Nor was there talk of what happens to women when nurses protest providing women care before and after abortion, as we have seen some do. 
See also: Commentary: ‘Religious Liberty’ Is Not an Excuse to Deny Transgender People Medical Care 
There was also no discussion of how the new division opens the door for health care workers and institutions to discriminate against transgender people, but there is reason to fear that’s just what they intend to do. The Trump administration has already taken protections away from trans students, trans service members, and trans employees. And anti-transgender advocates, who now have significant influence in the White House, have made it clear that a significant part of their agenda is to deprive transgender patients of essential, medically necessary health care. The new division could be one way to further this goal. 
Medical standards, not religious beliefs or moral convictions, should guide our health care policies. No one should be turned away when they need medical help. No one should be humiliated, demeaned, and left to suffer because of who they are or the health care they need. 

While Donald Trump and his administration may claim that initiatives such as this promote liberty, we know the opposite is true. The specifics of what this new division will do are still murky, but the principle of the law has been clear for a long time. Freedom of religion is at the core of our national fabric and our Constitution. But that freedom does not give anyone a right to harm others, including by way of an exemption from our nation’s laws that bar discrimination and that protect our health. Liberty doesn’t involve denying a patient needed health care. Freedom doesn’t include refusing to provide patients medical care based on the sex they were assigned at birth. 
We don’t yet know how the work of this new division will play out. But we will be watching. And should the administration choose to move forward to implement a discriminatory policy, we will see them in court. 
Louise Melling is the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ","On January 19, 2018, the Trump administration announced the creation of a ""Conscience and Religious Freedom"" division within the Department of Health and Human Services, aimed at protecting individuals and institutions that refuse medical assistance based on religious objections. Critics argue this initiative could lead to discrimination against women and LGBT individuals, particularly in cases involving abortion and transgender healthcare. The administration has previously rolled back protections for transgender individuals in various sectors. The ACLU's deputy legal director, Louise Melling, emphasized that medical standards should guide healthcare policies, asserting that religious freedom should not permit harm or discrimination against patients. The implications of this division remain uncertain, but legal challenges are anticipated if discriminatory practices arise."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Talks between North and South Korea ahead of next month’s Winter Olympics have eased fears of war over Pyongyang’s development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States - at least for now. But North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has shown no sign of willingness to give in to U.S. demands and negotiate away a weapons program he sees as vital to his survival, so any reduction in tensions could prove shortlived. Rhetoric on all sides may have moderated as a result of the first round of intra-Korean talks in more than two years on Tuesday, but U.S. officials say hawks in President Donald Trump’s administration, up to and including Trump himself, remain pessimistic that they will lead anywhere. In recent days, in a series of media leaks, U.S. officials have spoken of the president’s willingness to consider a limited preemptive strike on North Korea to change Kim’s mindset, despite the risk of touching off a war. But there are divisions within the administration. National security adviser H.R. McMaster has been the most vocal of Trump’s aides arguing for a more active military approach, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the military leadership have urged caution, stressing the need to exhaust diplomatic options, according to five officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. A White House National Security Council official said the administration was “constantly developing a range of options, both military and non-military” but declined to address any differences between senior aides. The Pentagon declined comment on internal discussions, though one spokesman said Mattis had stressed in public that the effort to confront the North Korean crisis was diplomatically led. The State Department referred to Tillerson’s statements on the need to pursue diplomacy backed by strong military options. According to the narrative put forth by those advocating a tougher response, a strike could be limited to a single target with the aim of making Kim see reason, not to topple his government, something North Korea’s neighbor and only major ally, China, would not countenance, the officials said.","Talks between North and South Korea ahead of the Winter Olympics have temporarily eased war fears over North Korea's nuclear missile development. Despite this, Kim Jong Un remains unwilling to negotiate his weapons program, vital for his survival. U.S. officials express skepticism about the talks' effectiveness, with President Trump considering a limited preemptive strike. Divisions exist within his administration, with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster advocating military action, while others, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, emphasize diplomatic solutions."
"“Trump is convinced the only thing Kim understands and respects is a punch in the face, which he thinks no previous administration has had the guts to do,” one U.S. official said. “At a minimum, he thinks that warning the Chinese about a preemptive strike would motivate Beijing to force Kim to shut down the programs that threaten the U.S.,” the official said. It remains unclear whether these disclosures by people close to the internal deliberations were simply psychological warfare aimed at sowing strategy-changing fear within the North Korean leadership or reflected Trump’s serious intent. However, the administration’s debate on whether to put greater emphasis on strike plans has slowed because of the North-South contacts and February’s Winter Olympics to be hosted by South Korea. Pyongyang said it would send a delegation. Some U.S. officials have suggested that North Korea was using diplomatic overtures to try to drive a wedge between Washington and ally Seoul and did not intend to engage seriously. The South and the United States are technically still at war with the North because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. A new dawn: tmsnrt.rs/2Ar8lUu
‘WHO KNOWS WHERE IT LEADS?’ Trump’s public response to the intra-Korean meeting has been mostly positive though at times tinged with skepticism. FILE PHOTO:","Trump believes Kim only respects force, unlike previous administrations. He thinks warning China about a preemptive strike could pressure Kim to halt programs threatening the U.S. The U.S. and South Korea remain technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty."
"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson concludes his remarks on the U.S.-Korea relationship during a forum at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, U.S. December 12, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo “Who knows where it leads?” he told reporters on Wednesday after discussing the talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a long-time advocate of dialogue with Pyongyang and whose capital Seoul could be devastated in any major conflict.
Trump, who has exchanged insults and threats with Kim in recent months, was Quote: d on Thursday as telling the Wall Street Journal in an interview: “I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.” Trump offered no details and asked whether he had spoken with Kim, said: “I don’t want to comment on it. I‘m not saying I have or I haven‘t.” The administration had been due to hold a Cabinet-level meeting this week to sharpen its economic and military options for dealing with North Korea. But officials say this discussion has been postponed until after the Paralympic Games, which follow the Olympics and end in March, given the intra-Korean talks and a planned 20-country meeting on North Korea hosted by Canada next week. The Vancouver meeting, aimed at increasing the U.S.-led pressure campaign against Pyongyang, was announced by Washington just after North Korea’s last intercontinental ballistic missile test in late November. One U.S. official said one option would be to bomb a North Korean missile or nuclear facility based on a “high confidence” intelligence assessment that North Korea planned another test. Such a strike could be triggered by evidence that North Korea was fueling an ICBM, the official said.","On December 12, 2017, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed U.S.-Korea relations, emphasizing the potential devastation of Seoul in conflict. President Trump claimed to have a ""very good relationship"" with Kim Jong Un but provided no details. A Cabinet meeting on North Korea was postponed until after the March Paralympic Games. A 20-country meeting in Vancouver aims to enhance pressure on Pyongyang following its late November missile test."
"Another option would be a retaliatory strike on an ICBM or nuclear site after a test, another official said. The officials said McMaster has argued that if China were assured that a strike would be limited to one target and not the beginning of a campaign to overthrow Kim, an all-out war could be avoided. Chinese political experts said China was opposed to even limited strikes. However, Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing, said China’s attitude might change if North Korea launched a nuclear-tipped ICBM into the Pacific Ocean or fired missiles toward Guam. China sees the Trump administration’s discussion of military options as a psychological game to force Beijing and Moscow to maintain pressure on Pyongyang, but they were making crisis preparations just in case, Zhao said. “Even if Trump is not really serious about a military strike, there is always the risk of miscalculation or an over-reaction from North Korea,” Zhao said. A South Korean official said Seoul believed the chance of a U.S. strike was still low. “President Trump is aware of the consequences. He’s been advised by a lot of agencies and departments of the damage it would cause and the number of victims,” the official said. The prevailing view at the State Department is that military action is not worth the huge risk, a senior U.S. official said.","Officials discussed a potential retaliatory strike on North Korea's ICBM or nuclear sites, with McMaster suggesting limited strikes could prevent all-out war. Chinese experts oppose any strikes, but may reconsider if North Korea launches a nuclear-tipped ICBM. A South Korean official noted the low likelihood of a U.S. strike, citing Trump's awareness of potential consequences and casualties."
"However, the official said, “there are military options that could achieve benefits we consider in our national interest at a cost we are willing to bear.” The consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies is Kim is convinced Washington seeks to overthrow him and only a nuclear arsenal can deter that. A Japanese ruling party lawmaker said he did not believe the Korean talks could narrow the gap between North Korea’s demand for recognition as a nuclear-armed state and the U.S. refusal to accept that. “It may be dangerous after the Olympics,” the lawmaker said.

"January 14, 2018 / 12:02 AM / Updated 15 hours ago Golf-Missile false alarm causes panic for PGA Tour players Reuters Staff 2 Min Read 
Jan 13 (Reuters) - Some of the world’s top professional golfers were panicked by a false report of an incoming ballistic missile in Hawaii on Saturday, with one hiding under a mattress and another fleeing to the basement of his Honolulu hotel. 
The alert, issued shortly after 8 A.M. local time (1800 GMT), was sent mistakenly some three hours before the start of the third round of the PGA Tour’s Sony Open. 
“So this can’t be good. Everyone is freaking out in the hotel,” Steve Wheatcroft tweeted at 8.14 A.M. local time (1814 GMT). 
Another player, J.J. Spaun, took refuge in his hotel basement. 
“Barely any service. Can you send confirmed message over radio or tv,” he said in a tweet at 8.26 A.M. 
Two minutes after that, John Peterson revealed the evasive steps he had taken. 
“Under mattresses in the bathtub with my wife, baby and in laws. Please lord let this bomb threat not be real,” tweeted Peterson, who was tied for second place halfway through the tournament. 
Peterson and Spaun evidently took longer than Justin Thomas to receive word the warning had been sent out by mistake. 
“To all that just received the warning along with me this morning ... apparently it was a ‘mistake’ - hell of a mistake!! Haha glad to know we’ll all be safe,” Thomas, the defending champion and world number four, tweeted at the same time as Spaun. 
The third round started on time at Waialae Country Club.

"Whether you like it or not, driverless vehicles are going to become an increasingly important cog in 21st century living.
As technology moves at a rapid pace, the world's biggest companies are looking to develop and deploy increasingly sophisticated self-driving technology. To give one example, Vehicles at Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, have software and sensors designed to detect everything from pedestrians and cyclists to road works and other vehicles.
Ride-hailing powerhouse Uber is also looking to make a mark in the self-driving market. ""In 2019, we've committed to buy 24,000 Volvo SUVs that we're going to equip with our autonomous driving technology and start to roll out on the Uber app,"" Fred Jones, the business' head of cities in the U.K. and Ireland, told CNBC.
Autonomous vehicles will not only change the way we get around our cities. Their economic impact will also be significant. The U.K. government, for instance, has said that the driverless technology market is set to be worth as much as £50 billion to the economy by 2035.
As the way we drive undergoes a transformation, regulations will have to be modified. Unsurprisingly, that is going to be a big, big job.
""There are no rules right now, international rules, on how to regulate automated vehicles,"" Philippe Crist, project manager for the International Transport Forum (ITF), told CNBC.
""The safety regulation of automated vehicles will have to be the same as for regular vehicles, using the same principles."" The ITF is an intergovernmental organization at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The ""object"" of regulation, Crist explained, may change. Before, it was a driver and their vehicle. Now, it would need to include the algorithms and code that operate in an autonomous one.
He added that future regulation would also include, to a certain extent, ""the fitness of the sensor systems that are providing input to the vehicle (and) replacing human eyes and human ears."" This was a new space for regulation, he said.
And, as the way we drive morphs from using our hands to using smart, autonomous vehicles, Crist pointed to another striking development taking place.
""One of the things we've seen is the knowledge about what's taking place on the streets, on roads, has shifted from the public sector to the private sector,"" he said.
""Now, instantaneously, several companies know better what's happening on city streets, and public authorities who are mandated to manage those streets and manage transport infrastructure and investment don't have that insight.""
Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .","Driverless vehicles are poised to play a crucial role in 21st-century living, with the U.K. government estimating the autonomous technology market could reach £50 billion by 2035. Companies like Waymo and Uber are leading the charge, with Uber committing to purchase 24,000 Volvo SUVs equipped with self-driving technology by 2019. However, the lack of international regulations poses challenges, as highlighted by Philippe Crist from the ITF, who notes that safety regulations must evolve to include algorithms and sensor systems. This shift in knowledge from public to private sectors complicates the management of urban transport infrastructure."

"Pope Francis advised against making the pursuit of money, a career or success the basis for one's whole life, urging people in his Epiphany remarks Saturday to also resist ""the inclinations toward arrogance, the thirst for power and for riches.""
Francis said during a homily at Mass in St. Peter's Basilica that people ""often make do"" with having ""health, a little money and a bit of entertainment.""
He urged helping the poor and others in need of assistance, giving freely without expecting anything in return.
Many Christians observe Epiphany to recall the three wise men who followed a star to find baby Jesus. Francis suggested asking ""what star we have chosen to follow in our lives.""
""Some stars may be bright, but do not point the way. So it is with success, money, career, honors and pleasures when these become our lives,"" the pope said. That path, he continued, won't ensure peace and joy.
Later, during an appearance from his studio window overlooking St. Peter's Square, Francis told tens of thousands of faithful gathered below that some Christians prefer to live while indifferent to Jesus.
""Instead of conducting themselves in coherence with their own Christian faith, they follow the principles of the world, which lead to satisfying the inclinations toward arrogance, the thirst for power and for riches,"" Francis said.
He prayed that instead that ""the world makes progress down the path of justice and of peace.""
Francis noted that some Eastern Rite Catholic and Orthodox churches are celebrating Christmas this weekend. In expressing cordial wishes to these believers, Francis added, ""May this glorious celebration be a source of new spiritual vigor and of communion among us Christians.""
He also recalled the traditions such as in Poland, where many families join in processions recalling the three wise men. In some countries, Epiphany and not Christmas, is the holiday occasion to exchange gifts among loved ones.","In his Epiphany remarks on January 6, 2024, Pope Francis cautioned against prioritizing money, career, and success over spiritual values, emphasizing the importance of helping the poor. He noted that many people settle for ""health, a little money, and a bit of entertainment."" During his address to tens of thousands in St. Peter's Square, he highlighted the need for Christians to align their lives with their faith rather than worldly desires, urging a focus on justice and peace."

"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Garbine Muguruza’s preparations for next week’s Australian Open were thrown into disarray when the world number three pulled out of the Sydney International due to a leg injury on Wednesday.
Hours after battling past Kiki Bertens 6-3 7-6(6) to advance to the quarter-finals in her opening match, the 24-year-old Spanish top seed withdrew with a right thigh complaint.
“I am disappointed but I have talked to the WTA doctors and my team after the match and following their recommendation, I have to withdraw from the tournament,” Muguruza said in a statement.
“I have felt pain in my right adductor since I started practicing here. Yesterday, I felt better and wanted to play. However, during the match today the pain has been there all the time but I wanted to compete.”
The Wimbledon champion accepted a wildcard into the tournament after retiring with leg cramps during her opening match at the Brisbane International last week and called for a medical timeout after just three games against Bertens.
Muguruza, however, returned to the Ken Rosewall Arena and appeared to be moving freely, initially allaying fears of another injury setback by overcoming a woman who had beaten her in straight sets in their three previous meetings.
”Since the start I felt a little bit my adductor,“ Muguruza said after registering her first win of the season. ”I already felt it in Brisbane, so I thought I was going to be much better, but it came back.
”You always have to adapt... Sometimes you don’t need to have a pain. You just want to play a certain style of game or some tactic.
“I figured out that being a little bit more aggressive, shorter points, that might help me and might help me also for my game. So it’s like a winning situation.”
Muguruza’s withdrawal allows Daria Gavrilova a direct route to the semi-finals after the Spaniard’s scheduled last eight opponent won an all-Australian clash against Samantha Stosur 6-4 6-2.
Elsewhere, Agnieszka Radwanska, the 2013 champion and last year’s losing finalist in Sydney, kept her preparations for the year’s first grand slam on track with a 7-6(4) 6-0 win over teenage American qualifier CiCi Bellis.
The Polish 28-year-old will meet Camila Giorgi for a place in the last four after the Italian qualifier ousted twice Wimbledon and former Sydney champion Petra Kvitova 7-6(7) 6-2.
Giorgi, belying her ranking of 100th in the world, beat U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in the first round and added another grand slam champion to her list of victims in just under two hours when Kvitova blasted a forehand wide.
In the men’s draw, Italian veteran Paolo Lorenzi ousted top seed Albert Ramos-Vinolas of Spain in the second round.
Ramos-Vinolas needed treatment for a leg problem early in the second set and fell 6-3 7-5 to the 36-year-old Lorenzi, who is ranked 45 in the world.

"January 18, 2018 / 1:04 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago Beijing Games could help end NHL/IOC standoff Steve Keating 5 Min Read 
(Reuters) - Since saying “I do” to the International Olympic Committee in 1998 the National Hockey League and Winter Games have endured an often tumultuous relationship, one that ended last year in an acrimonious separation. In sporting terms this had been an arranged marriage and after five consecutive Winter Games together the NHL, feeling unappreciated and taken advantage of, told the IOC their players would not compete in Pyeongchang. During protracted negotiations to get the world’s best ice hockey players to the Olympics there had been plenty of finger pointing and take-it-or-leave-it ultimatums. The NHL, already convinced it could get by just fine without the exposure offered by the Olympics, relaunched its World Cup of Hockey in 2016 and made that tournament its top international commitment. The jilted IOC huffed and warned NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman not to come knocking in four years time when the 2022 Olympics will be in Beijing, a market that every major sports league covets. While NHL players will not be in South Korea for the Feb. 9-25 Olympics the league has already begun flirting with China having staged their first exhibition games there last September. International Ice Hockey Federation president Rene Fasel said this month it is his mission to get the NHL back on Olympic ice while NHL Players Association head Donald Fehr said the players want to return to the Winter Games. “The Olympics is a unique event and it provides not only an opportunity to play at an elite level but there’s a real element of patriotism and national pride that’s involved and it matters a lot,” Fehr told Reuters. “I think that it is very likely as we go forward that getting back into the Olympics will be something the players will want to pursue.”","Since 1998, the NHL and IOC have had a tumultuous relationship, culminating in the NHL's decision not to send players to the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics after five consecutive Winter Games. The NHL, which relaunched the World Cup of Hockey in 2016, feels unappreciated and has begun engaging with China, having held exhibition games there in September 2017. Both the International Ice Hockey Federation and NHL Players Association express a desire for NHL players to return to the Olympics, emphasizing the event's unique patriotic significance."
"“It will be a significant issue.” COLLECTIVE BARGAINING 
Significant enough that the Olympics will be a carrot dangled when players and owners negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement sometime between now and 2022. It remains to be seen what the players might be willing to give up to get back on the global stage that is offered by the Winter Games. FILE PHOTO: Donald Fehr, executive director of the National Hockey League Players Association, speaks at a news conference in New York September 12, 2012. REUTERS/Eric Thayer 
When the NHL dangled Pyeongchang participation in front of the NHLPA in exchange for an extension of the current CBA the proposal was flatly rejected. “From my personal standpoint not only do the players want to participate in it but I think that participation in the Olympic Games, if it is handled right, is a very significant potential marketing and exposure opportunity for NHL players and therefore NHL hockey,” said Fehr. “I would hope that we get to the point where that is recognised.” While the NHL saw little upside in shutting down operations for almost three weeks to accommodate Olympic participation, the 2022 Beijing Games represent a gateway into the Chinese market.","The NHL's collective bargaining negotiations, set for 2022, may leverage Olympic participation as a bargaining chip. Players previously rejected a proposal for Pyeongchang participation. NHLPA's Donald Fehr emphasized the marketing potential of the Olympics, particularly for the 2022 Beijing Games, which could open the Chinese market."
"To grow hockey in China the NHL will need infrastructure and the Chinese government and businesses have already displayed a keen interest in helping the cause by building ice rinks. ”I guess they (NHL) are a little late to the (China) party but better to do it right than do it fast,“ David Carter, executive director at the USC Sports Business Institute and a member of the Los Angeles Kings advisory board, told Reuters. ”They would more likely look back and rue the day they didn’t figure this thing out than looking back and saying it was a wise move to forego the Games. ”It is a big market to penetrate and it is something that has captivated people in sport business for awhile. “But that doesn’t get you anywhere unless the home country is willing to spend time, money and invest capital in it.” The key to getting the NHL back on board for the 2022 Games will not be as simple as the lure of tapping into a new market. The NHL has long bristled at paying for the privilege of competing at the Olympics while, in their view, getting very little in return beyond the prestige and a two-week global platform for their product. ”China is a completely different economic opportunity than South Korea,“ Neal Pilson, head of Pilson Communications and former president of CBS Sports, told Reuters. ”There was really no way to figure out any possible benefit for the NHL allowing its players to play in South Korea but the league could negotiate a much better deal for its ownership when you are talking about teams, the league, the sport growing in 
China. ”I know they are thinking about how they can develop hockey in that nation.","To grow hockey in China, the NHL must invest in infrastructure, with the Chinese government and businesses already building ice rinks. David Carter noted the NHL's late entry into the market, emphasizing the importance of doing it right. The NHL has historically resisted Olympic participation due to perceived lack of benefits, but experts like Neal Pilson highlight China's potential as a lucrative opportunity compared to South Korea, urging the league to negotiate better terms for growth."

"Flooding from a water main break forced the temporary suspension of some flights at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Sunday, adding to the misery of travelers after a winter storm canceled or delayed hundreds of flights in recent days.
Water poured from the ceiling onto a check-in counter and covered large areas of the floor of Terminal 4, video on CNN showed. The disruption occurred while the U.S. Northeast continued to endure bone-chilling weather with the New York temperature at 17 degrees Fahrenheit (-8 Celsius).
International flights to Terminal 4 were temporarily suspended and passengers who had already arrived there were diverted to other terminals, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport.
The Port Authority said the water pipe break appears to be weather-related. Flights later resumed but with delays, it said.

Kennedy Airport in New York, United States on January 08, 2017. ""What happened at JFK Airport is unacceptable, and travelers expect and deserve better,"" Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton said in a statement.
The authority said a water pipe that feeds the terminal's sprinkler system broke, which caused flooding and a led to a temporary power cut in some areas as a safety measure.
The airport on Twitter advised travelers to check with their airlines before arriving.
There were about 3 inches (7.5 cm) of water inside the west end of Terminal 4, Scott Ladd, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said in an email.
The flooding hit just as the airport was crawling back to normal after a winter storm labeled a ""bomb cyclone"" forced the airport to close on Thursday.
When operations resumed on Friday, the backlog led to hundreds more delays or cancellations, crowding the terminals with stranded passengers.

Kennedy Airport in New York, United States on January 08, 2017. More than 500 flights into or out of JFK were canceled and nearly 1,400 delayed from Friday morning to Sunday afternoon, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.
The extreme cold and recovery from Thursday's snowstorm created a ""cascading series of issues for the airlines and terminal operators,"" the Port Authority said.
Equipment froze and baggage handling was delayed, which was compounded by staff shortages and heavier than normal passenger loads, the Port Authority said. The backlog left passengers stuck on planes for long stretches while waiting for other aircraft to get in and out of gates.","On Sunday, flooding from a broken water main at New York's JFK Airport temporarily suspended international flights at Terminal 4, exacerbating travel disruptions following a winter storm that had already canceled over 500 flights and delayed nearly 1,400 from Friday to Sunday.

""You're right,'' he said. ""I literally have been inundated,"" he reluctantly acknowledged, almost embarrassed, when we spoke Monday. ""People have talked to me about some very large companies and some digital technology companies. Obviously, I can't say from a confidentiality standpoint.","Since announcing his retirement in fall 2023, Kenneth I. Chenault, a prominent African-American CEO, has received numerous offers from companies. Recently, he joined the boards of Facebook and Airbnb, while keeping other potential opportunities confidential. He has been approached by various large and tech firms."
"""
The recruiters can stop calling. On Tuesday, he will announce he has a new full-time job. Mr. Chenault, a name long synonymous with Wall Street, will soon become a staple of Silicon Valley as a venture capitalist. He will be chairman and managing director of General Catalyst Partners, one of the most successful venture firms of the past two decades, with stakes in companies like Airbnb, Snap , Stripe and Warby Parker. Mr. Chenault 's choice to jump into the world of start-ups is more than just a business decision; to him, it is an opportunity to have a larger impact on Silicon Valley and its business culture. As he assessed his opportunities, he became convinced that the tech start-up world had often come up short in meeting society's challenges. This area, he said, is where he hopes he can have an impact. Consider Mr. Chenault some much-needed adult supervision. ""What I think is happening right now in the digital space is a maturation cycle and some people, as we've seen, are going to handle that well and some people are going to crash and burn,"" he said, without naming names. Of course, he could be talking about any of a host of companies, like Uber, Google or Facebook, the latter of which is facing a revolt among consumers and possibly regulators over the way fake news proliferates on its site.","On Tuesday, Mr. Chenault will announce his new role as chairman and managing director of General Catalyst Partners, a top venture firm with stakes in companies like Airbnb, Snap, Stripe, and Warby Parker. He aims to address societal challenges in Silicon Valley's tech start-up culture, emphasizing the need for maturity in the digital space."
"Venture capital firms themselves are not exempt from these problems, as my colleague Katie Benner chronicled last summer with a striking exposé of harassment by powerful investors. ""Given their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,'' Mr. Chenault said. ""And we do have serious problems. ""
""Companies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,"" he added. ""Companies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality. ""
Mr. Chenault's management skills may be a perfect fit for the role General Catalyst needs him to fill. As start-ups are staying private longer, venture capital firms are finding that someone has to actually run the companies they invest in, to think beyond the early stages of fast growth — and a quick sale or initial public offering — and to help them scale over a decade. ""The median time to I.P.O. has risen dramatically over the last decade, from 4.9 years in 2006 to 8.3 years in 2016,"" according to a report from Pitchbook, a data company that tracks deals. Airbnb has been private for 10 years, Uber for nine. When Mr. Chenault joined Airbnb's board last week, a company co-founder, Brian Chesky, whom Mr. Chenault has mentored for years, wrote a note to employees announcing the appointment.","Venture capital firms face significant challenges, including harassment issues highlighted by Katie Benner. Mr. Chenault emphasizes the need for companies to embrace broader responsibilities as they mature. The median time to IPO has increased from 4.9 years in 2006 to 8.3 years in 2016, with companies like Airbnb and Uber remaining private for 10 and 9 years, respectively."
"""Many companies are designed to be finite,'' Mr. Chesky wrote. ""Finite companies are focused on beating their competitors and appeasing short-term interests. But business is not finite. Unlike sports, there is no time clock, so there can be no winning or losing — there is merely surviving and innovating to endure. ""
Mr. Chenault believes there is real value in trying to influence start-ups early in their life cycle, so that patience and foresight become embedded in the DNA. One problem Mr. Chenault wants to address — conspicuous to anyone paying attention, but bafflingly inconspicuous to those in the Valley — is the lack of diversity, both in gender and race, in the tech industry. ""Diversity in the technology digital industry is a big issue,"" he said. ""If we don't make accelerated progress in that area, it will have dire consequences for our society. ""
It is even worse in the venture capital industry, where there are few women and even fewer African-Americans. The numbers are embarrassing and depressing: African-Americans make up only 3 percent of the venture capital work force, according to a study conducted in 2016 by the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion.","Mr. Chesky emphasizes that businesses should focus on long-term survival and innovation rather than short-term competition. Mr. Chenault highlights the tech industry's diversity issue, noting that only 3% of the venture capital workforce is African-American, according to a 2016 study by the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte."
"Latinos represented only 4 percent of the venture capital industry. Mr. Chenault said he has known some of founding partners at General Catalyst for more than 20 years, including David Fialkow and Joel Cutler, who have been business partners since they met as children at Camp Cedar (a summer camp in Maine that I also attended). The fund, which has some $3.75 billion, was founded in Cambridge, Mass., in 1999 and has offices in New York; Palo Alto, Calif.; and San Francisco. Mr. Chenault said he would be based in New York. In addition to Facebook and Airbnb, he is also on the boards of IBM and Procter & Gamble , which gives him insight into what's going on in the economy. He acknowledged that there might be times he has to recuse himself from dealing with board issues that conflict with one of the investments General Catalyst makes. But at this stage of his career, he believes a move to venture capital is the right ""vehicle'' to try to make a difference. Mr. Chenault hopes to help companies not just make long-term plans, but to think about their role in society. ""Venture capital firms have to be more catalytic agents of change not just in the business development,"" he said, ""but in helping change the culture in the technology digital sector so there is a greater focus on the responsibilities they have.""","Latinos make up only 4% of the venture capital industry. General Catalyst, founded in 1999 in Cambridge, manages $3.75 billion and has offices in New York, Palo Alto, and San Francisco. Mr. Chenault, who has connections with partners for over 20 years, aims to influence long-term planning and societal roles in technology."

"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China plans to hold government officials to account for the protection of farmland, part of its efforts to guarantee food production amid soaring levels of urbanization.
Local governments will be held fully responsible for retaining and protecting arable land under their jurisdiction, and for improving land quality, according to new guidelines issued by China’s cabinet, the State Council, on Thursday.
Central government funding for soil remediation projects will depend on how well a local government performs when it comes to protecting land, the guidelines published on China’s official government website said.
Protecting land will also become one of the criteria on which local officials are assessed, with failures likely to affect promotion prospects or even result in dismissal.
Food security has long been regarded as a key source of political legitimacy for the Chinese government, with the country having to feed nearly a quarter of the world’s population with just 7 percent of the world’s arable land.
But its farmland has come under increasing pressure due to soaring rates of urbanization and industrial development, which have encroached on traditional farming belts and left large stretches of territory unusable as a result of pollution.
The country’s environmental drive could also put more farmland out of reach, with the government committed to increasing forest coverage and establishing so-called “ecological red lines” that will make large swathes of territory off-limits to development.

 ","China's State Council has issued new guidelines holding local governments accountable for protecting arable land amid urbanization pressures. With 7% of the world's arable land, China must feed nearly 25% of the global population. Local officials' performance on land protection will impact funding and career prospects, as urbanization and pollution threaten farmland."
"ZURICH, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Christine Novakovic has been named head of UBS wealth management in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the bank said, replacing Paul Raphael, who was in charge of Europe and emerging markets.

"BANGKOK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell said on Wednesday that it will sell its stake in the Bongkot gas field and adjoining acreage offshore Thailand to PTT Exploration & Production PCL for $750 million before tax.
The deal with PTTEP comes after Shell in October canceled a $900 million agreement to sell the same gas field stakes to Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC).
“The two deal values are not comparable and we will not comment further on any commercial terms,” a Shell spokeswoman said in an e-mail when asked about the discrepancy between the price tags in the two sale accords.
In a statement, Shell said, “This sale takes Shell a step closer to its divestment target of $30 billion” of non-core assets. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter, both companies said.
PTTEP is the upstream arm of oil giant PTT Pcl and currently operates the Bongkot field, which produces about 860 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 26,000 barrels per day of condensate.
The acquisition is in line with PTTEP’s strategy of adding producing assets or those which are in the final stage of development, located in Southeast Asia where PTTEP has experience, Chief Executive Officer Somporn Vongvuthipornchai said in a statement.
PTTEP is keen to continue as the field’s operator and plans to participate in a bidding round for the Bongkot concession which expires in 2022-2023 to maintain Thailand’s energy security, Somporn said.
Andrew Harwood, research director of Asia Pacific upstream oil and gas at ‎Wood Mackenzie, said the lower sale price for the asset probably reflects PTTEP taking on a larger share of future decommissioning liabilities.
“The deal also puts PTTEP in a stronger position ahead the bidding round, expected to launch by mid-2018,” he said.
The sales agreement covers Shell’s 22.2 percent stake in Blocks 15, 16 and 17 and Block G12/48, the companies said. PTTEP’s stake will increase to 66.7 percent after the purchase, with the remaining 33.3 percent held by France’s Total, they said.
The deal will increase PTTEP’s sales volume by about 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In the bidding round set for mid-2018, over 650 million barrels of oil equivalent of resource will be up for grabs in Thailand, including both the expiring Bongkot concession and areas licensed to Chevron Corp.
Chevron operates the nearby Erawan field under a concession set to expire in 2022.
The fields have a combined output of 2.2 billion cubic feet a day, making up about 76 percent of the Gulf of Thailand’s output.

"PITTSBURGH, Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $1.31 and net income of $131.8 million for Q4 2017. Full-year 2017 EPS was $2.87 and net income was $291.3 million. Federated's Q4 2017 and full-year 2017 results included $70.4 million of net income, representing $0.70 and $0.69 per share for Q4 2017 and full-year 2017, respectively, resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act). Management believes adjusted EPS and adjusted net income, which are non-GAAP financial measures, are useful measures for investors to evaluate Federated's financial performance. The adjusted measures reflect what earnings would have been had the tax law changes not reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, resulting in a revaluation of Federated's net deferred tax liability. As such, Federated's Q4 2017 adjusted EPS was $0.61, up 17 percent from EPS of $0.52 for Q4 2016, and adjusted net income was $61.4 million, compared to net income of $55.8 million for Q4 2016. Full-year 2017 adjusted EPS was $2.18, up 7 percent from EPS of $2.03 for 2016, and adjusted net income was $220.9 million, compared to net income of $208.9 million for 2016 1 .

Financial Summary
Q4 2017 vs. Q4 2016
Revenue decreased by $11.6 million or 4 percent primarily due to a change in a customer relationship and a change in the mix of average money market assets. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order for those funds to maintain positive or zero net yields (voluntary yield-related fee waivers) and an increase in revenue from higher average equity and fixed-income assets. During Q4 2017, Federated derived 60 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (43 percent from equity assets and 17 percent from fixed-income assets) and 40 percent from money market assets. Operating expenses decreased by $17.6 million or 9 percent primarily due to a decrease in distribution expenses related to a change in a customer relationship and lower average money market fund assets, partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses related to a decrease in voluntary yield-related fee waivers. Q4 2017 vs. Q3 2017 Revenue was flat, while operating expenses decreased by $2.1 million or 1 percent primarily due to a decrease in distribution expenses related to a change in the mix of average money market fund assets partially offset by increased professional service fee expenses. 2017 vs. 2016
Revenue decreased by $40.4 million or 4 percent primarily due to a change in the mix of average money market assets and a decrease in revenue resulting from a change in a customer relationship.","As of December 31, 2017, money market mutual fund assets totaled $185.5 billion, a decrease of $20.9 billion (10%) from $206.4 billion in 2016, but an increase of $7.6 billion (4%) from $177.9 billion in September 2017. Federated's separate account assets rose to $79.7 billion, up $33.9 billion (74%) from $45.8 billion in 2016. Q4 2017 revenue fell by $11.6 million (4%), with 60% derived from equity and fixed-income assets, while operating expenses decreased by $17.6 million (9%)."
"The decrease in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in voluntary yield-related fee waivers and an increase in revenue from higher average equity and fixed-income assets. During 2017, Federated derived 59 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (42 percent from equity assets and 17 percent from fixed-income assets) and 41 percent from money market assets. Operating expenses decreased by $46.3 million or 6 percent primarily due to a decrease in distribution expenses related to lower average money market fund assets and a change in a customer relationship, partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses related to a decrease in voluntary yield-related fee waivers. The decrease in operating expenses is also attributable to a decrease in compensation and related expenses resulting from lower incentive compensation. Nonoperating income, net increased by $5.2 million primarily due to an increase in net investment income principally resulting from related gains recorded on available-for-sale securities. Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior.

"videogames Nintendo Just Had Its Best Third Quarter in Eight Years Thanks to Booming Switch Demand A Nintendo Switch exhibit during the Electronic Entertainment Expo E3 at the Los Angeles Convention Center in June. Christian Petersen Getty Images By Reuters 6:33 AM EST 
Japanese videogames maker Nintendo Co Ltd reported its biggest third-quarter operating profit in eight years, driven by smashing demand for its new Switch games console, and said it expected annual earnings to outstrip its previous estimate. 
Growing popularity of the hybrid home-portable Switch has led to a near-doubling of Nintendo‘s stock price to nine-year highs since the device’s launch in March. Sales have exceeded initial estimates, on track to beat the lifetime numbers of its predecessor Wii U, leaving suppliers scrambling for parts. 
Switch console sales will likely hit 15 million units in the year to March and climb to 20 million next year, Nintendo said, fueling hopes of a repeat of the success of the first Wii that debuted in late 2006 and sold more than 100 million units. 
“The momentum for Switch over the last 10 months has been stronger than that of the Wii,” Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima said at an earnings briefing on Wednesday. 
“The key to Switch’s success in the second year will be to attract non-gamers,” he added. 
Analysts believe Nintendo‘s plan to launch “Labo,” LEGO-style accessories for the console that kids can build themselves on cardboard sheets, could bring in a younger audience. 
“This is exactly the kind of crazy idea that Nintendo is known for which we believe will help expand the company’s audience,” analysts at Macquarie wrote in a recent research note. It will be “appealing to younger audience which has not been addressed by Nintendo for some time.” 
Nintendo sold 7.2 million Switch consoles in the three months through December and raised its annual sales forecast by a million from an earlier projection of 14 million units. 
That already exceeds sales of 13.56 million consoles for the Wii U that was on the market from late 2012 through 2017. 
“Switch sales during the holiday season were stronger than expected in Japan, the United States and Europe,” Kimishima said at the briefing. 
Q3 BLOWS PAST CONSENSUS 
Stellar demand for Switch pushed Nintendo‘s operating profit up almost four-fold to 116.50 billion yen ($1.07 billion) for the third quarter. This was the highest ever it has earned for the October-December period since 2009. 
The results beat consensus estimate of around 67 billion yen from six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
The Kyoto-based company raised its profit forecast for the year ending March to 160 billion yen, from 120 billion yen, versus analysts’ estimate of 144 billion yen. 
The company’s annual profit hit a record high of 555 billion yen in the year to March 2009, driven by Wii sales. 
Shares of Nintendo closed up 2% before the quarterly results were announced, versus the wider market that closed down about 1%. 
Nintendo, which relies heavily on Switch to drive its earnings, is looking to diversify its revenue sources by moving into new areas such as smartphone gaming and theme parks with its roster of popular characters. 
But its efforts in smartphone gaming have produced lackluster results. 
It has released four smartphone titles over the last two years, but recently decided to ditch the first one, a social networking service-style application called Miitomo, due to sluggish demand. 
Pokemon GO was a phenomenal success, but Nintendo receives profits only through an affiliate which developed the game with a Google spinoff. 
“The smartphone business is yet to become a profit pillar for Nintendo,” Kimishima said. “We still have a lot to do.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ","Nintendo Co Ltd reported its best third-quarter operating profit in eight years, reaching 116.50 billion yen ($1.07 billion), nearly quadrupling from the previous year and surpassing analyst expectations of 67 billion yen. The surge in profit was driven by strong demand for the Nintendo Switch, with sales hitting 7.2 million units in the three months ending December, raising the annual sales forecast to 15 million units, up from 14 million. The Switch is on track to exceed the Wii U's total sales of 13.56 million units. Nintendo's stock price has nearly doubled since the Switch's launch in March, reaching nine-year highs. The company also raised its annual profit forecast to 160 billion yen, up from 120 billion yen, while exploring new revenue streams in smartphone gaming and theme parks, despite mixed results in mobile gaming."

"January 23, 2018 / 1:15 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Cranberries singer Dolores O'Riordan laid to rest in home town Clodagh Kilcoyne 2 Min Read 
BALLYBRICKEN, Ireland (Reuters) - Cranberries lead singer Dolores O‘Riordan was laid to rest at a private funeral in her home town on Tuesday, remembered as someone who rescued people from “the darkness of depression”. 
O‘Riordan, 46, whose distinctive and powerful Irish voice helped fuel The Cranberries’ rapid rise in the early 1990s, was found dead in a London hotel last week during a recording trip ahead of a planned tour. No cause of death has yet been established. 
Her mother, three children and bandmates Noel Hogan, Mike Hogan and Fergal Lawler attended the service at Saint Ailbe’s Church in the small rural County Limerick town of Ballybricken in the south-west of Ireland. 
“No words are adequate to describe Dolores or to accurately state the influence for good she has been over the years,” Canon Liam McNamara, a family friend who first met O‘Riordan when she was a teenager, told the mourners. Slideshow (4 Images) 
“The numbers she rescued from the darkness of depression are impossible to count.” 
Candles lit the streets of Ballybricken late on Monday, as her coffin was brought to the church where McNamara said she once sang and played keyboard in the local choir. 
The mass began with a recording of Ave Maria sung by O‘Riordan and Italian opera star Luciano Pavarotti. A guitar and a platinum disc award - symbols from a musical career that saw The Cranberries sell over 40 million records, second only to U2 among Irish acts - were brought to the alter. 
O‘Riordan, whose hits with The Cranberries such as “Linger” and “Zombie” catapulted her to fame as a shy 22-year-old, was the “voice of her generation,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said last week. Writing by Padraic Halpin Editing by Jeremy Gaunt","Cranberries lead singer Dolores O'Riordan, 46, was laid to rest in Ballybricken, Ireland, on January 23, 2018, following her death in a London hotel.

"SEATTLE, Jan. 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq:CRAY) today announced selected preliminary 2017 financial results. The 2017 anticipated results presented in this release are based on preliminary financial data and are subject to change until the year-end financial reporting process is complete. Based on preliminary results, total revenue for 2017 is expected to be about $390 million. While a wide range of results remains possible for 2018 and based on the Company’s preliminary 2017 results, Cray expects revenue to grow by 10-15% for 2018. Revenue is expected to be about $50 million for the first quarter of 2018. “With a strong effort across the company and in partnership with our customers, we completed all our large acceptances during the fourth quarter,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO of Cray. “A couple of smaller acceptances that we did not finish are now expected to be completed early in 2018. While 2017 was challenging, we’re beginning to see early signs of a rebound in our core market and I’m proud of the progress we made during the year to position the company for long-term growth.” Based on currently available information, Cray estimates that the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation) passed in December 2017 will result in a reduction to the Company’s GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 in the range of $30-35 million. The large majority of this charge is due to the remeasurement of the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates.","Cray Inc. anticipates 2017 revenue of approximately $390 million, with a projected growth of 10-15% for 2018.

"The charge may differ from this estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, and guidance that may be issued.

"January 9, 2018 / 8:11 AM / Updated an hour ago German industrial workers widen strikes in wage dispute Reuters Staff 2 Min Read 
HAMBURG, Jan 9 (Reuters) - German industrial workers are widening industrial action on Tuesday, with tens of thousands of staff at metals and engineering companies expected to down their tools in support of wage claims by union IG Metall. 
With the economy in robust health and unemployment at record lows, the country’s biggest union is demanding an inflation-busting 6 percent pay hike this year for about 3.9 million workers. 
Ahead of a round of regional negotiations due to begin on Thursday, employers have so far offered 2 percent plus a one-off 200 euro ($240) payment in the first quarter. 
IG Metall has called for industrial action at 143 companies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the industrial heartland of Germany, including LED components firm Lumileds and Thyssenkrupp unit Rothe Erde. 
In Bavaria, employees at 32 companies are expected to walk out. 
That adds to more than 15,000 workers that have already taken action across the nation since the start of last week. 
IG Metall is also campaigning for a right to reduce weekly hours to 28 from 35, and return to full-time employment after two years, for shift workers and those caring for children or other relatives. 
Employers have rejected that proposal too. 
The nationwide dispute follows a strong year of growth in Europe’s largest economy, driven by domestic demand from record numbers of German workers while borrowing costs and inflation remain low and exporters benefit from a global recovery. 
That pattern should extend through 2018, with the Ifo economic institute last month forecasting growth of 2.6 percent for the year. 
Talks between unions and employers’ associations are set for Thursday in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Volkswagen’s Porsche, Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler and automotive suppliers including Bosch are based. 
Next door in Bavaria, home to companies such as engineering group Siemens and carmaker BMW, negotiations will resume on Jan. 15, and to the north in North Rhine-Westphalia on Jan. 18. $1 = 0.8299 euros Reporting by Jan Schwartz; Writing by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Louise Heavens","On January 9, 2018, tens of thousands of German industrial workers, represented by union IG Metall, began widening strikes at 143 companies, demanding a 6% pay increase for approximately 3.9 million workers.

"January 4, 2018 / 2:03 AM / Updated 9 minutes ago METALS-Cold weather heats up lead metal market Reuters Staff 4 Min Read 
SYDNEY, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Forecasts for more frigid weather in the United States this week supported Chinese lead futures on Thursday amid expectations of seasonally strong demand and likely winter shortages. More than 80 percent of global lead consumption is for batteries mainly for autos, and the peak demand period is during the height of winter when freezing temperatures cause battery failures. 
China accounts for about 40 percent of global lead demand, estimated at around 12 million tonnes this year, but faces a potential supply shortfall over coming months due to an environmental crackdown on polluting industries. FUNDAMENTALS 
* LEAD: Three-month lead on the LME slipped 1 percent to $2,553 a tonne by 0138, but remained close to the 11-week peak touched in the Wednesday London session. The most-trade lead contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was up 0.2 percent to 19,290 yuan ($2,967) a tonne. 
* DEFICIT: Wood Mackenzie forecasts the lead market will see a deficit of 115,000 tonnes this year and 56,000 tonnes in 2019 after a 119,000 shortfall last year. 
* FREEZING TEMPERATURES: Much of the eastern United States is in the grips of a sustained cold spell. 
* DOLLAR UP: The dollar extended gains on Thursday after upbeat U.S. data and supportive minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting helped it shake off recent weakness. 
* PRICES: LME copper added 0.3 percent to $7,167 a tonne, while LME aluminium, nickel and zinc all fell. 
* COBALT UNEASE: The emergence of two companies holding large amounts of cobalt on the London Metal Exchange is creating nervousness about price volatility among market participants as interest in the metal continues to soar. 
* SAMARCO TALKS: Vale SA is in talks with BHP Billiton Ltd over the future of their joint venture, Samarco Mineração SA, and one alternative is for the Brazilian miner to buy out its partner, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has extended the deadline for registration of North Korean athletes for the Pyeongchang winter Olympics and is planning more talks with all sides, it said on Monday
The IOC, which is eager to have North Korean athletes at the Games, did not say until when the registration deadline had been extended until but most sports have completed their Olympic qualifying events.
Only a figure skating pair from North Korea has secured a spot in the Games in South Korea in February, although several other athletes could qualify through special places offered by the Olympic body.
“We welcome the discussion which will take place on Wednesday between the governments of the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK),” an IOC spokesman said.
South Korea offered talks with North Korea this week, amid a tense standoff over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year’s Day speech that he was “open to dialogue” with Seoul.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump have exchanged fiery barbs in the last year and Trump has warned that the United States would have no choice but to “totally destroy” North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies.
“As far as the participation of athletes from the National Olympic Committee of DPRK in the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 is concerned, the IOC has been having discussions with both sides for a long time,” the spokesman said.
“In doing so we have kept the door open by extending the deadline for registration, and by offering support to North Korean athletes in the qualification process, whilst always respecting United Nations sanctions.”
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in his New Year’s Day speech that he would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics and North Korea last week reopened a long-closed border hotline with South Korea for talks.
“The IOC will at very short notice continue its talks with all the parties concerned so that we can take the necessary decisions about participation and the format of any participation in due time,” the IOC spokesman said.
”The IOC’s mission is always to ensure the participation of all qualified athletes, beyond all political tensions and divisions.
“With regard to the very particular situation on the Korean peninsula we need the political commitment from all parties concerned to make such a participation possible. Once this political commitment is clear the IOC will take the final decision.”

 ","The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has extended the registration deadline for North Korean athletes for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, set for February 2018, although the new deadline is unspecified. Currently, only one figure skating pair from North Korea has qualified, with potential for more athletes to gain entry through special Olympic spots. The IOC is facilitating discussions between South Korea and North Korea, following Kim Jong Un's New Year’s Day speech expressing openness to dialogue. The IOC emphasizes its commitment to athlete participation amid political tensions, contingent on political agreements from all involved parties."

"January 17, 2018 / 3:06 PM / Updated 6 hours ago Hong Kong star Eric Tsang denies sexual assault allegations Reuters Staff 3 Min Read 
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong celebrity Eric Tsang denied allegations of sexual misconduct on Wednesday and said he was taking legal action against one of his two accusers. 
Tsang, a household name in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Chinese-speaking communities around the world, is one of the most high-profile Asian stars to face such accusations amid a global campaign against sexual harassment and assault. 
Speaking at a news conference, Tsang denied any wrongdoing after being accused in widely circulated online reports of raping a Hong Kong actress in Singapore in the 1990s. 
“Recently, there are some untrue reports on the Internet about myself. Those reports carry very serious accusations toward me,” said Tsang. 
“They have affected my reputation, and sadly, they have hurt my supporting friends, my beloved family, my children ... I feel that there is a need for me to now step up and to make a public response.” 
Tsang, an actor, comedian, director and producer, described the rape allegation as “totally made-up”. 
“I am willing to cooperate with any investigation,” he said. 
He also said that he was taking legal action against Grace Han, a former head of the Ford Modelling agency in Asia, over allegations she had posted on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. 
“Regarding Madam Han’s untrue accusations on Sina Weibo, I have already undertaken legal action to sue her. Currently, legal proceedings are under way,” said Tsang, who took no questions from reporters. 
Han had written on her verified Weibo account in January, after the rape reports began circulating, that Tsang had made “sexual assaults on female celebrities more than once”. On another occasion, she said Tsang had tried to spike the drinks of some of her models in a karaoke lounge in Hong Kong. 
Han gave no immediate response to a Reuters request for comment. 
The campaign aimed at raising awareness of sexual harassment and assault, epitomized by the #MeToo social media hashtag, was last month named Time magazine’s 2017 “Person of the Year”. 
It has sparked numerous accusations by men and women who said they were victimized by high-powered figures in the entertainment industry and other fields.

"January 19, 2018 / 8:12 PM / in 10 minutes Fernandez blows away rivals to claim sixth European title Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber 3 Min Read 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A flawed routine could not stop Javier Fernandez from becoming the first man in more than 80 years to win six consecutive European figure skating titles as the Spaniard proved he will be among the title favourites at next month’s Winter Olympics. 
Despite losing his balance on a double toeloop and stumbling on a triple Salchow, the twice world champion blew away his rivals by more than 20 points with a combined total of 295.55. 
Russian Dmitri Aliev earned silver with 274.06 while his compatriot Mikhail Kolyada improved on his fourth place finish in the short program to snatch the bronze with 258.90. 
Skating to the music from the “Man of La Mancha” musical, the 26-year-old Fernandez became the first man since Karl Schaefer in 1936 to win six in a row. Austrian Schaefer won eight successive golds from 1929. 
The Pyeongchang Olympics will be Fernandez’s third and final Games. He is keen to end his country’s 26-year Winter Olympic medal drought after finishing fourth in Sochi four years ago. 
Kolyada won the bronze despite struggling with his quadruple jumps throughout his free skate, starting with a fall on his opening quad Lutz.

REUTERS/Grigory Dukor FRENCH ICE DANCERS LEAD 
Earlier on Friday French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron took the lead with an upbeat short dance that puts them on pace to win their fourth consecutive European title. 
Dancing to music by British singer Ed Sheeran, the twice world champions produced a solid performance that gave them a comfortable lead with 81.29 points, less than one point away their personal best in the short dance. 
Papadakis and Cizeron, who last year became the first ice dancers to break the 200-points barrier, were left frustrated as they went out of sync on their twizzles. 
“It’s not something that happens often and it’s very frustrating,” Papadakis told reporters. “I guess we will have to work on that.” 
Russians Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin finished nearly six points behind their French rivals after an energetic performance on home ice. 
Italians Anna Cappellini and Luca Lanotte finished third with 74.76 points.

"January 24, 2018 / 9:25 AM / Updated 25 minutes ago Slovenian public sector workers strike for higher wages Marja Novak 3 Min Read 
LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - More than 10,000 Slovenian public servants including customs officers, nurses, social workers and university professors started a one-day strike on Wednesday to demand higher wages. 
Several thousand people are expected to protest for more pay in front of the government building in the centre of Ljubljana later on Wednesday, trade unions said. 
“Although this is the fifth year of economic growth some wage restrictions imposed in 2012 have not been lifted yet. It is time to scrap all restrictions and increase wages,” said Jakob Pocivavsek, the unions’ head of strike coordination. 
He told Reuters public sector wages should rise by 16 to 20 percent over a period of time due to be determined in negotiations with the government. 
Slovenia curbed public sector wage growth in 2012 amid a severe financial crisis which ended with a bank overhaul in 2013 that enabled the country to narrowly avoid an international bailout. It returned to economic growth a year later. 
“We are trying to share the effects of economic growth as fairly as possible ... and only in the past two years the public sector wage bill was increased by 10.7 percent while the average wage rose by seven percent,” Prime Minister Miro Cerar told parliament on Monday. 
“That is why it is really hard to understand these extreme pressures of trade unions with enormous demands for more money,” he said, adding “we cannot share what we do not have”. 
The government has said unions’ demands have reached almost one billion euros (877.3 million pounds) and are unacceptable as they are not justified by productivity and economic growth and would threaten the planned fiscal consolidation. 
“If we increase the cost of labour in the public sector by one billion euros, we break macroeconomic balances. As a society we cannot survive that,” Public Administration Minister Boris Koprivnikar said. 
Policemen, nurses and teachers plan separate strikes in February unless the government agrees to raise wages by then. 
Analysts said unions have increased their demands in recent months because they hope the centre-left government may be more generous ahead of a parliamentary election due in June. 
Slovenia, a 40-billion-euro economy, expects economic expansion of 3.9 percent this year versus 4.4 percent in 2017, boosted by higher exports and investments. 
The government plans to run a budget surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP this year versus a deficit of 0.8 percent in 2017. Reporting By Marja Novak, Editing by William Maclean","On January 24, 2018, over 10,000 Slovenian public sector workers, including customs officers and nurses, initiated a one-day strike demanding wage increases of 16 to 20 percent. Thousands are expected to protest in Ljubljana. Despite a 10.7 percent rise in public sector wages over the past two years, Prime Minister Miro Cerar stated that unions' demands, totaling nearly €1 billion, are unjustified and threaten fiscal stability. Slovenia's economy, valued at €40 billion, anticipates a 3.9 percent growth in 2018, down from 4.4 percent in 2017, with a planned budget surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP."

"ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017. Fourth-quarter worldwide sales of $7.6 billion increased 42.3 percent on a reported basis and 7.7 percent on a comparable operational * basis. Reported diluted EPS from continuing operations under GAAP was a $(0.50) loss in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the net expense of $1.46 billion for the estimated 1 impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform). Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform and other specified items, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.74 in the fourth quarter, at the high end of the previous guidance range of $0.72 to $0.74.

Worldwide Medical Devices sales increased 102.2 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter. On a comparable operational basis, sales increased 9.6 percent. Refer to tables titled ""Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Comparable Historical Revenue"" for a reconciliation of comparable historical revenue. In Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, worldwide sales in the fourth quarter were led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Neuromodulation. In Electrophysiology, during the fourth quarter, Abbott initiated the U.S. launch of its Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM), the world's first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias. Growth in Structural Heart was driven by MitraClip ® , Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally-invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation.","In Q4 2017, worldwide Medical Devices sales reached $2,737 million, up 102.2% reported and 9.6% operationally. Key growth areas included Electrophysiology (16.1%), Heart Failure (11.6%), and Structural Heart (11.9%), with notable launches like the Confirm Rx ICM."
"In Heart Failure, sales growth was led by market uptake of Abbott's HeartMate 3™ system, which received U.S. FDA approval in the third quarter of 2017. In Neuromodulation, strong double-digit growth was led by several recently launched products for the treatment of chronic pain and movement disorders. In the fourth quarter, in Rhythm Management, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for MR-conditional labeling for its Quadra Assura and Quadra Assura MP cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices and its Fortify Assura implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). In Vascular, Abbott obtained CE Mark for its XIENCE Sierra drug-eluting coronary stent system, which enhances its competitive position in this category of the market. In Diabetes Care, worldwide sales increased 33.2 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter, including a favorable 5.6 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 27.6 percent on an operational basis. Strong double-digit international sales growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, Abbott's revolutionary CGM system. FreeStyle Libre is the only CGM system available that comes factory-calibrated and removes the need for routine fingersticks 3 for people with diabetes. During the fourth quarter, Abbott initiated the U.S. launch of FreeStyle Libre, and in January 2018, Abbott announced that FreeStyle Libre is now available and approved for coverage by CMS. ABBOTT ISSUES FINANCIAL OUTLOOK FOR 2018
Abbott is issuing full-year 2018 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $1.22 to $1.32. Abbott forecasts net specified items for the full year 2018 of approximately $1.58 per share.","Abbott's HeartMate 3™ system, approved in Q3 2017, drove Heart Failure sales growth. Neuromodulation saw strong double-digit growth from new chronic pain products. In Q4, Abbott received FDA approval for Quadra Assura CRT-D devices. Diabetes Care sales rose 33.2% globally, with FreeStyle Libre leading international growth. For 2018, Abbott projects diluted earnings per share of $1.22 to $1.32, with net specified items around $1.58 per share."
"Specified items include intangible amortization expense, acquisition-related expenses, charges associated with cost reduction initiatives and other expenses. Excluding specified items, projected adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would be $2.80 to $2.90 for the full year 2018. Abbott is issuing first-quarter 2018 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations under GAAP of $0.16 to $0.18. Abbott forecasts specified items for the first quarter of $0.41 per share primarily related to intangible amortization expense, acquisition-related expenses, cost reduction initiatives and other expenses. Excluding specified items, projected adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would be $0.57 to $0.59. Abbott has stated its commitment to reduce its debt levels following the recent acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere, Inc. For the full year 2017, Abbott generated operating cash flow in excess of $5.0 billion and free cash flow 4 in excess of $4.0 billion. In January 2018, Abbott repaid $4.0 billion of debt and anticipates additional debt repayments throughout 2018. ABBOTT ANNOUNCES INCREASE IN QUARTERLY DIVIDEND

Abbott's cash dividend is payable Feb. 15, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Jan. 12, 2018.","For 2018, Abbott projects adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations at $2.80 to $2.90, with first-quarter GAAP EPS guidance of $0.16 to $0.18. Specified items are estimated at $0.41 per share. In 2017, Abbott generated over $5 billion in operating cash flow and repaid $4 billion in debt."

Hyundai Motor (hyundai-motor) has invested in Singapore-based ride-hailing firm Grab (grabtaxi) , Uber’s (uber) biggest ride-hailing rival in Southeast Asia, as the South Korean automaker looks to expand beyond its traditional business of producing and selling vehicles. 
Grab did not disclose the value of Hyundai’s investment. Hyundai joined other investors, including Didi Chuxing, SoftBank and Toyota Tsusho (Toyota’s Next Technology Fund) in the latest fundraising round, Grab said. 
The two companies will work on a new mobility service platform that will use Hyundai vehicle models such as the Ioniq Electric. Ioniq is available in three electrified powertrain-hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure battery electric. 
For more on Hyundai, watch Fortune’s video: 
The strategic partnership aims to give Hyundai an inside view into what works in the so-called sharing economy that Grab is a central player in. Grab is now in eight Southeast Asian countries. 
It could also help Hyundai position itself to offer its own mobility services in one of the world’s fastest-growing markets, Southeast Asia. Hyundai is looking into several mobility services including car-sharing and ride-hailing. For instance, Hyundai partnered with WaiveCar in January 2017 to launch a car-sharing program that runs on advertising money, using IONIQ Electric model in the United State. Hyundai opened in October its first company-operated electric car sharing service in Amsterdam, Netherlands. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ","Hyundai has invested in Grab, Uber's main competitor in Southeast Asia, as part of a fundraising round with other investors like Didi Chuxing and SoftBank.

"FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone officials could pick a new European Central Bank vice president within weeks, kicking off two years of flux at the top of one of Europe’s most vital institutions and previewing a tussle to replace ECB chief Mario Draghi in 2019. Germany is seen as eager to claim the presidency at last, two decades after the ECB’s creation, but the hawkish views of its obvious candidate, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, will count against him in some member states, euro zone sources say. Also, women seem unlikely to claim either of the two top jobs in a male-dominated institution, and whatever the outcome, the reshuffle must be conducted alongside the delicate task of raising interest rates and unwinding a 2.55 trillion euro money-printing programme without provoking an upheaval on markets. Having played a leading role in fighting off the euro zone’s debt crisis, the ECB has been a pillar of the bloc’s five-year economic recovery and changes in its executive and supervisory boards could test its role as an anchor of trust in European Union institutions. Draghi relied on the ECB’s - and his own - credibility in 2012 when he promised to do ‘whatever it takes’ to preserve the euro. Then three years later he presided over the launch of the scheme to stimulate growth by flooding the financial system with cash via bond purchases. In doing this, he was arguably the key figure in holding the 19-member currency bloc together in its darkest hour. When the Italian completes his non-renewable, eight-year term in November 2019, his successor will be in the spotlight from day one. First to go at the bank will be Vice President Vitor Constancio of Portugal in May, followed next year by bank supervisor Daniele Nouy, chief economist Peter Praet, Draghi himself, and executive board member Benoit Coeure. Finance ministers will launch the process to choose a new vice president on Monday and may make a decision in February.","Euro zone officials may select a new European Central Bank (ECB) vice president within weeks, initiating two years of leadership changes ahead of Mario Draghi's 2019 departure. Germany aims for the presidency after 20 years, but Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann's hawkish stance may hinder his candidacy. The ECB, pivotal in the euro zone's recovery, manages a €2.55 trillion money-printing program while raising interest rates. Vice President Vitor Constancio will leave in May, followed by other key figures, with a decision expected in February."
"This could offer clues about political positions in the contest to replace Draghi, euro zone officials told Reuters. Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos, so far the only publicly known candidate, is favourite for the number two job. With EU spoils shared around the regions, selecting a southern European would signal that Draghi’s job will go to northern Europe, possibly Germany, the officials, who asked not to be named, said. One source noted that the chair of the euro zone finance ministers’ group has just passed to a Portuguese. “Southern Europe got the Eurogroup presidency so if they also get Constancio’s job, then Draghi’s position would have to go north to keep the regional balance,” the source said. “Then, it’s likely to be France and Germany fighting it out.” GERMANS Picking the Bundesbank chief for the ECB presidency may be tricky, even though Germany is Europe’s biggest economy and Weidmann is considered a top-notch central banker. He has alienated some officials with his opposition to the ECB’s ultra easy monetary policy, which is credited with reviving economic growth. Some regarded this as disloyalty in a time of crisis. European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi addresses a news conference at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, December 7, 2017.","Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos is the only known candidate for the ECB's number two position, with a preference for a northern European to replace Mario Draghi. The Eurogroup presidency recently passed to a Portuguese, indicating potential competition between France and Germany for Draghi's role."
"REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/Files The ECB has to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in unwinding that policy and raising rates from record lows without major dislocation. Weidmann has also ruffled some political feathers, engaging in public exchanges with former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi by criticising Rome’s performance in cutting its debt. After joining the losing side in the ECB’s biggest decisions to stimulate the economy, Weidmann could also struggle to unite the Governing Council, which rarely takes votes and strives for the broadest possible consensus. “De Guindos is a done deal (for the vice presidency),” another source said. “But while Germany might have a claim on the Draghi job, Weidmann is considered too hawkish. So some people say a German ‘yes’, but Weidmann ‘no’,” a further euro zone official said. Slideshow (3 Images) That would leave Berlin with three options: fight for Weidmann, select another German or give up the ECB and seek top jobs at the European Commission. The positions of the president, foreign policy chief and economic and monetary affairs chief all come up next year. Other Germans touted by analysts and euro zone sources as potential candidates include European Stability Mechanism managing director Klaus Regling, university professor Volker Wieland and Marcel Fratzscher, the head of economic research institute DIW Berlin. Weidmann has often said that a discussion about succession was premature and nationality should not affect the decision.","The ECB must align with the U.S. Federal Reserve in raising rates from record lows. Weidmann faces challenges uniting the Governing Council after opposing major stimulus decisions. With the ECB presidency and other key positions up for grabs in 2024, Germany may consider alternatives to Weidmann, including Klaus Regling and Volker Wieland."
"No candidate has publicly expressed interest in Draghi’s job.
FRANCE? French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a German speaker with extensive ties to Germany, is also a potential candidate to replace Draghi. Villeroy is seen as acceptable to German Chancellor Angela Merkel but France has already occupied the ECB presidency, meaning he would face an uphill battle. In a possible compromise, Dutchman Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the outgoing Eurogroup head, could also be considered, some of the sources said. Another factor is the dearth of high ranking female policymakers. Only two women serve on the 25-member rate-setting Governing Council and one of them, Sabine Lautenschlaeger, would have to quit if a fellow German replaced Draghi. This would be to avoid having two people from the same country sitting on the executive board. Lautenschlaeger, a specialist in bank regulation, could not take the top job either as under ECB rules, the president must come from outside the board on which she already sits. Possible women that may be considered for board seats include Irish central bank Deputy Governor Sharon Donnery, Italian economist Lucrezia Reichlin or France’s Sylvie Goulard. The ECB also needs a new chief economist next year with Irish central bank chief Philip Lane and Estonia’s Ardo Hansson mentioned as potential candidates.","no candidates have publicly shown interest in replacing ECB President Mario Draghi. Potential candidates include French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau and Dutchman Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Currently, only 2 of 25 Governing Council members are women, with Sabine Lautenschlaeger unable to take the top job."

"VANCOUVER, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The National Energy Board on Thursday set out a process for resolving permit disputes related to Kinder Morgan Canada’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which has faced repeated delays due to difficulty in obtaining permits.
The regulator said that under the new process it will consider future disputes between the company and provincial and municipal authorities, and provide a response within three to five weeks, providing a “measure of certainty” for all parties.
The announcement came a day after Kinder Morgan Canada, a division of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc, said the start-up of the expanded pipeline would be delayed until December 2020 due to permitting struggles.
The Trans Mountain expansion, which would nearly triple capacity to 890,000 barrels per day, is hotly opposed by environmental groups, the province of British Columbia, and some local municipalities, including the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, where the pipeline ends.
While the project has federal approvals, Burnaby last year refused to issue key construction permits, forcing Kinder Morgan to appeal to the NEB for permission to proceed with its work. The company won that appeal in December.
The NEB said it hopes the new process, which was requested by Kinder Morgan, will be used sparingly and that all participants will approach future permitting on a good faith basis, noting that the company must comply with all local laws.
Separately, the NEB said it will hold hearings in Burnaby starting next week on the final route of the expansion, which is a twinning of an existing line from Alberta’s energy heartland to the British Columbia coast. (Reporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by Tom Brown)

SYDNEY, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Australian retail sales boasted the biggest monthly rise in four years in November as consumers splashed out on Apple iPhones and Black Friday promotions, a major boost for an economy that had been struggling with sluggish spending.
The local dollar jumped a third of a U.S. cent to $0.7874 as the surprising strength helped counter concerns consumers had lapsed into a near-permanent depression.
Thursday’s figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed retail sales jumped 1.2 percent in November from October, when they rose a solid 0.5 percent. That was three times the market forecast and the steepest gain since early 2013.
Sales were up 2.9 percent on a year earlier at a record seasonally adjusted high of A$26.38 billion ($20.75 billion). Gains were led by a hefty 4.5 percent rise in household goods and a 2.2 percent increase for other retailing.
“Seasonally adjusted sales in both these industries are influenced by the release of the iPhone X and the increasing popularity of promotions in November, including Black Friday sales,” the ABS said in a note.
Consumer spending has been under pressure from record-high household debt and sluggish wage growth, one reason the Reserve Bank of Australia is in no rush to raise interest rates from record lows.
Futures markets <0#YIB;> still imply around a 50-50 chance of a hike by September and are not fully priced for a rise from 1.5 percent until February next year.
The marked revival in sales in October and November greatly improved the outlook for gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter, given household spending accounts for around 57 percent of annual economic output.
Household consumption had expanded at its slowest pace since 2008 in the third quarter, marring an otherwise respectable annual growth outcome of 2.8 percent.
THEN THERE‘S ONLINE
The retail series also showed rapid growth in online sales, which are only set to take a bigger share as Amazon set up shop late last year and is rapidly expanding its offerings.
The ABS measure showed online sales surged 22 percent in original terms in November to A$1.51 billion.
National Australia Bank (NAB) produces an online measure of its own that showed a sharp 4.7 percent rebound in sales in November, the fastest pace since late 2014.
In all, NAB estimates consumers spent A$24 billion online in the year to November, with annual growth running atop 14 percent.
Anecdotal evidence from traditional retailers still suggest they had a better December holiday season than first feared, while surveys found a marked brightening in the consumer mood.
A survey from ANZ and Roy Morgan out this week showed confidence had improved to the best since late 2013. Notably, those saying they were “better off” financially picked up to 35 percent, helping offset concerns about slow wages growth.

This surge was driven by a 4.5% rise in household goods and a 2.2% increase in other retailing, influenced by the iPhone X launch and Black Friday promotions.

MELBOURNE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Roger Federer overcame Marin Cilic 6-2 6-7(5) 6-3 3-6 6-1 in a thrilling Melbourne Park final to win a record-equalling sixth Australian Open trophy and 20th grand slam title of his glittering career. 
Federer prevailed in just over three hours under the Rod Laver Arena roof to become the third man after Roy Emerson and Novak Djokovic to claim six Australian Open titles. 
The Swiss now has four more grand slam titles than his great rival Rafael Nadal. 
Cilic, who knocked out an ailing Nadal in the quarter-finals, showed plenty of courage in his first final appearance at the event as he came from a break down in the fourth set to take the match into a deciding set. 
But despite his big hitting, he could not stop Federer from running away with the title. 
“I‘m so happy, it’s unbelievable,” Federer said with a quivering voice. 
“I‘m happy it’s over, but winning is just an absolute dream come true. The fairytale continues for me. After the great year I had last year, it’s incredible.” 
Addressing the fans, he added: “You guys make me nervous. You guys make me practice. You guys fill the stadiums. Thank you.” 
Earlier, Croatia’s Mate Pavic and Canada’s Gabriela Dabrowski beat India’s Rohan Bopanna and Timea Babos of Hungary 2-6 6-4 (11-9) to win the mixed doubles title. READ MORE

""The 2.6% level on the 10-Year is an important level which if surpassed could be detrimental for equities,"" says Stephane Ekolo, Global Equity Strategist at Avalon Capital Markets.","On January 10, 2018, European stocks fell 0.4% after reaching 2.5-year highs, driven by a bond sell-off. Rate-sensitive banks rose 2.1%, while utilities and real estate struggled. The FTSE MIB index posted a small gain. Investors are monitoring the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield, with 2.6% being a critical level that could impact equities."
"The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries has spiked today to fresh 10-month highs, to within striking distance from the 2.6% level. ""US CPI data point (this Friday at 1:30pm UK) should be closely monitored as it may provide evidence confirming the uptrend on the 10yr yield,"" adds Ekolo. (Danilo Masoni) CHRISTMAS CHEER? A MIXED BAG FOR UK RETAILERS (1606 GMT) Retailers' Christmas updates so far have been a mixed bag, Liberum analysts say, with electronics, clothing and fashion the weakest segments, although most warned of tough conditions going into 2018. Company updates and industry data alike paint a picture of weak in-store footfall being offset by strong online sales. ""What we're seeing is the disparity between the 'new-world' retailers versus the more traditional, mid-market players where the consumer proposition and service elements are not compelling or agile enough, is widening,"" they note, adding that most retailers highlighted tough conditions in 2018. What to bet on? Strong online players and value propositions, according to them - Liberum's preferences include ASOS, B&M and Boohoo, while it remains concerned about M&S, which reports Christmas trading tomorrow. Today we've had some disappointing updates from Superdry and Moss Brothers sending their shares sliding 8.8 and 16 percent respectively. But overall valuations for the UK's general retail sector have ticked up recently as some Christmas updates beat gloomy expectations.","the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries reached 2.6%, marking a 10-month high.

""If we're seeing higher growth and higher inflation, then yields should be moving higher and yield curves should be steepening, and that's exactly what we are seeing,"" Macklow-Smith says.

But no, far from it. ""The US 10y can rise all the way to 3% and we will still be in a long-term secular bull market"", he just told us.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said Friday it will investigate sexual abuse in organized sports after the sentencing of a USA Gymnastics team doctor for sexually abusing female athletes. 
The committee sent letters to USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee, Michigan State University, USA Swimming and USA Taekwondo, asking questions about sexual abuse within organized sports. Some were asked when they became aware of abuse allegations relating to the U.S. gymnastics team doctor, Larry Nassar, and answers were requested by Feb. 9. 
Nassar was sentenced in Michigan this week to up to 175 years in prison for sexually assaulting young female gymnasts. 
Separately, the U.S. Department of Education said Friday it was also investigating the Nassar abuse case. 
“What happened at Michigan State is abhorrent,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement. “The Department is investigating this matter and will hold MSU accountable for any violations of federal law.” Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Bernadette Baum","On January 26, 2018, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee announced an investigation into sexual abuse in organized sports, following Larry Nassar's sentencing to up to 175 years in prison.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Their 1977 song “Don’t Stop” helped power Bill Clinton into the White House in 1992, and on Friday it was the former U.S. president doing the honors for Fleetwood Mac.
Clinton presented Fleetwood Mac with statuettes as the 2018 MusicCares honorees, making them the first band to win the annual award given to a musician for creative achievements and charitable work.
Clinton chose the British-American band’s single “Don’t Stop” as the theme song for his 1992 presidential campaign, helping to revive their popularity and encouraging the fractious soft rock band to reunite for his inaugural ball in 1993.
“They let me use it as a theme song and I have been trying to live by it ever since,” Clinton told the audience at Radio City Music Hall in New York.
“I owe a great deal to all of them,” he added.
At the concert and ceremony on Friday, Miley Cyrus, Lorde, Keith Urban, Harry Styles and Juanes were among musicians across genres to perform their own interpretations of Fleetwood Mac’s biggest hits over a 50-year career.
Band members Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham ended the three-hour celebration by taking to the stage to perform “Go Your Own Way” and “Little Lies.”

After romantic and creative tensions, some members going solo and several changes of line-up, Fleetwood, McVie, Nicks, Buckingham and Christine McVie put their differences behind them and reunited in 2014 for the first time since 1998, and embarked on a sell-out world tour.

“But what we are feeling really more now than ever in our career is love,” he added.
Proceeds from the annual MusiCares gala support members of the music industry in times of financial and medical need.
Friday’s event, held two days before the Grammy Awards, raised some $7 million for MusiCares, Recording Academy chairman Neil Portnow said.
Previous recipients include Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney.

"ROME (Reuters) - Italy will ask European authorities to reconsider whether the European Medicines Authority (EMA) could be moved to Milan after Brexit, in light of concerns about its planned move to Amsterdam, an Italian government source said on Monday.
Milan lost out when the new destination for the authority, which must leave its current home in London when Britain leaves the European Union, was decided by drawing lots in November.
But in light of concerns raised by Executive Director Guido Rasi on Monday about the temporary space available in Amsterdam, Italy would try again for the chance to host the agency, the source said.
“The government will take all appropriate action with the European Commission and the relevant authorities to make sure that ... the decision by which Milan lost out at the draw is (reconsidered),” he said.
Rasi said his organization had little choice other than to accept a temporary Amsterdam base with half the space of its London offices as it rushes to relocate ahead of Britain’s March 2019 exit from the EU.
The Dutch health ministry specified in a separate statement EMA will occupy the “Spark” building in western Amsterdam during 2019, ahead of the scheduled completion of a new, building to house the EMA in south Amsterdam starting in 2020.

Hikvision has repeatedly said its devices are safe and secure and the company hasn’t been accused of using its devices to spy 
By Dan Strumpf 
The U.S. Army said it removed surveillance cameras made by a Chinese state-backed manufacturer from a domestic military base, while a congressional committee plans to hold a hearing this month into whether small businesses face cybersecurity risks from using the equipment. 
Fort Leonard Wood, an Army base in Missouri’s Ozarks, replaced five cameras on the base branded and made by Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., said Col. Christopher Beck, the base’s chief of staff. He said officials at the base acted after reading media reports about the company. 
“We never believed [the cameras] were a security risk. They were always on a closed network,” Col. Beck said. The decision to replace the cameras was meant to “remove any negative perception” surrounding them following media reports, he added, without elaborating. 
A Wall Street Journal article in November highlighted the prevalence in the U.S. of devices made by Hikvision , the world’s largest maker of surveillance cameras, which is 42% owned by the Chinese government. The Journal reported that some security-system vendors in the U.S. refuse to carry Hikvision cameras or place restrictions on their purchase, concerned they could be used by Beijing to spy on Americans. 
A Hikvision spokeswoman said the company “believes the products it builds and distributes around the world must meet the highest standards of not only quality but also security. We stand by our products and processes.” 
A Defense Department spokesman said the Hikvision cameras at Fort Leonard Wood weren’t connected to the military network. He said the department is conducting a review of all network-connected cameras on the base to ensure they are “in compliance with all security updates.” The spokesman declined to comment on whether Hikvision cameras are in use at other military facilities.","On January 12, 2018, the U.S. Army removed five surveillance cameras made by Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. from Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, due to concerns raised by media reports.

" 49 AM / Updated 4 minutes ago Barca visit thrill-seeking Betis after ending unbeaten run Richard Martin 3 Min Read 
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Barcelona have had their confidence trimmed by Espanyol snapping their 29-game unbeaten run in all competitions with a surprise win in the King’s Cup, and the runaway Liga leaders will be put to the test again on Sunday against thrill seekers Real Betis. 
Only Barca and high-flying Valencia have scored more goals than Betis, who have garnered a reputation as one of the most exciting teams in the league this season under attacking ideologue Quique Setien. 
The former Las Palmas coach’s open approach has had dire consequences for his side’s defence, however, which is the third worst in the league, with only basement club Las Palmas and 18th-placed Deportivo La Coruna shipping more goals than them. 
Betsy won a wild local derby at fierce rivals Sevilla 5-3 at the start of the month, while earlier this season their swashbuckling style saw them lose 6-3 to Valencia and draw 4-4 with Real Sociedad. 
Their last outing was a thrilling 3-2 win over Leganes in which they threw away a two-goal lead before returning hero Ruben Castro came off the bench to strike the winning penalty in his first game back at the club. 
Barca have been accused of uninspiring football on occasion this season but last week turned on the style to come from two goals down to beat Real Sociedad 4-2, ending an 11-year hoodoo away to the Basque club and preserving their nine-point lead at the top of the standings. 
Despite the danger posed by Barca, Setien ruled out a cautious approach from Betis against the Catalans and also said he would not instruct his players to man-mark Lionel Messi. 
“Barcelona are a very difficult team to face, we have some doubts, but we’re going to be brave against them, we’re sure of that,” the coach told radio station Cadena Ser. 
”Our destiny is to play, to press them high and rob the ball off them in their half, and as long as they will permit us, to try and cause them problems in their area. 
Betis captain Joaquin added: “They have every move programmed and they play so perfectly that it’s going to be very difficult, but we’re going to die with our philosophy and we’re going to try and cause them problems.” 
There was little sign of alarm among Barca players after they lost 1-0 to Espanyol in the first leg of their Cup quarterfinal to an 88th minute winner from Oscar Melendo after Messi had a penalty saved. 
“If you could choose a day to lose, it might have been today,” defender Gerard Pique said after Barca’s first defeat in any competition since August.

However, Betis has the league's third-worst defense, conceding more goals than only Las Palmas and Deportivo La Coruna. Recent matches include a thrilling 5-3 win over Sevilla and a 3-2 victory against Leganes. Barcelona, maintaining a nine-point lead in La Liga, recently overcame Real Sociedad 4-2, ending an 11-year winless streak at their ground."

"January 21, 2018 / 6:28 AM / in 6 hours Snowboarding: Veteran Clark joins newcomer Kim on U.S. team Rory Carroll 3 Min Read 
MAMMOTH, California (Reuters) - Veteran Kelly Clark qualified for her fifth Olympic Games on Saturday by winning the snowboarding halfpipe competition at the U.S. Grand Prix in Mammoth, edging out fellow American and celebrated newcomer Chloe Kim. 
“It never gets old and it never gets easy,” Clark told a crowd assembled for the team-naming ceremony after the competition. 
“This is one of the greatest privileges of my life.” 
Clark, the most decorated women’s snowboarder of all time, scored an 89 on her first of three trips down the halfpipe. 
The 17-year-old Kim, who has called the 34-year-old Clark a mentor, scored an 87 on her second run but was unable to catch Clark. 
Kim had already secured her spot on the U.S. team prior to Saturday’s competition and did not attempt some of the more challenging tricks that have made her a favorite to win gold in Pyeongchang next month. 
Korean-American Kim said getting the chance to compete in South Korea for this first Olympics added an extra layer of excitement. 
“I have family in Korea as well so this has a special meaning to me,” she said. “I am really excited for these next couple months. I think it will be a good time.” 
Clark and Kim will be joined by 17-year-old Maddie Mastro, who finished third, with the fourth spot yet to be determined, but is likely go to 21-year-old Arielle Gold. 
Chase Josey scored an impressive 94.5 on his first run to win his first Grand Prix and make a strong case to be given the fourth spot on the U.S. men’s snowboarding team for Pyeongchang. 
Ben Ferguson, Shaun White and Jake Pates had all already qualified. 
Only Ferguson competed on Saturday, looking explosive on the course but finishing second to the 22-year-old Josey. 
Two-time gold medalist White had been expected to compete on Saturday but withdrew due to illness. 
White booked his ticket to Pyeongchang last weekend when he scored a perfect 100 to win at the U.S. Grand Prix in Snowmass, Colorado. 
White was on hand for the competition on Saturday and said his enthusiasm was running high ahead of his fourth Olympics. 
“I am so excited because it is not easy,” he told a press conference. “I‘m pumped.” 
A scary moment came when veteran American Danny Davis crashed toward the end of his second run, landing hard on his back at the top of the railing before skidding to the halfpipe floor. 
After being treated by medical staff for several minutes he walked off unaided, earning loud applause from the crowd.

"HONG KONG, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Esprit Holdings Ltd said it expected to post losses in the fiscal first half, ended in December 2017, hit by weak sales at its brick-and-mortar retail stores as the fashion group rationalized its distribution footprint and a decline in China business.
The Europe-focused clothing retailer expected to post a net loss of up to HK$980 million ($125.4 million) for July-December period, as compared with HK$61 million profit in the year-ago period, the company said in a filing late on Wednesday.
Esprit said its gross profit margin had slightly increased and operating expenses had further reduced, but were not sufficient to outweigh the negative impact of the revenue decline during the period.
The operating environment continues to be “very challenging” amid the rapidly-changing industry dynamics, and the financial performance in the second half remains “uncertain”, the company added. It is due to release the interim results on Feb. 28.
Esprit is undergoing a multi-year revamp that includes store closures, price adjustments, new return policies, and technology and distribution upgrades.
It said in November it would continue downsizing effort to accelerate closure of loss-making retail stores and expect improvement in gross profit margin and operating expenses to outweigh the negative impact of revenue decline.
The company has expected controlled retail space to shrink by single digits in percentage terms in the current financial year with falling revenue.
Esprit shares dived more than 15 percent in early trade at HK$3.44, their lowest since April 1999.

"* Demonetisation, tax increase hit consumption -Morgan Stanley
* 2018 fuel demand outlook to improve -Trifecta
* Indian car sales pick up but still far below China’s
By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Indian oil consumption in 2017 grew at its slowest in four years, according to government statistics, hit by the government’s demonetisation move and a tax increase that knocked the gain in fuel use back to a modest 2.3 percent.
The low growth also coincided with another year of weak, albeit improving, new vehicle sales.
Last year’s oil demand was held back “by headwinds from demonetisation and a new goods and services tax,” U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.
India imports almost all of its oil, shipping in around 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in 2017, according to trade flow data in Thomson Reuters Eikon.
“Gasoline demand rose 7.4 percent, or 41,000 barrels per day, down from 12 percent growth in 2016 as demand was affected by demonetisation at the start of the year,” the bank said.
India in late 2016 pulled all 500- and 1,000-rupee notes out of circulation, crimping retail and wholesale markets.
“The demonetization exercise hit consumption, particularly in the first half of 2017. We are likely to see better growth this year,” said Sukrit Vijayakar, director at Indian energy consultancy Trifecta.
India also saw some structural demand changes that affected the use of refined oil products.
A government push for household to use more liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) has India challenging China as the world’s top LPG importer.
This has come at the cost of a straight 15-month decline in jet fuel and kerosene demand in India, Morgan Stanley said.
Also, “naphtha demand ... was down 8 percent for 2017 as a whole, possibly driven by more LPG use in petrochemicals,” it said.
SLOW CAR SALES India’s slow oil demand growth has surprised many, given the country has often been touted as the next China in terms of rising oil consumption.
Yet the oil demand figures correlate with slow growth in a related field: car sales.
India’s new passenger car sales in 2017 likely approached 3 million for the first time and outgrew a record hit in 2012.
The figure, though, remains far below China’s new car sales, which stand at almost 3 million a month.
The low auto sales are partly explained by India’s annual per capita gross domestic product (GDP) being merely a fifth of China‘s. Fuels at Indian petrol stations are also much more expensive.
If an Indian citizen with an average salary buys 10 gallons of gasoline per month, that would represent nearly 30 percent of the person’s income, while the average Chinese would fork out just 5 percent, data from statistics company Numbeo showed.
However, India’s lacklustre auto sales may pick-up as its economy continues to grow strongly, at over 6 percent per year .
Trifecta’s Vijayakar said car and motorbike sales in India “have shown good growth in the last few months ... (and) should be better this year.”

"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Children’s clothes bearing the slogan ‘Slavery gets shit done’ have been pulled from sale by online retail giant Amazon.com Inc after criticism from shoppers and anti-slavery groups.
A range of products featuring the slogan, from mugs and bags to T-shirts modeled by young children, were listed by third-party sellers and have been removed from sale, Amazon said.
“All Marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don’t will be subject to action including potential removal of their account,” an Amazon spokesman said in a statement. “The products in question are no longer available.”
While the slavery-themed products are no longer available to buy on Amazon’s UK website, bags bearing the slogan were still on sale on the U.S.-based Amazon.com on Monday.
The sale of such items by a major retailer trivializes the global drive to end modern slavery, said charities Anti-Slavery International (ASI) and International Justice Mission (IJM) UK.
“If it is meant to be funny, it fails miserably,” Jakub Sobik of ASI told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.
More than 40 million people were living as modern slaves last year - either trapped in forced labor or forced marriages - according to the United Nations International Labour Organization (ILO) and human rights group Walk Free Foundation.
“Children the same age as those modeling the T-shirts will be forced to work long hours for no pay in desperate conditions where starvation, beatings and sleep deprivation are common,” said David Westlake, chief executive of IJM UK.
“Rather than trivializing slavery, companies and the global community must recognize the vast injustice of modern slavery and work together to end it for good,” he added.
The imagery linked to slavery, and the issues it raises over history and identity, has stirred increasing debate with deep division over the fate of slavery-era statues in the United States, and worldwide outrage about slogans and pictures used by big brands.
British supermarket Waitrose this month pulled a brand of coffee off its shelves after shoppers noticed the packaging featured images of 19th-century slaves working on plantations.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's controversial EU Withdrawal Bill is set to complete its first journey through parliament's lower house with a vote some time after 1900 GMT today , marking a major legal step on the way to Brexit. Despite its wafer-thin majority, the government is likely to be able to get the bill through, meaning it then passes to the largely pro-EU upper chamber House of Lords for more scrutiny. Calls for a second referendum on Brexit have grown this month, and EU leaders insist Britain is welcome to stay in the EU if it changes its mind ; but Theresa May's government reaffirmed on Monday it is determined to see Brexit through. The new Catalan parliament meets for the first time today with the task of electing its governing body and its speaker. It also triggers a 10-day deadline for Catalan leader-in-exile Carles Puigdemont to say whether he plans to come back to the region and face arrest for sedition and rebellion. Some of his backers have suggested he could try and rule Catalonia by Skype - an unprecedented arrangement which the Spanish government in Madrid has said it would contest in the courts. Further east, two sagas of politics and graft are reaching a head. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who is battling allegations of EU subsidy fraud, saw his minority government lose a confidence vote on Tuesday , which means he must now try to cut a deal with opposition parties to stay in office.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New security upgrades to the U.S. refugee admissions programme will help block suspected criminals from entering the United States from “high-risk” countries, the head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Monday.
“We will be rolling out new security measures for applicants from high-risk countries which will seek to prevent the programme from being exploited by terrorists, criminals and fraudsters,” U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said at a public event in Washington.
“These changes will not only improve security but importantly they will help us better assess legitimate refugees fleeing persecution.”
Nielsen did not give further details about the upgrade.
Since taking office, President Donald Trump has slashed the number of refugees allowed into the country and paused the refugee programme for four months last year. He has also instituted stricter vetting requirements and quit negotiations on a voluntary pact to deal with global migration.
In late October, the Trump administration effectively paused refugee admissions from 11 countries mostly in the Middle East and Africa, pending a 90-day security review which was set to expire last week.
The countries subject to the review are Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It is unclear if these are the same “high-risk” countries referred to by Nielsen.
For each of the last three years, refugees from the 11 countries made up more than 40 percent of U.S. admissions. But a Reuters review of State Department data shows that as the 90-day review went into effect, refugee admissions from the 11 countries plummeted.
On Dec. 23, a federal judge in Seattle partially blocked restrictions on admitting refugees from the 11 countries, saying the administration could carry out the 90-day review, but could not stop processing or admitting refugees from the 11 countries in the meantime, as long as those refugees had significant ties to the United States.
Since the judge’s ruling, 23 refugees from the 11 countries have been allowed into the United States, according to State Department data.

"CATSKILL, N.Y., Jan. 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --
Greene County Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:GCBC), the holding company for The Bank of Greene County and its subsidiary Greene County Commercial Bank, today reported net income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, which is the second quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. Net income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 was $3.6 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share, and $7.1 million, or $0.84 per basic and $0.83 per diluted share, respectively, as compared to $2.9 million, or $0.34 per basic and diluted share, and $5.4 million, or $0.64 per basic and diluted share, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Net income increased $714,000, or 24.4%, when comparing the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and increased $1.7 million, or 30.9%, when comparing the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of $251,000. The impact to earnings per share was a positive $0.03 per share for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017. Donald Gibson, President & CEO, stated, “I am pleased to report solid performance for both the three months and six months ended December 31, 2017. The earning performance was driven by the steady measured growth of our balance sheet across all three of our primary banking lines - retail, commercial, and municipal. I believe our success is continued evidence that our long term strategy which is focused on community and customer relationships has been successful.” Gibson continued, “I am also pleased to report that we completed the renovations and opened our full-service branch in Copake, NY during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. This represents our first branch in Eastern Columbia County and has been extremely well received.”
Selected highlights for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 are as follows:
Net Interest Income and Margin
Net interest income increased $729,000 to $8.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $7.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.","Greene County Bancorp, Inc. reported net income of $3.6 million ($0.43 per share) for Q2 FY 2018, up from $2.9 million ($0.34 per share) in Q2 FY 2017, marking a 24.4% increase. For the six months, net income rose to $7.1 million ($0.84 per basic share) from $5.4 million ($0.64 per basic share), a 30.9% increase. Net interest income also grew by $729,000 to $8.5 million. The company opened its first full-service branch in Copake, NY, enhancing its community presence."
"Net interest income increased $1.8 million to $16.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from $14.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. These increases in net interest income were primarily the result of the growth in the average interest-earning asset balances. This was partially offset by a lower yield on securities. The lower yield on securities is the result of a decrease in prepayment penalty income on mortgage-backed securities, included in interest income, of $355,000 when comparing the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and $256,000 when comparing the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Net interest spread decreased 23 basis points to 3.21% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.44% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net interest spread decreased 11 basis points to 3.24% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.35% for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Net interest margin decreased 21 basis points to 3.29% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.50% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net interest margin decreased 10 basis points to 3.32% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.42% for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis includes the additional amount of interest income that would have been earned if the Company’s investment in tax-exempt securities and loans had been subject to federal and New York State income taxes yielding the same after-tax income. Tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.50% and 3.75% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.","For the six months ending December 31, 2017, net interest income rose by $1.8 million to $16.6 million, up from $14.8 million in 2016. The net interest spread decreased by 11 basis points to 3.24%, while the net interest margin fell by 10 basis points to 3.32%. Additionally, prepayment penalty income on mortgage-backed securities dropped by $256,000 year-over-year. Tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.50% for Q4 2017, down from 3.75% in Q4 2016."
"Tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.53% and 3.67% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Tax equivalent net interest margin for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 has been adjusted to reflect the Federal blended statutory tax rate applicable to our fiscal year 2018 of 28.1% resulting from the TCJA. As a result of utilizing this lower statutory tax rate for the periods ended December 31, 2017, the tax equivalent net interest margin decreased six basis points for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2017. Asset Quality and Loan Loss Provision
Provision for loan losses amounted to $352,000 and $586,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The provision for loan losses amounted to $699,000 and $1.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the provision for loan loss for the period is the result of slower growth in average loan balances. Allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable decreased to 1.68% as of December 31, 2017 as compared to 1.74% as of June 30, 2017, and 1.73% as of December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs amounted to $98,000 and $141,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and amounted to $369,000 and $193,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in net charges-offs for the six months is due to the charge-off of two commercial loans during the period. There were no commercial loan charge-offs during the six months ended December 31, 2016.","For the six months ended December 31, 2017, the tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.53%, down six basis points from 3.67% in 2016. Provision for loan losses decreased to $699,000 from $1.1 million, with net charge-offs rising to $369,000 from $193,000. The allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable was 1.68%, down from 1.73% in 2016."
"Nonperforming loans amounted to $3.7 million and $3.6 million at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively, nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.43% and 0.45% and nonperforming loans to net loans were 0.55% and 0.58%. At December 31, 2016, nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.45% and nonperforming loans to net loans were 0.65%. Noninterest Income and Noninterest Expense
Noninterest income increased $275,000, or 17.1%, to $1.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Noninterest income increased $466,000, or 14.7%, to $3.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $3.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. These increases are primarily due to increases in debit card fees and service charges on deposit accounts resulting from continued growth in the number of checking accounts with debit cards, as well as increased monthly or transactional service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expense increased $524,000, or 10.9%, to $5.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $4.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Noninterest expense increased $663,000, or 7.0%, to $10.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $9.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. These increases in noninterest expense are primarily the result of an increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses, resulting from additional staffing to support the Bank’s growth. New positions were added within the Bank’s lending department, customer service center, investment center and for the Bank’s new branch in Copake, New York.","As of December 31, 2017, nonperforming loans were $3.7 million, with nonperforming assets to total assets at 0.43% and nonperforming loans to net loans at 0.55%. Noninterest income rose by $275,000 (17.1%) to $1.9 million for Q4 2017, and by $466,000 (14.7%) to $3.6 million for the first half of 2017. Noninterest expense increased by $524,000 (10.9%) to $5.3 million for Q4 2017, driven by staffing growth."
"The increase is also due to higher service and data processing fees resulting from costs associated with offering more services to customers through online banking. Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes directly reflects the expected tax associated with the pre-tax income generated for the given year and certain regulatory requirements. The effective tax rate was 22.3% and 24.0% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively compared to 26.3% and 25.7% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 is primarily the result of a net tax benefit of $251,000 recognized at December 31, 2017 as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) in December 2017. The effective tax rate decreased from 27.6% to 22.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and decreased from 26.6% to 24.0% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 as a result of this adjustment. TCJA permanently reduces the maximum corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The lower corporate income tax rate means that deferred tax assets and liabilities that will be deductible or taxable in the future would need to be computed at the new tax rate. Additionally, fiscal year-end taxpayers such as Greene County Bancorp, Inc. are required to utilize a “blended rate” in calculating the effective tax rate for the fiscal year based on a ratio utilizing the number of days at the 35% tax rate and the number of days at the 21% tax rate. Greene County Bancorp, Inc.’s statutory blended rate for fiscal 2018 is approximately 28%. This statutory rate is impacted by the benefits derived from tax-exempt bond and loan income, the Company’s real estate investment trust subsidiary income, as well as the tax benefit derived from premiums paid to the Company’s pooled captive insurance subsidiary to arrive at the effective tax rate.","As of December 31, 2017, the effective tax rates for Greene County Bancorp, Inc. were 22.3% for three months and 24.0% for six months, down from 26.3% and 25.7% in 2016, respectively. This decrease was influenced by a net tax benefit of $251,000 due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The maximum corporate tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a statutory blended rate of approximately 28% for fiscal 2018."
"Balance Sheet Summary
Total assets of the Company were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017 as compared to $982.3 million at June 30, 2017, an increase of $78.5 million, or 8.0%. This growth is the result of the continued expansion within our existing markets, across all three of our primary banking lines - retail, commercial, and municipal. Securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity increased $26.8 million, or 8.5%, to $342.1 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $315.3 million at June 30, 2017. Securities purchases totaled $74.8 million during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and consisted of $62.1 million of state and political subdivision securities, $10.4 million of mortgage backed securities, and $2.3 million of U.S. government sponsored enterprises securities. Principal pay-downs and maturities during the six months amounted to $47.1 million, of which $9.2 million were mortgage-backed securities, $36.4 million were state and political subdivision securities, and $1.5 million were corporate debt securities. Net loans receivable increased $39.7 million, or 6.4%, to $663.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $624.2 million at June 30, 2017. The loan growth experienced during the six month period consisted primarily of $10.8 million in commercial real estate loans (including commercial construction loans), $17.8 million in commercial loans, $4.5 million in multi-family real estate loans, and $6.7 million in residential real estate loans. Total deposits increased to $920.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $859.5 million at June 30, 2017, an increase of $61.3 million, or 7.1%. NOW deposits increased $59.5 million, or 15.2%, money market deposits increased $2.0 million, or 1.7%, savings deposits increased $8.1 million, or 4.1% and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $3.4 million, or 3.6% when comparing December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit of $11.9 million, or 22.2%, when comparing December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017.","As of December 31, 2017, total assets reached $1.1 billion, up $78.5 million (8.0%) from $982.3 million on June 30, 2017.

Total deposits grew by $61.3 million (7.1%) to $920.8 million, with NOW deposits up $59.5 million (15.2%). Certificates of deposit fell by $11.9 million (22.2%) during the same period."
"These increases were the result of a $39.9 million increase in municipal deposits at Greene County Commercial Bank, primarily from continued growth in new account relationships as well as tax collection. Included within certificates of deposits at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 were $3.9 million and $15.0 million, respectively, in brokered certificates of deposit. Borrowings amounted to $20.3 million of overnight and $20.2 million of long-term borrowings, with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York at December 31, 2017, compared to $6.9 million of overnight borrowings and $22.7 million of term borrowings at June 30, 2017. Shareholders’ equity increased to $89.6 million at December 31, 2017 from $83.5 million at June 30, 2017, as net income of $7.1 million was partially offset by a $322,000 increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss and dividends declared and paid of $763,000. Other changes in equity, an increase of $25,000, were the result of options exercised with the Company’s 2008 Stock Option Plan. Included in accumulated other comprehensive income is $259,000 which represents the stranded credit resulting from the change in Federal tax rates upon the enactment of the TCJA and its impact on deferred taxes associated with items reported in accumulated other comprehensive income.

"TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bentall Kennedy is pleased to announce the appointment of Anna Murray, Vice President of Sustainability, to the Investment Committee of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). As Bentall Kennedy’s representative, Anna Murray will Co-Chair the Property Working Group of the UNEP FI, with a global mandate to drive adoption of sustainability in real estate investment and property management. The UNEP FI was created at the conclusion of the 1992 Earth Summit and now includes membership from more than 200 global financial institutions, including banks, insurers and investors.

As a member of the Investment Committee, Murray will share responsibility for developing and monitoring the UNEP FI sustainability strategy for the investment industry and engaging with leading global investors to address pressing sustainability issues.
“With buildings accounting for approximately one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions and consuming 40 per cent of global energy, there is an incredible opportunity to reduce the real estate industry’s overall environmental footprint,” said Murray. “I am honored to represent Bentall Kennedy to help lead a global movement for sustainability, climate change action, and environmental progress that strengthens the long-term value generation and competitiveness of commercial real estate.”
UNEP FI’s work also includes a strong focus on policy – by stimulating country-level dialogues between finance practitioners, supervisors, regulators and policy-makers, and, at the international level, by promoting financial sector involvement in processes such as the global climate negotiations.
“In the buildings sector alone, meeting the Paris commitments will require in the region of USD 300 billion annually by 2020 just for financing energy efficiency retrofits,” said Eric Usher, Head of the UNEP FI. “The UNEP FI Property Working Group works to address and contribute to the most imminent challenges in the field of sustainable real estate investment, and for many years Bentall Kennedy has helped steer that course of innovation within our initiative. We welcome Anna Murray on the UNEP FI Investment Committee and look forward to growing and strengthening sustainable real estate investment in North America.”

"We are more than a quarter through earnings season, with another 120 companies reporting this week. On the surface, the news could not be better: Earnings are growing faster than anyone anticipated even a few months ago, even heading into the first quarter of 2018.
But we may finally be seeing a visible catalyst for a pullback. As the 10-year Treasury yield has passed 2.7 percent, traders have been getting nervous. Rates moved up 5 basis points over the weekend on not much news.
It's not just the level of rates, it's also the velocity of the moves. The market has shown it does not react positively if rates move too quickly.
Strategists have taken note: Stifel, in a note this morning, said ""We see a 5+ percent S&P 500 correction in Q1 2018 as yields rise abruptly to reflect growth as well as inflation, and central banks pursue a more coordinated and multi-lateral exit from increasingly risky rate suppression.""
This means that in a week filled with potentially market-moving news (State of the Union address, the biggest earnings week of the quarter, the December jobs report) the single biggest most likely market-moving news will come from the Fed meeting on Wednesday.
With rates moving this fast, it wouldn't take much to move the markets, and convince traders that we are in for at least four rates hikes this year, not three — and possibly more.
""If the FOMC acknowledges the U.S. economy continues to gain momentum as the labor market slack shrinks further as well as comment that market-based measures of inflation expectations, (i.e. 10Y TIPS breakeven rate) is moving higher, that will further fuel bond bears and support in their call for four rate hikes instead of three,"" Adrian Miller, an independent bond analyst, wrote to me this morning.
Traders are already looking at signs inflation might be picking up. They include a pickup in wages (Goldman's Jan Hatzius expects average hourly earnings to grow 3 percent to 3.5 percent in 2018), better than expected economic numbers (the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, a measure of how much economic forecasts are exceeding estimates, is near its highest level ever) and an 8 percent gain in the last month in the price of gold, a traditional hedge against inflation. That is a near-18 month high.
So, why isn't the market reacting even more to these concerns? After all, everyone knows the biggest killers of market rallies have been recessions and sudden spikes in interest rates.
The answer is in the tidal wave of higher earnings. More companies are 1) beating estimates, 2) beating by wider margins, and 3) seeing estimates continue to rise into the first quarter.
Let's start with the companies beating estimates. According to Thomson Reuters, 79.7 percent of companies reporting so far are beating earnings estimates in the fourth quarter. That is way above the historic trend of 64 percent. And 82 percent are beating revenue estimates, way above the 60 percent that historically beat expectations.
Another important trend: They are beating by wider margins than normal. Take today's earnings news — Seagate Technology and Lockheed Martin . Seagate reported earnings 9 percent above expectations, while Lockheed Martin reported earnings about 6 percent above expectations.
So far, earnings have been 4.6 percent above expectations, versus a long-term historical norm of 3.1 percent.
Finally, the numbers are continuing to rise in the first quarter.
Q1 2018 S&P 500 Earnings 

Earnings: up 16.7 percent
Revenue: up 7.3 percent

Source: Thomson Reuters 
These numbers traditionally go up through the quarter, and then come down in the final weeks as analysts get greater clarity. But that did not happen in the fourth quarter. The numbers rose into the end of the year, and there is a good chance they will not drop appreciably in this quarter.
With numbers like these, it's not hard to understand why traders are reluctant to dump such a hot hand.","earnings season is underway with 120 companies reporting this week, showing unexpected growth. Currently, 79.7% of companies are beating earnings estimates, significantly above the historical average of 64%, while 82% are surpassing revenue estimates compared to the typical 60%. Earnings are averaging 4.6% above expectations, exceeding the long-term norm of 3.1%. For Q1 2018, S&P 500 earnings are projected to rise by 16.7%, with revenues increasing by 7.3%. However, concerns are mounting as the 10-year Treasury yield has surpassed 2.7%, prompting fears of a potential 5% correction in the S&P 500. Analysts predict at least four rate hikes this year, influenced by rising inflation indicators, including a 3-3.5% increase in average hourly earnings and an 8% rise in gold prices, a traditional inflation hedge. Despite these concerns, the strong earnings performance is keeping traders optimistic."
" 14 AM / Updated 4 minutes ago UPDATE 1-China's Leshi flags $1.8 bln annual loss, cites LeEco cash crunch Reuters Staff 
* Leshi’s loss includes 7.9 bln yuan of provisions 
* Jia Yueting is Leshi’s largest shareholder; Sunac 2nd biggest 
* Leshi, Sunac shares slide after loss announcement (Adds details from Leshi statement, Sunac share move) 
By Sijia Jiang 
HONG KONG, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Chinese video-streaming firm Leshi Internet flagged a net loss of 11.6 billion yuan ($1.83 billion) for 2017, its first annual loss as a listed firm, citing a cash crunch at its founder Jia Yueting’s embattled technology conglomerate LeEco. 
Leshi Internet Information & Technology announced the estimated loss - which is more than five times its combined profits since listing on the Shenzhen stock exchange in 2010 - in a statement late on Tuesday. 
The loss included 4.4 billion yuan of bad debt reserve for account receivables from LeEco units and 3.5 billion yuan of asset devaluation provision, it said. 
The magnitude of the loss shows the aftermath of the debt-fuelled expansion of LeEco, a Netflix-to-Tesla-like group that has struggled to meet its obligations since Jia admitted to a cash crunch in late 2016. It also adds pressure on Jia, who has defied Chinese regulators’ orders to return from the United States, where he has been based since the summer. 
Jia resigned as chairman and CEO from Leshi after property developer Sunac China made a $2 billion investment last year in Leshi to become its second-largest shareholder. But he remains Leshi’s largest shareholder with a 25.67 percent stake, though most of that has been pledged to financial institutions. 
Leshi, which makes internet-connected TVs and produces video entertainment, was deeply intertwined with LeEco units for related transactions but is increasingly trying to distance itself from the conglomerate. 
With loans and financial liabilities of around $1.5 billion, Leshi said last week it is seeking equity stakes in the car businesses of Jia, including Faraday Future, for debts owed by him and LeEco units totalling 7.5 billion yuan. LeEco has disputed that figure. 
LeEco did not immediately respond to an emailed request for a comment. 
Leshi is due to report 2017 results on April 24. 
Its shares plunged by the daily limit of 10 percent on Wednesday, the sixth consecutive day they have tumbled the maximum allowed since resuming trading a week ago following a nine-month suspension. 
Shares of Sunac China dropped as much as 5.4 percent in Hong Kong on Wednesday morning before recouping the loss by noon.

Leshi's largest shareholder, Jia Yueting, holds a 25.67% stake, while Sunac China is the second-largest shareholder after a $2 billion investment. Leshi's shares fell by the daily limit of 10% for six consecutive days, reflecting the financial turmoil linked to its parent company, LeEco."

"TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Chinese carrier group has sailed through the narrow Taiwan Strait that separates the self-ruled island from its giant neighbour but no unusual activity was detected, Taiwan said on Wednesday, amid heightened tension with Beijing.
Beijing has taken an increasingly hostile stance towards Taiwan since the election two years ago of President Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.
China suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, though she has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.
In recent months, China has stepped up military drills around Taiwan, alarming Taipei. China says the exercises are routine, but that it will not tolerate any attempt by the island to declare independence.
Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said a group of Chinese ships led by the Liaoning aircraft carrier entered the southwestern part of the Taiwan Strait in the early hours of Tuesday, though it stayed on the Chinese side of the waterway.
As of midday on Wednesday the carrier group had left Taiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone heading in a northerly direction, the ministry said, adding it had monitored the group’s movements throughout.
“While the group was passing through the Taiwan Strait there were no abnormal activities, and people can rest easy,” it added.
China’s Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the Soviet-era Liaoning, China’s first aircraft carrier, has passed through the Taiwan Strait before on its way to and from exercises in the South China Sea.
While heavily travelled by commercial shipping and flights, the Taiwan Strait is also a sensitive military zone.
This month, Taiwan complained about China launching a new air route for civilian flights that runs close to two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands off the Chinese coast in the strait, saying it threatened regional security and aviation safety.
China does not need Taiwan’s permission to open new air routes, a government spokesman said on Wednesday, denying there was a safety risk.
Taiwan said on Friday the new flight path was so close to the middle line of the Taiwan Strait that it would affect Taiwan air force exercises and other flight operations.
“The planes can come very close to each other,” an official added, referring to other connecting routes that China has opened and where Taiwan civilian flights already operate.
“It becomes a very dangerous situation if we do not consult with each other.”
China, which considers Taiwan a wayward province, snapped official communication with its government after Tsai took office.

This comes amid heightened tensions since President Tsai Ing-wen's election two years ago, as China increases military drills around Taiwan. The Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier, has previously traversed the strait. Taiwan also raised concerns over a new Chinese air route near its controlled islands, claiming it threatens regional security.

Trump, speaking at the start of a cabinet meeting, said he wanted to see action to help those affected by his decision to rescind the so-called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which enabled some undocumented people who came into the United States as children to remain temporarily.
“We want to see something happen with DACA. It’s been spoken of for years, and children are now adults in many cases,” Trump said, noting that hundreds of thousands of people were affected by the policy.

"January 23, 2018 / 11:34 AM / Updated 10 minutes ago Last major challenger to Egypt's Sisi calls off campaign after arrest Reuters Staff 4 Min Read 
CAIRO (Reuters) - The last challenger seen as a potential threat to the re-election of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was detained on Tuesday, and halted his campaign after the army accused him of breaking the law by running for office without permission. 
Former military chief of staff Lieutenant General Sami Anan, who had announced his candidacy last week, was taken to the Military Prosecutor’s office in Cairo, according to his son and one of his lawyers, who were waiting outside the building. 
An army statement read on state TV said Anan’s presidential bid amounted to “a serious breach of the laws of military service”, because as a military officer he was required to end his service and seek permission before seeking office. 
Anan’s spokesman denied he had broken any laws. The charges “come from an inaccurate reading of Anan’s announcement,” Hazem Hosni told Reuters, without elaborating. The campaign announced Anan was halting his bid. 
“To be banned by the state to enter the elections ... (means) that the state doesn’t want to hold an election,” Anan’s spokesman Hosni said. 
The military declined to comment on Anan’s detention. The interior ministry could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The Military Prosecution later issued a statement banning media coverage of its investigation into Anan. 
A witness who knows Anan told Reuters the candidate was detained while driving to his office shortly before the army statement was broadcast. His car was stopped by what appeared to be armed military police on a main road in Cairo. 
Anan, who served as armed forces chief of staff from 2005-2012, was the final high profile challenger to Sisi left in the race after a number of others dropped out, some citing intimidation by the authorities. 
“He was the longest-serving chief of staff but that didn’t stop them arresting him,” Anan’s office director Mustafa al-Shal said outside the Military Prosecutor’s office. 
Egypt’s president’s office and government press center have not commented on the election race. The electoral commission has said it will ensure the vote is fair and transparent. 
Sisi, who as military chief led the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 and was elected president the following year, announced last week he will seek a second term in the election set for late March. CANDIDATES WITHDRAW 
Ahmed Shafik, a former prime minister and air force chief, abandoned a bid this month, saying that after several years living abroad he was out of touch with Egyptian politics. The announcement came amid media criticism and speculation that he was being held by authorities in a Cairo hotel. 
Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, the nephew of assassinated President Anwar al-Sadat, said last week he would not run, citing an environment of fear surrounding the vote. 
Rights lawyer Khaled Ali has said he will still run, but he might be disqualified over a legal case against him. 
Anan announced his presidential bid in a video declaration posted on his official Facebook page last week, saying he was running to save Egypt from incorrect policies and calling on state institutions to maintain neutrality toward all candidates. 
Egyptian law requires former army officials to end their service and receive permission from the military before they can run for political office. The army’s statement said Anan had falsified documents that stated his military service had ended. 
Sisi’s critics say his popularity has eroded over tough economic reforms tied to a $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan, which have squeezed many Egyptians, and over a crackdown on dissidents. 
His supporters say firm measures are necessary to bring security and stability to a country that has seen unrest since a 2011 uprising toppled long-serving autocrat Hosni Mubarak.

Reporting Cairo bureau; Editing by Peter Graff and Janet Lawrence","On January 23, 2018, former military chief of staff Lieutenant General Sami Anan, the last significant challenger to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, was detained, leading him to suspend his presidential campaign. Anan, who served as armed forces chief of staff from 2005 to 2012, was accused by the army of violating military laws by running for office without permission. His arrest occurred shortly before an army statement was broadcast, claiming he had committed a ""serious breach"" of military service laws. Anan's campaign had previously called for neutrality from state institutions, and he aimed to address Egypt's pressing issues. His detention followed the withdrawal of other candidates, including former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik and Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, citing intimidation and fear. Sisi, who led the 2013 overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi, announced his intention to seek a second term in the upcoming election scheduled for late March 2018, amid criticism of his governance and economic reforms linked to a $12 billion IMF loan."

"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Depression and anxiety afflict Americans who are concerned with the fate of the environment, according to a study of the mental health effects of climate change.
Most hard-hit are women and people with low incomes who worry about the planet’s long-term health, said the study published this week in the journal Global Environmental Change.
Symptoms include restless nights, feelings of loneliness and lethargy.
“Climate change is a persistent global stressor,” said Sabrina Helm, lead author of the paper and professor of family and consumer sciences at the University of Arizona.
Risks to mental health from climate change are a “creeping development,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Due to climate change, scientists predict sea levels are on track to surge as temperatures rise, posing threats such as deadly heat, extreme weather and land swallowed by rising water.
World leaders mobilized to curb man-made greenhouse gas emissions to fight global warming in a 2015 agreement, although the United States has since said it would withdraw from the landmark deal.
Signs of depression do not appear in people concerned about climate change’s risks to humanity but do appear in people worried about its impact on other species, plants and nature overall, the research said.
The study pulled from 342 online surveys of respondents whose views broadly reflect the wider U.S. population, it said.
Experts have looked at ways extreme weather such as hurricanes and floods, whose intensity has increased due to climate change, can cause mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder, it said.
But little research has looked into anxiety arising from climate change as an everyday concern, the study said.

"Adam Jeffery | CNBC Robert Shiller 
Artificial intelligence (AI) could be the biggest challenge facing the jobs market and even humanity itself, according to Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller. 
However, the Yale University professor told CNBC that he had a radical idea that could be implemented to mitigate AI's potential harm to society. 
Speaking ahead of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, which he will be attending, Shiller said: ""What we're seeing is something unprecedented, which is the arrival of artificial intelligence, which has a big impact."" 
Asked if he was worried about AI, Shiller said it was an unknown entity. ""It creates tremendous uncertainty and impacts different people differently,"" he said. ""And some people could be left out."" 
""It might turn out well. It may be that we'll have more school teachers and smaller classes, and people will be taking care of the elderly and we'll be living longer and there'll be people to look after the elderly. We'll see,"" he added. ""But, for me, the big thing is the uncertainty we face because of AI, it could be extremely disruptive."" 
AI has attracted a lot of attention in recent years amid widespread concern that artificial intelligence, or robots, will replace human workers, causing a seismic shift in society and the economy. 
In 2013, Oxford University published a study that estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs could be replaced by robots and automated technology within 20 years. And that view has been echoed by other high-profile tech leaders. 'Livelihood insurance' 
Not everyone agrees that AI will be such a bad thing, however. Research firm Gartner, for instance, said in a recent report that AI could in fact create 2.3 million jobs by 2020, exceeding the 1.8 million that it could wipe out . 
Shiller, who won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2013 for his work on asset prices and inefficient markets, said he advocated some kind of ""livelihood insurance"" to mitigate against the potential loss of jobs or drop in incomes that AI could cause. 
""I think that people are facing career risks like never before and what I've advocated in the book 'Finance and the Good Society' is that I think we should think about some kind of insurance program for individuals and their careers, and to prevent inequality from just running its course,"" he said. show chapters 1:23 PM ET Thu, 27 July 2017 | 01:28 
""People tend to worry about what's happening now and maybe redistributing income on a government basis now, but I think we should be moving towards other kinds of insurance-type of redistribution."" 
Asked more about the concept of livelihood insurance, that could insure people against a decline in their occupation or income, Shiller said the idea was already taking root but that it needed more ""figuring out"" for a wider application. 
""We're starting to see a bit of livelihood insurance (in action). We now have web design academies that teach young people how to program computers to run internet sites and they don't charge anything unless you get a job at a certain level of income. Then they'll tax your first year of income, they'll take 10 percent of your first year's income. They're promising you a job, and if you don't get a job you pay nothing — that's actually happening.""

"SANTIAGO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Pope Francis expressed his “pain and shame” on Tuesday over a sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church in Chile, seeking forgiveness for a crisis that has scarred its credibility and left many faithful sceptical of reform.
“Here I feel bound to express my pain and shame at the irreparable damage caused to children by some ministers of the Church,” he said in the presidential palace, drawing sustained applause from his listeners.
Francis was making his first official address of the trip in the presence of President Michelle Bachelet, other Chilean top officials, cardinals, bishops and foreign diplomats.
“I am one with my brother bishops, for it is right to ask for forgiveness and make every effort to support the victims, even as we commit ourselves to ensuring that such things do not happen again,” he said.
Catholics have been upset with Francis’ 2015 appointment of Bishop Juan Barros to head the small diocese of Osorno in south-central Chile. Barros has been accused of protecting his former mentor, Father Fernando Karadima, whom a Vatican investigation found guilty in 2011 of abusing teenage boys over many years. Karadima has denied the allegations and Barros said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.
But the scandal has gripped Chile, and, along with growing secularization, has hurt the standing of the Church that had been praised for defending human rights during the 1973-1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.
A poll by Santiago-based think tank Latinobarometro this month showed that the number of Chileans calling themselves Catholics fell to 45 percent last year, from 74 percent in 1995.
A group opposed to the visit posted on Twitter: “No more abuse, no more cover-ups, no more hypocrisy.”
At least eight Catholic churches have been attacked in Chile over the past week, including one with a homemade bomb where unidentified vandals left a pamphlet reading: “Pope Francis, the next bomb will be in your robe.”
No one was injured in the attacks and no one has claimed responsibility.
ANTI-POPE GRAFFITI Hours after the pope arrived, two churches were attacked and burned to the ground almost simultaneously in a small village near Temuco that the pope had planned to visit on Wednesday.
A church in the capital was also attacked during the night, causing minor damage. Vandals burned Chilean and Vatican flags at the site and tossed pamphlets with threats against the pope.
Graffiti on one church in the capital read ”Burn pope and “pope accomplice.”
But the welcome most Chileans have given the pope has been warm, with thousands of mostly young people lining the streets of the capital and hundreds of thousands attending a Mass in a Santiago park.
Francis read the speech in the Moneda palace, which Pinochet’s forces bombed from the air and with ground artillery on Sept. 11, 1973 while democratically elected President Salvatore Allende was inside.
The pope referred to that dark period, saying the country had “faced moments of turmoil, at times painful.” He praised the consolidation of democracy but said more had to be done to help the unemployed and native people.
Bachelet told the pope: “How wonderful to be able to tell you that today Chile has changed ... we strengthened our democracy, with more tolerance, more freedom and more transparency.”
Chile, with a population of about 17.4 million, is the world’s top copper producer, the fifth-largest economy in Latin America and one of the region’s most stable.
After a private meeting with Bachelet, Francis said Mass for tens of thousands of people in the capital’s sprawling Parque O‘Higgins.
Angelina Soto, 67, of San Francisco de Mostazal, south of Santiago, said she and her family arrived before sunrise. “We are very committed Catholics, we’ve been singing all morning,” she said. “I think (the visit) will change Chile, it will make us more generous, and help to close the gap between rich and poor.” (Additional reporting by Felipe Iturrieta; Editing by Bernadette Baum)
 ","On January 16, 2023, Pope Francis addressed the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church in Chile, expressing his “pain and shame” for the harm caused to children by some Church ministers. This marked his first official speech during his visit, attended by President Michelle Bachelet and various dignitaries. The scandal has significantly impacted the Church's credibility, with a poll revealing that the percentage of Chileans identifying as Catholics dropped from 74% in 1995 to 45% in 2022. In the week leading up to the Pope's visit, at least eight Catholic churches were attacked, including two that were burned down. Despite this, thousands of Chileans, particularly youth, warmly welcomed the Pope, with hundreds of thousands attending a Mass in Parque O'Higgins. Chile, with a population of approximately 17.4 million, is the world's top copper producer and has been recognized for its stable economy and democratic progress."

"January 25, 2018 / 12:07 PM / Updated 3 hours ago Digital publishers ramp up TV push to nab viewers, ad dollars Jessica Toonkel 4 Min Read 
(Reuters) - Online media companies ATTN:, BuzzFeed and Group Nine Media are making a bigger push into television, executives said, aiming to grab more of the TV advertising market and depend less on social media for viewers. 
While the companies have long lured audiences through social media like Facebook Inc, that has made them vulnerable to changes that could bury their content. TV also offers the opportunity for revenue from licensing shows domestically and abroad. 
Three-year-old ATTN:, which draws more than half of viewers for its videos on current events from Facebook, is in development on two pilots. It has sold a pilot of a documentary-style news show to CBS Corp’s Showtime and is co-producing a series called “America Versus” with Paramount Television, the television studio owned by Viacom Inc, Matt Segal, ATTN:’s chief executive, told Reuters. 
As digital media becomes more competitive, television is a crucial next step for companies like BuzzFeed, which announced layoffs for 100 employees last year amid reports it missed revenue targets, executives said. 
Group Nine and BuzzFeed already have shows on air or scheduled with networks owned by their respective investors Discovery Communications and Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal, and are now pitching pilots to other networks, executives told Reuters. 
Facebook recently changed its news feed to favour posts from friends and family of its more than 2 billion users over content shared by publishers, underscoring the risk of depending too much on third-party social media. 
“Our weakness is we don’t own those platforms and that’s just the reality,” said Ben Lerer, CEO of New York-based Group Nine, which owns travel brand Thrillist, video news creator NowThis and animal video site The Dodo. “This is a way of gaining revenue outside of that ecosystem.” 
Television also offers a much more lucrative advertising market, executives said, even as viewers increasingly cancel cable subscriptions in favour of online streaming services like Netflix Inc. 
Spending on TV spots is expected to be $72 billion this year, compared to $15.4 billion for digital ad spending, according to market researcher eMarketer. 
Los Angeles-based ATTN: always planned to get into TV and expects to bring in seven figures of ad revenue this year if its pilots get picked up, said Segal. 
Segal declined to comment on how much ad revenue the company brings in now, but said it would also earn fees from licensing shows to partners in the United States and abroad. 
“Television is going to bring us more ad revenue and brand lift,” he said. I WANT MY TV 
Vice Media was the first digital media company to get into TV with its own show on HBO, as well as its own channel, Viceland. 
Vice News Tonight brought in on average 174,000 viewers between the ages of 18-49 in 2017, compared to 130,000 the previous year, according to Nielsen. 
ATTN:’s pilot with Showtime is a documentary-style series that addresses topics like politics, socioeconomics, and the war on drugs. 
“America Versus,” ATTN:’s show it is developing with Paramount Television, will take topics like binge drinking and look at them in the United States versus other countries, Segal said. 
Group Nine’s The Dodo will premier its first TV series, “Dodo Heroes,” featuring people who save animals in need, with Discovery’s Animal Planet this year. 
BuzzFeed is shopping a game show to a number of broadcast networks, which would be the first time it has a show outside of NBC networks, said Matthew Henick, head of BuzzFeed Motion Pictures. BuzzFeed recently announced a documentary series with NBC’s Oxygen network. 
“It used to be with digital you were just hoping to work within an algorithm where viewers are going to go,” Henick said. “Now people know what to expect if they go to a BuzzFeed News show.” 
(This version of the story corrects paragraph 3 to show that ATTN: is working with Paramount Television, not Paramount Network) Reporting By Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Anna Driver and Meredith Mazzilli","Digital publishers ATTN:, BuzzFeed, and Group Nine Media are increasingly venturing into television to capture a larger share of the $72 billion TV advertising market, compared to just $15.4 billion for digital ads, as reported by eMarketer. ATTN:, which relies on Facebook for over 50% of its viewership, is developing two pilots, including a documentary series for Showtime and a co-production with Paramount Television. Group Nine and BuzzFeed are also pitching new shows to various networks, with BuzzFeed recently announcing a game show and a documentary series with NBC's Oxygen. In 2017, Vice Media's ""Vice News Tonight"" averaged 174,000 viewers aged 18-49, up from 130,000 the previous year. The shift to TV is seen as a strategy to reduce dependence on social media platforms, which have altered their algorithms, impacting content visibility. ATTN: anticipates generating seven figures in ad revenue this year if its pilots are picked up, highlighting the potential for increased revenue through television."

"January 24, 2018 / 2:55 AM / Updated 12 minutes ago Trump to name tax lawyer Rettig to head IRS - Politico Reuters Staff 2 Min Read 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump plans to nominate tax lawyer Charles “Chuck” Rettig to serve as commissioner of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Politico reported on Tuesday, citing multiple sources with knowledge of the White House selection process. 
Asked about the report, a White House spokeswoman said the administration had no personnel announcements to make for now. 
If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Rettig will have to oversee implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump in December, that makes major changes to the tax code. 
He will also have to deal with an agency weakened by sharply reduced staffing after budget cuts by Republican lawmakers in recent years. The IRS has lost more than 17,000 employees, almost 20 percent of its staff, since 2010. 
Rettig, who has been at Hochman, Salkin, Rettig, Toscher & Perez in California for more than 35 years, specializes in federal and state civil tax and criminal tax controversy matters and tax litigation, according to his entry on the law firm’s website. 
He has represented clients before the IRS, the Justice Department’s Tax Division, numerous state tax authorities and in federal and state court litigation and appeals, the entry said. 
Rettig has also chaired the IRS Advisory Council, which counsels the commissioner on tax administration issues, according to the website.

"ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A crop munching worm that can fly up to 100 km (60 miles) at night is spreading rapidly across Africa, threatening food production and the livelihoods of millions of farmers already struggling with conflicts and drought, experts said on Friday.
The larvae form of fall armyworm prefers maize, but can feed on more than 80 plant species including rice, sorghum, millet, sugarcane, vegetable crops and cotton, said the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).
“There are roughly 35 million hectares of maize planted per year in Africa and if (the worm is) not in all those maize fields now, it will be very soon in the next planting season or so,” said Allan Hruska, principal technical coordinator at FAO.
The fields are tended by some 30 million smallholder farmers who depend on maize for food and income, Hruska said.
“Fall armyworm poses a great challenge to the survival of agriculture in Africa,” with potential to put hundreds of millions at risk of hunger, Mark Green, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a statement.
The invasive species, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, was first detected in Central and Western Africa in early 2016.
It has now spread to virtually all of sub-Saharan Africa, according to an FAO map seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The female moth can lay up to 1,000 eggs in her lifetime.
In December, Malawi declared 20 out of 28 districts disaster areas after an outbreak of fall armyworm. In Zimbabwe, fall armyworm destroyed 20 percent of the country’s maize crop last season, according to government figures, at a time when the country was recovering from devastating drought.
Losses in Africa could range from 8 to 20 million tonnes in just 12 maize-producing countries alone if the pest is not controlled, and could be more severe in areas already suffering drought and conflict, said Ken Wilson, professor of evolutionary ecology at Lancaster University in England.
Drought-affected plants are less able to resist the pests while conflict may prevent farmers from accessing much-needed help, he said.
Farmers in America use genetically modified plants and advanced pesticides to control the pests, but these options may be too expensive, and harm the environment and crops.
“(The farmers) can get pesticides from the government this year, but what happens next year, or the year after that?” said Wafaa El Khoury, technical specialist at the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in Rome.
Mixing crops and encouraging natural predators may be more effective, from the experience of smallholder farmers in the Americas, said FAO’s Hruska.
But Wilson said fall armyworm’s presence in Africa is irreversible. “It’s here to stay and we need to develop strategies on how best to manage this pest long-term,” he said.

LA JOLLA, California (Reuters) - Tiger Woods drove the ball wildly but hit some sensational recovery shots to slightly improve his position halfway through the third round at the Farmers Insurance Open on Saturday. 
Woods found the fairway with his tee shot only once, and some of his misses were by wide margins as he picked up three birdies and two bogeys on his outward half at Torrey Pines. 
He began his inward nine at two under par, 10 strokes behind leaders Ryan Palmer and Luke List.

"No. 22 Tennessee nearly blew a 20-point, second-half lead, but hung on to knock off visiting Vanderbilt, 67-62, at Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville on Tuesday night.
Guard Jordan Bowden had 19, while forward Grant Williams chipped in 18 for the Vols (14-5, 5-3 SEC). Williams was 12-of-14 from the foul line, with many coming in the second half as the Vols struggled to get field goals.
A pair of seniors, guard Riley LaChance (25) and Jeff Roberson (21), led Vandy (7-13, 2-6) in scoring. All of LaChance’s points came in the second half.
Vanderbilt had cut UT’s lead to 60-58, but Vol guard Lamonte Turner buried an open 3 from the left side with 1:03 left. After LaChance missed a 3, Bowden hit a lay-up with 33 seconds left to provide insurance.
The Vols led by 20 on three different occasions in the second half in the midst of a stretch where VU missed 17 3-pointers in a row. Tennessee was up 41-21 with 14:28 left after Turner hit a jumper from the right side.
But the Vols suddenly had trouble scoring from the field as LaChance hit four 3s in a row. Vandy pulled within four when guard Larry Austin Jr. assisted on a couple of transition lay-ups, the second a pass to Roberson with 7:06 left.
But Tennessee was able to close, and with that, sweep the regular-season series.
Vanderbilt’s Payton Willis hit a 3 on the game’s first possession, aiding the Commodores to a 7-4 lead to start. It took a terrible turn for the Commodores, who trailed 32-15 at half, from there.
Tennessee’s tight man-to-man defense made it difficult for the Commodores to find an offensive rhythm. Even when Vanderbilt got open shots, it couldn’t hit them.
The Vols’ Bowden had no such troubles, hitting 3 of 4 of his first-half 3-pointers, leading all scorers at half.
Tennessee also hit 8 of 12 first-half free throws, while Vanderbilt missed its only attempt.
Vanderbilt announced before the game that guard Matthew Fisher-Davis’s collegiate career is over. The senior, Vanderbilt’s second-leading scorer (11.9) was a preseason first-team All-SEC pick and hadn’t played since Vanderbilt’s loss to Kentucky on Jan. 13. That leaves VU with 10 eligible scholarship players.

"Finance Alibaba Founder Jack Ma Says He's Reconsidering a Stock Listing in Hong Kong Alibaba chair Jack Ma and Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam attend a Jumpstarter conference in Hong Kong on Nov. 21, 2017. Bobby Yip—Reuters By Reuters 9:34 PM EST 
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (baba) will consider a listing in Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post reported the company’s founder Jack Ma as saying—remarks which follow the city’s decision to allow dual class share listings. 
Ma was responding to an invitation by Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to list in the city during a discussion at an event in Hong Kong. 
“Alibaba will take this message. We will definitely consider Hong Kong’s market,” the newspaper quoted Ma as saying . “We hope we can further invest in Hong Kong and enhance our participation in the city’s economy,” he said. 
Alibaba held its record $25 billion public float in New York in 2014 after Hong Kong, its favored venue, refused to accept its governance structure where a self-selecting group of senior managers control the majority of board appointments . 
But Hong Kong is now set to allow dual-class shares under rule changes to be proposed by the city’s stock exchange as it raises the stakes in its battle against New York for blockbuster Chinese initial public offerings (IPOs).

"January 24, 2018 / 5:20 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Chung blazes trail into Australian Open semi-finals Ian Ransom 4 Min Read 
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Chung Hyeon’s trailblazing run through the Australian Open continued on Wednesday as the relentless South Korean tossed American Tennys Sandgren aside 6-4 7-6(5) 6-3 to become his nation’s first grand slam semi-finalist. 
Bespectacled like Clark Kent but playing like Superman at a sunbathed Rod Laver Arena, world number 58 Chung became the lowest ranked player into the last four at Melbourne Park since Marat Safin in 2004. 
The muscular 21-year-old will meet either champion Roger Federer or Tomas Berdych for a place in the final, and should head into that clash brimful of confidence. 
As in his fourth round elimination of six-times champion Novak Djokovic, Chung had all the answers against world number 97 Sandgren, returning virtually everything the battling American could throw at him. 
A near-perfect display finished with a wobble when serving out the match, as he squandered a 40-0 lead and saw a total of five match points evaporate into a cloudless sky. 
He later admitted to thinking prematurely about victory and what it might mean for his expectant nation. 
“I think (in the) last game, many things come together. If I win one more point, I make history in Korea,” he told reporters. 
“Something I (was) thinking like that. I have to think about the ceremony. Anyway, I had to stay calm because... the match was not finished yet.” 
Chung’s raw power ultimately prevailed, a blazing forehand into the corner causing a scrambling Sandgren to push his desperate retrieve well past the baseline. 
Chung flashed a broad grin as South Koreans draped in flags roared in the terraces and his mother shaped a love heart with her arms from the players’ box. 
South Korea has been late to the party in global tennis but Chung’s success could light a fire for the sport in the east Asian nation. 
It has also been a devastating raid by a player barely spoken about before the tournament, with most of the buzz around young guns like Germany’s Alexander Zverev, who Chung dismantled in the third round, and Australian Nick Kyrgios.

The match began in an unnerving way for all concerned, a false alarm ringing out and warning to “evacuate, evacuate, evacuate” early in the first set. 
Play was halted for a few moments and some fans scurried for the exits. 
Chung broke Sandgren in the third game and served out the set to love, then took the heavy-legged American’s serve again to take a 2-0 lead in the second. Slideshow (2 Images) 
Sandgren rallied strongly, breaking Chung twice but he faltered when serving for the set at 5-3. 
The Korean converted a second break point to get back on serve and the pair fought furiously in a breathless tiebreak. 
Sandgren wound his forehand up for a straightforward winner to secure two set points but instead thumped the ball into the net to allow Chung to level at 5-5. 
Another rush of blood saw the American fire long, and a clinical Chung needed only one chance to take the set. 
The Korean flapped his hands at the crowd in triumph, as a red-faced Sandgren retired to his chair to shake his head and fume. 
The American appeared spent and slumped to a 3-1 deficit, but gave the crowd their money’s worth with brilliant volleying to save a fifth match point. 
The 26-year-old bowed out to warm applause from the crowd, though a storm over his social media links with right wing nationalists raged on in the background. 
“I‘m happy with being resilient,” Sandgren said. 
“It’s not easy to come off some big wins, biggest wins of my career, crazy stages, like quarter-finals of a slam... and to deal with the stuff off the court as well.” Editing by Greg Stutchbury/John O'Brien","On January 24, 2018, Chung Hyeon made history by defeating American Tennys Sandgren 6-4, 7-6(5), 6-3 in the Australian Open quarter-finals, becoming South Korea's first grand slam semi-finalist.

"This time of year, college students are returning to school, buying books and selecting classes. It's also when they should start to think seriously about how to get hired by May. By starting the job search process now, students can make sure they land a role that can help jumpstart their careers and make their degrees pay off . Here are five things that students should do now to make sure they have an exciting opportunity to embark on in May:
1. Refresh your resume When you start a new job search, your first step should always be to freshen up your resume. Monster career expert Vicki Salemi says that students should include the most recent relevant information including coursework and research projects. ""They should make sure their resume is up to date,"" says Salemi. ""And that doesn't only mean to include their internships, it also means they should be incorporating relevant classwork and other projects or experiences that are happening this semester. ""
Salemi explains that experiences, like shadowing a professor or working a campus job, can be great talking points for demonstrating your strengths — especially if you don't have years and years of professional experience to talk about. Mark Bennington Vicki Salemi 2.","As college students return to school, they should begin their job search to secure roles by May. Key steps include refreshing resumes with recent coursework and experiences. Experts recommend highlighting relevant projects and campus jobs to showcase strengths, especially for those lacking extensive professional experience."
"Network ""Right now is the ideal time to network,"" says Salemi. ""Start reaching out to classmates who graduated last year or the year before that. ""
Once you have reached out to your closest connections , be sure to take advantage of your school's career services. Career centers often have extensive data about alumni, offer mock interviews and can help you polish off your resume. ""Ask them to run a list for you of alumni who work in the company and/or industry you want to pursue,"" says Salemi. ""While you're at the career center, make an appointment to schedule a mock interview, because while you're actively networking, you should also make sure your interview skills are sharp. ""
3. Job alerts One of the most underrated job search hacks is to set up alerts that inform you about opportunities that interest you . Monster, LinkedIn and Google all offer services that will send you emails or notifications indicating that a role you are interested has opened up. Once you receive news about a job you are interested in, get your application in as soon as possible.","Salemi advises networking with alumni from the past two years and utilizing career services for mock interviews and resume help. Set up job alerts on platforms like Monster, LinkedIn, and Google to receive notifications about new opportunities, ensuring timely applications."
"""When opportunities land in your inbox, apply immediately, don't wait. If you see a job, you should apply that day,"" says Salemi. ""You should never assume it will be posted for a long time. ""
4. Chase your dream company If you have scanned the career page of your ideal company and do not see any open positions, do not be deterred says Salemi. ""If your dream employer doesn't have any openings, you should still reach out to them because you never know when they will have an opening and you want to be top of mind,"" she explains. By contacting the company early on in the semester, you make sure that your name is the first one they think of when an opportunity opens up. show chapters This is how much education you need to land a job at the world's biggest tech companies      1:26 PM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 | 00:56 5. Sharpen your soft skills One of the most fun things you can do now to prepare yourself for a job in May is to strengthen your soft skills. Students can ""polish their soft skills by going out of their comfort zone — go to a wrestling match or theater event — it's all about small talk, introducing yourself with an elevator pitch,"" says Salemi.","Apply for job opportunities immediately upon receiving them, as they may not be posted long. If your dream company has no openings, reach out anyway to stay top of mind. Additionally, enhance your soft skills by engaging in activities like wrestling matches or theater events to practice small talk and elevator pitches."
"This is a fun way that young people can make sure they can have in-person conversations with people outside of their typical social circles. Salemi argues, ""Since the graduating class is digital native, it's even more important to be able to interact in real-time and be able to hold a good conversation. ""
Meeting new people and trying new things is also a great way to spend your last few months as a student. Like this story? Like CNBC Make It on Facebook

"Debt, geopolitics, unexpected world events and a widespread sense of general happiness: these are the things that worry private equity billionaire David Rubenstein the most.
The co-founder of global private equity firm Carlyle Group detailed his concerns while speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, during a panel on Tuesday entitled ""The Next Financial Crisis.""
""Right now, the biggest concern I have is that most people think there is no problem of a likely recession this year or even maybe early next year. Generally when people are very happy and confident, something wrong happens,"" Rubenstein cautioned at the Bloomberg-moderated panel.
""I am nervous that the conventional wisdom is that we have no recession problems around the world, that everybody's doing quite well ... The conventional wisdom is usually wrong, and it might be in this case.""
The American businessman and philanthropist went on to explain why debt and geopolitics are further sources of concern.
show chapters David Rubenstein: I think we'd be lucky and happy to get close to 3 percent GDP 10:17 AM ET Tue, 23 Jan 2018 | 01:00 ""I do worry that governments have a little bit too much debt, and maybe they have too many entitlement programs they're ultimately not going to be able to honor. At some point, people are going to wake up and say the U.S. government has $20 trillion dollars of debt and unfunded liabilities that are hard to fathom.""
Trepidation over mounting global debt is not new; numerous CEOs and finance officials have cited greater leverage across both emerging and advanced economies as among the greatest threats to global economic stability.
Rubenstein continued, ""I worry about geopolitical things we can't anticipate, the so-called black swans,"" suggesting a slew of potential threats from a ""9/11 type event"" to pandemics and conflicts involving Iran, Russia and China.
Meanwhile, the CEO of Bank Pekao, Poland's second-largest bank, made a similar warning about what he believed to be a sort of oblivious optimism.
""Obviously there are many reasons to be optimistic -- the U.S. economy is growing fast, positive IMF outlook, emerging markets are growing fast,"" Pekao's Michal Krupinski told CNBC Wednesday.
""The problem is that once you're not able to find an imbalance in the global economy, you should always be aware of what is the weakest link. This makes me worried.""
""Secondly, we have unprecedented actions from central banks,"" he added, referring to central banks' prolonged quantitative easing policies. ""The drug will be cut one day, and we're facing lots of structural problems.""
A common theme at Davos, and indeed over the past several months among investors, is whether the current skyrocketing growth of market valuations and increased capital flows are a harbinger of the next crash . David Rubenstein seems to think so.
""I think when everybody is complacent, that's usually when you have to be nervous,"" he said.

Jan 11 (Reuters) - British staffing company Hays Plc reported higher second-quarter net fees on Thursday, helped by strong performance in its international businesses.
The company said it continues to see vigorous trading conditions in the majority of its international markets, reporting a 16 percent rise in net fee growth in its Asia Pacific business.
The company, which places workers in areas such as finance and IT, reported a 13 percent rise in second-quarter group net fees at constant currencies in the three months ended Dec. 31.
Net fees from its UK and Ireland operations rose 1 percent and the company said business in the UK remained stable.
Most British staffing companies are relying on their overseas business to drive growth as uncertainty following Britain’s June 2016 vote to leave the European Union curbs domestic demand.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The dollar hit fresh lows on Wednesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he welcomed a weakening of the U.S. currency, which some investors interpreted as a departure from traditional U.S. policy.
“Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it related to trade and opportunities,” Mnuchin told the World Economic Forum in Davos a day before a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump in the Swiss ski resort.
Mnuchin added: “Longer term, the strength of the dollar is a reflection of the strength of the U.S. economy and the fact that it is and it continues to be the primary currency in terms of the reserve currency.”
IS IT A BREAK FROM POLICY? While some analysts argue that Mnuchin’s comments do not break with the U.S. “strong dollar” policy, his remarks caused concern among investors because they come days after the Trump administration slapped steep tariffs on foreign-made washing machines and solar panels.
The remarks came as the Trump administration has warned that it is preparing a package of trade actions against China, which could spark a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
HISTORY OF ‘STRONG DOLLAR’ POLICY
U.S. Treasury secretaries have been repeating that the strong dollar is in U.S. national interests since the late 1990s, when Robert Rubin held the job in the Clinton administration.
That phrasing lost its weight and credibility when it was overused by the Bush administration, although the Obama administration tried to persuade the world that the policy was for real as it sought to borrow $2 trillion to revive the U.S. economy after its worst crisis in decades.
WHY DID THE UNITED STATES ADOPT THE POLICY? The strong dollar policy was seen as a way to assure investors that Washington would not intervene in exchange markets to debase the currency.
The policy, however, has lost some of its relevance given the role of the Federal Reserve in financial markets. The U.S. central bank’s purchases and sales of securities are major drivers in the value of the dollar and Fed policymakers say they follow foreign exchange rates closely, even though U.S. central bankers defer to the U.S. Treasury for comments about dollar policy.

Tennis - ATP World Tour Finals Preview - The O2 Arena, London, Britain - November 11, 2017 Great Britain's Andy Murray stands during a minutes silence as part of remembrance commemorations during practice Action Images via Reuters/Tony O'Brien 
Murray has not played a competitive match since a Wimbledon quarter-final loss last July due to the complaint and despite coming through a one-set exhibition in Abu Dhabi last week, he was unable to train on Tuesday and announced his withdrawal. 
“I‘m very disappointed to be withdrawing from the Brisbane International,” Murray, seeded second in Brisbane, told tournament organisers before going into further detail of his predicament in an emotional post on social media. 
“Having been recommended to treat my hip conservatively since the U.S. Open, I have done everything asked of me from a rehab perspective and worked extremely hard to try get back on the court competing,” Murray said on his Instagram account. 
”Having played practice sets here in Brisbane with some top players unfortunately this hasn’t worked yet to get me to the level I would like so I have to reassess my options. Continuing rehab is one option and giving my hip more time to recover. 
“Surgery is also an option but the chances of a successful outcome are not as high as I would like which has made this my secondary option and my hope has been to avoid that. However, this is something I may have to consider but let’s hope not.” 
The world number 16 had been due to play his first tournament match of the season on Thursday with a second-round encounter against American Ryan Harrison at Pat Rafter Arena. He will be replaced by German lucky loser Yannick Hanfmann. 
Murray, who said on Sunday that he planned to trim his schedule in 2018 to prevent a recurrence of his injury issues, will remain in Brisbane for the rest of the week before planning his next move. 
“In the short term I‘m going to be staying in Australia for the next couple of days to see if my hip settles down a bit and will decide by the weekend whether to stay out here or fly home to assess what I do next,” the 30-year-old added. 
“Sorry for the long post but I wanted to keep everyone in the loop and get this off my chest as it’s really hurting inside.” 
Brisbane tournament director Cameron Pearson wished the three-times grand slam winner well. 
“I‘m really disappointed for Andy, as I know how much he was looking forward to getting his season started in Brisbane,” he said. 
“As a two-time former champion, he has great memories of playing on Pat Rafter Arena and thrilling his fans. I wish him all the best to be ready to play the Australian Open.” 
Murray’s latest injury setback will also come as a blow to Australian Open organisers ahead of the year’s first major in Melbourne starting on Jan. 15, along with those of fellow “Big Four” members Rafael Nadal (back) and Novak Djokovic (elbow). Writing by John O'Brien in Singapore; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly","On January 2, 2018, former world number one Andy Murray withdrew from the Brisbane International due to ongoing hip issues, expressing uncertainty about his recovery for the Australian Open starting January 15. Murray, seeded second in Brisbane, has not played competitively since his Wimbledon quarter-final loss in July 2017. Despite participating in a one-set exhibition in Abu Dhabi, he was unable to train and announced his withdrawal, stating he may need to reassess his options, including further rehab or potential surgery. The 30-year-old, currently ranked 16th, was set to face American Ryan Harrison in the second round, but will be replaced by German lucky loser Yannick Hanfmann. This injury setback also impacts Australian Open organizers, alongside injuries to Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic."
"BEIJING (Reuters) - France welcomes long-term investments from China, but only after screening deals to ensure French assets are not “looted”, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday in Beijing.
In China on a three-day state visit, French President Emmanuel Macron is pushing for a more balanced trade relationship, hoping in particular to reduce France’s 30 billion euro ($35.8 billion) trade shortfall with the country.
Le Maire said more balance would mean better access to Chinese markets while protecting French technologies and setting limits on Chinese investments in France.
Asked if his ministry would from now on screen Chinese investments, Le Maire said: “Yes, and I reject many.”
He added that he would announce plans on Jan. 15 to boost a 2014 decree requiring foreign companies to get permission from the French state before taking control of French firms in the energy, telecoms, transport, water and the health sectors
“We accept long-term investments but not looting,” he added.

"January 30, 2018 / 6:07 AM / in 3 minutes Russia's elite dismiss U.S. list as 'telephone book' of the wealthy Polina Devitt , Katya Golubkova 6 Min Read 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s elite on Tuesday shrugged off U.S. publication of a sweeping list of oligarchs close to the Kremlin as simply a “telephone directory” of the rich, though a Kremlin spokesman said it could even harm the image of Russia’s political leaders. One Western businessman said it could create uncertainty in dealings with sectors of Russian business. One Russian energy executive feared for future dealings with foreign banks. The U.S. Treasury Department named top businessmen including the heads of the two of Russia’s biggest banks, metals magnates and the boss of the state gas monopoly on a list of oligarchs close to Russian power. The list of 210 people, including 96 ‘oligarchs’ with wealth of $1 billion or more, was drawn up as part of a sanctions package signed into law in August last year. The document said inclusion did not mean those named were likely to be sanctioned, although it seemed it would cast the shadow of potential sanctions over a wide circle of wealthy Russians. “Publication of such a wide list of everything and everyone could potentially damage the image and reputation of our firms, our businessmen, our politicians, and of members of the leadership,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, himself included on the list, told reporters. Shares in some of the big metals companies - Norilsk Nickel and aluminum giant Rusal, whose owners were named - initially fell, though Russian stock in general recovered later. President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle is already subject to personal U.S. sanctions imposed over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region.","On January 30, 2018, Russia's elite dismissed a U.S. Treasury Department list of 210 oligarchs, including 96 billionaires, as a mere ""telephone directory."" The list, part of sanctions from August 2017, included top businessmen from major banks and the state gas monopoly. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned it could harm the image of Russian leaders. Following the list's release, shares in companies like Norilsk Nickel and Rusal initially fell but later recovered."
"The White House said on Monday it would not immediately impose new sanctions on Russia. “All this looks more like a book, ‘Who’s Who in Russian Politics’. I as a member of the government am obliged to be on this list,” Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, one of 114 government officials named, told Reuters. THE LIST 
The 2017 sanctions package leading to the list being drawn up was prompted partly by Washington’s belief that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Kremlin denies these allegations. The list reached deep into the business elite and government. Officials and others named said it amounted to little more than a copy of last year’s Forbes list of Russia’s wealthiest people - with some factual mistakes thrown in. “It seems no-one decided to look too deeply. They just copied Forbes list,” said one oligarch whose name is on the list but who had distanced himself from Russian investments and Putin’s inner circle. FILE PHOTO - German Gref, chief executive of Russia's Sberbank, speaks during a session of the Gaidar Forum 2018 ""Russia and the World: values and virtues"" in Moscow, Russia, January 17, 2018.","The White House announced no immediate sanctions on Russia, despite a list of 114 officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, being released. This list, linked to 2017 sanctions over alleged election meddling, resembles last year's Forbes list of Russia's wealthiest, according to unnamed oligarchs."
"REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin 
Last year’s list in Forbes magazine estimated the total wealth of the oligarchs listed at almost $400 billion. A senior executive on a major energy company described it as a “telephone directory”, adding sarcastically: “This was really Titanic work.” The list also mentions Oleg Budargin as the chief executive of the state utility company Rosseti - though he was replaced in that post last September. “UNCERTAINTY” CREATED 
A Western banker who is currently involved in a deal with a person named on the list said it was unclear what inclusion meant. “If all these people were banned, 80 percent of deals (with Russian firms) would stall,” he said. Slideshow (2 Images) 
Another banker who works for a U.S. bank in Moscow described the list as ‘harmful. ’“It creates uncertainty around all more or less known people. Even without sanctions,” he said. Another state energy executive said he believed inclusion could complicate dealings with the foreign banks and raising financing for the companies whose owners were named. The list was sweeping though some names of people known to be closely associated with Putin were absent.","Forbes' last year’s list estimated the wealth of oligarchs at nearly $400 billion.

"U.K. grocer Sainsbury 's says it has experienced a record week of trading during the Christmas period with ""excellent"" operations across the whole group.
""We think it's a good performance in what of course continues to be a challenging market,"" Mike Coupe, chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, told CNBC Wednesday.
The second largest U.K. grocer reported an increase in like-for-like sales of 1.1 percent during its third quarter, which includes the Christmas period. Analysts had forecast a 0.9 percent increase, according to Reuters.
A key contributor to these results was Argos, the electricals retailer it acquired in 2016 and now has located within its stores. The number of collections using its fast track service, which allows customers to get their items within four hours of purchasing them, rose by 39 percent and deliveries rose by 25 percent in the three-month period.
Sainsbury's said in a statement that such services ""were particularly popular"" during Black Friday and the last few days leading up to Christmas.
show chapters Sainsbury’s Argos acquisition makes Amazon much bigger competitor: Pro 12 Hours Ago | 02:08 ""We are actually over-delivering against the synergies that we promised the markets when we actually acquired the Argos business,"" Coupe told CNBC.
""The Argos business really sets us up for our future, because one of the big stories of this Christmas is how much more growth has been online and as we see here today something like 20 percent of Sainsbury's sales are now online, a big part of that is Argos,"" he added.
However, the retailer warned that market conditions remain challenging due to an increase in inflation.
""We've seen a rise in inflation in the U.K. over the last year or so on the back of the Brexit vote and on the back of the devaluation of the pound and that means that customers' disposable income has, at its best, flattened and probably slightly declining and that has an effect on deferral purchases,"" Coupe explained.
Scott Barbour, Getty Images News, Getty Images The grocer has so far covered this impact of inflation itself, according to the CEO, and said it will do what it can to reduce the impact of higher prices on its customers.
""We are, broadly speaking, covering the cost of inflation in our business with our own efficiency initiatives,"" he said.
Coupe also told CNBC that he expects shareholder dividends to continue to rise slightly year-after-year.

The Argos acquisition significantly contributed, with a 39% rise in fast track collections and a 25% increase in deliveries. Online sales now account for 20% of total sales. Despite these gains, CEO Mike Coupe noted challenging market conditions due to rising inflation, which has affected disposable income.

This year’s seasonal flu epidemic is especially severe, according to the Centers for Disease Control, which says the deadly virus is now in every U.S. state. Jillian Kitchener reports. Press CTRL+C (Windows), CMD+C (Mac), or long-press the URL below on your mobile device to copy the code https://reut.rs/2DzuGou","The current seasonal flu epidemic in the U.S. is particularly severe, with the Centers for Disease Control reporting that the deadly flu strain has spread to all 50 states. The outbreak has raised significant health concerns nationwide, highlighting the widespread impact of this year's flu virus."
"CNBC's Jim Cramer firmly believes that this kind of bull market — the kind where the averages rally to all-time highs amid a government shutdown — requires the utmost insight and analysis. ""What's been working now is very different from what was working even a year ago,"" the "" Mad Money "" host said on Monday. ""This is the kind of story where a picture is indeed worth a thousand words. So tonight, we're going chart by chart, examining the winning groups in this new era to show you the true magnitude of this amazing transformation. ""
1. Banks Cramer started with the newly revitalized bank stocks, many of which investors avoided for months in favor of financial technology stocks or payment processors. ""Why? Primarily because long-term and short-term interest rates were so low that ... [the banks] couldn't get the margins they needed on their loans or on your deposits,"" Cramer said. As a result, investors flocked to steady growth stocks like Visa and Mastercard , shying away from traditional bank equities altogether. Other than Visa, Mastercard, Discover , PayPal and ancillary plays like Moody's and Morningstar , ""it was simply too risky to go deep into the actual deposit institutions,"" Cramer said.","Jim Cramer highlights a transformative bull market, noting that bank stocks, previously avoided, are now revitalized as interest rates rise. He contrasts this with a year ago when investors favored growth stocks like Visa and Mastercard. Cramer emphasizes the need for detailed analysis in this evolving market landscape."
"""As long as the banks' net interest margins — that's the difference between what they pay you for deposits and what they charge you for your loans — stayed low, there was no reason to embrace either the big banks or the regionals, for that matter,"" he continued. But since the Federal Reserve came to a consensus on the economy's well-being and began to raise interest rates, the bank stocks kicked back into high gear on Wall Street. Coupled with loan growth and deregulation from Washington, rising rates paint a rosier picture for the big banks' prospects. Many of the banks have also upped their share buyback programs, which tend to boost stock prices. ""The banks are just getting back to where they were before the Bush and Obama administrations forced [them to issue] that ton of equity during the great recession,"" Cramer said. ""In fact, the banks are now overcapitalized and they've got a much larger share of the lending pie than would've been permissible 10 years ago, especially the big dogs: J.P. Morgan , Wells Fargo , Bank of America , Citigroup . All but Wells now behave like growth stocks, and Wells is joining that. ""
2. Tech The leadership of the FANG stocks, Cramer's acronym for Facebook , Amazon , Netflix and Google, now Alphabet , has defined the tech sector for years. Recently, however, Cramer has watched the internet of things become the rising tide that lifts all (or most) boats for the tech sector, injecting a new secular growth story into many formerly cyclical names.","banks' net interest margins remain low, but rising interest rates from the Federal Reserve have boosted bank stocks significantly. Many banks, including J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup, are now overcapitalized and hold a larger share of the lending market than a decade ago. Meanwhile, the tech sector, led by FANG stocks, is experiencing new growth driven by the internet of things."
"""With the rise of the internet of things, not to mention the ascendancy of the data center thanks to a new cloud-based software model, as well as the connected car [and] the connected home, the whole tech sector has been roaring,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Cramer focused on three winning cohorts: the internet of things stocks like Texas Instruments , Analog Devices and Cramer-fave Nvidia ; the cloud plays like Adobe , Amazon, VMware and Microsoft ; and the communications names, Qualcomm , Xilinx and Broadcom . Companies that help companies move to the cloud are also working, Cramer said, pointing to Workday , ServiceNow , Salesforce.com and Accenture as his top picks. He added that in the cybersecurity space, Fortinet and Proofpoint are standing out as good buys. 3. Health care Cramer has been utterly surprised by the strength in the health care stocks, from drug distributors to insurers to hospital operators. ""This is all about a peculiar backlash from Washington,"" he said. ""After the Republicans took over the White House and Congress, we figured they would be hellbent on making this sector smaller [and] less lucrative, because a lot of it relies on the government. But when the GOP failed to obliterate Obamacare last year, investors rushed back into a sector that many people had shorted.","Jim Cramer highlighted the tech sector's growth, driven by the internet of things, cloud computing, and connected devices. Key stocks include Texas Instruments, Nvidia, Adobe, Amazon, and Qualcomm. He noted strong performance in healthcare stocks, countering expectations after the GOP's failure to repeal Obamacare, leading to renewed investor interest in the sector."
"""
A booming economy usually brings poor tidings for the health care stocks, but this time, it has incited a resurgence in drug distributors like McKesson , AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal ; drugmakers AbbVie and Abbott ; and pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson , Cramer said. Other unexpected leaders include medical device and life science plays like Danaher , Thermo Fischer and Illumina . Cramer called the biotech group largely ""underrepresented"" except for Amgen , and labeled one of his favorite health stocks, UnitedHealth , a ""must-buy"" winner. 4. Retail It's been years since Wall Street saw the retailers as anything but dead meat. ""The only merchant that mattered was Amazon, the so-called Death Star destroying everything in its path as part of its never-ending quest for market share,"" Cramer said. ""We all figured this had become a zero-sum situation. "" But after an uptick in consumer spending that kicked off during 2017's robust holiday season, retailers are gaining momentum, implementing better plans to push back against Amazon's influence and developing their own e-commerce strategies. All of this has come together to drive stocks like Target , Kohl's and Walmart higher, as well as shares of direct e-commerce beneficiaries like shippers FedEx and UPS .","healthcare stocks like McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, and Johnson & Johnson are thriving, alongside medical device firms like Danaher and Illumina. Retailers such as Target, Kohl's, and Walmart are rebounding, aided by improved consumer spending since 2017, countering Amazon's dominance."
"At the same time, home improvement names Lowe's , Home Depot , Stanley Black & Decker and Best Buy are gaining momentum as people invest in their homes. ""I think it's too early to crown individual leaders within retail outside of home goods, but I've got to tell you, Walmart, Burlington Stores , Dollar Tree , Dollar General , they stand out because they can beat Amazon on price,"" Cramer said. ""Throw in Costco and you may have all you need. ""
With renewed control over their inventories and no need to spend heavily on advertising, Cramer said that even apparel plays like PVH , VF Corp and Michael Kors seemed ""nigh unstoppable. ""
5. Experiential Consumer spending is also lifting shares of travel and leisure companies like the airline, hotel and casino operators, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The cruise lines are roaring as there's really a dearth of ships and a plethora of younger people who've discovered that cruises make great backgrounds"" for photos on social media, he said. ""Don't rule out a Thor Industries because RVs are red-hot, again for the experience, for the selfie. Needless to say, you need Estee Lauder to make it all work. That stock won't quit.","home improvement retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot are thriving, while Walmart, Dollar Tree, and Costco excel in pricing against Amazon. Apparel brands like PVH and Michael Kors are strong, and travel sectors, including cruise lines and RVs, are booming due to experiential spending."
"It's obviously the cameras. ""
6. Industrials A slew of positive business cycles have ignited a resurgence in industrial stocks, from the oil drillers and refiners to the manufacturing and machinery plays. OPEC's production cuts and geopolitical turmoil in Venezuela have made the United States a central oil and gas producer, spurring expansion in areas like Texas' Permian Basin. ""We went from being in a deficit with natural gas to being the cheapest and world's largest producer,"" Cramer said. ""That has triggered a building boom for the chemical industry, as they use this stuff as their main feedstock. ""
This trend, combined with rising oil prices , has also paved the way for construction of new pipelines, factories and shipping terminals. To Cramer, that translates into ""the need for more horsepower in every form you can get it,"" which pushes stocks like Cummins , Caterpillar , Eaton and Parker-Hannifin higher. One area that doesn't need extra horsepower is aerospace, in which America is the ""practically unchallenged"" leader, Cramer said, dubbing Boeing , Honeywell and United Technologies his top picks. Finally, Cramer noted that defense contractors Raytheon , Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics , Lockheed Martin , as well as smaller players Leidos , L3 and Harris , are benefiting from the Republican control of Washington.","industrial stocks are thriving due to positive business cycles, with the U.S. becoming the world's largest natural gas producer. Rising oil prices have led to increased construction of pipelines and factories, boosting companies like Cummins and Caterpillar. Defense contractors like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin also benefit from Republican control."
"Final thoughts All things (and stocks) considered, Cramer determined that traditionally ""safe"" investments like the PepsiCos and Colgates of the world will not give investors the gains they want in this environment. ""Bottom line? You've just been given the only guide you need to pick among the winners for the best choices,"" Cramer said. ""Don't let the astounding nature of this rally blind you: it's very much for real and it's based on the fundamentals, ... which have only gotten even stronger now that tax reform is finally kicking in. ""

"January 3, 2018 / 11:45 AM / Updated 27 minutes ago Sri Lankan rupee ends steady in dull trade Reuters Staff 2 Min Read 
COLOMBO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee closed steady on Wednesday in dull trade, as demand for dollars from importers and banks offset conversion of the U.S. currency by exporters, dealers said. 
The spot rupee, which traded at 153.80 per dollar during the day, ended at 153.70/80 per dollar, unchanged from Tuesday’s close. 
The currency fell 2.5 percent last year and dropped 3.9 percent in 2016. 
“It was a dull day. There were not many importers in the market and the exporters are also reluctant to come as they are awaiting the central bank’s directive on derivatives,” said a currency dealer. 
The central bank, while announcing its key economic policies for this year, said the conduct of monetary policy is dependent on an effective and prudent exchange rate policy. 
“It has allowed more flexibility in determining the exchange rate based on the market conditions and has intervened only to smoothen volatility and to build up reserves,” the central bank said in its policy statement. 
“It is noteworthy that there has been a build-up of non-debt creating international reserves during 2017, with minimal impact on the exchange rate.” 
It also said that foreign exchange intervention policies will be adopted consistent with a flexible exchange rate regime and supportive of improving foreign exchange market functionality, and maintaining a competitive exchange rate will be an important objective. 
Dealers said the import pressure will be seen until the central bank sorts out the new derivatives regulations, which has slowed forward trading in the currency. (Reporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath)","On January 3, 2018, the Sri Lankan rupee closed steady at 153.70/80 per dollar, unchanged from the previous day, despite trading at 153.80 during the day. The currency fell 2.5% in 2017 and 3.9% in 2016. Dull trading was noted due to limited importer activity and exporters awaiting central bank directives on derivatives.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Industrial production and exports from Germany rose more than expected in November, prompting the government to raise its estimate of growth for 2017 and signalling that its expansion would carry on this year.
Industrial output jumped 3.4 percent for the month, the biggest increase since September 2009, the Federal Statistics Office reported on Tuesday, overshooting a 1.8 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.
Seasonally adjusted exports for November rose 4.1 percent on the month and domestic demand pushed imports up 2.3 percent. Both figures beat Reuters forecasts, and they widened the trade surplus to 22.3 billion euros ($26.61 billion) from 19.9 billion euros in October.
The figures and buoyant business sentiments suggest “that the German economy ended 2017 with a bang after the third quarter’s impressive 0.8 percent expansion,” Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics wrote in a note.
Soon after the data, the government raised its 2017 growth forecast to 2.2 percent from a previous estimate of 2.0 percent.
“The economy is stable,” Deputy Economy Minister Matthias Machnig said. “And we assume that it will continue at about the same level.”

A breakdown of the output data showed the main drivers were capital and consumer goods spending as well as construction.
The Statistics Office will publish on Thursday full-year gross domestic product figures for 2017, which are forecast to show 2.4 percent growth. Some analysts expect it to do better.
“German GDP looks set to have risen by slightly more than our above-consensus forecast of 2.5 percent in 2017 and we expect a similarly strong pace of growth this year,” McKeown said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian teenager attacked a group of younger students with an ax, injuring six people, before setting his school on fire, investigators said on Friday. 
Russia’s Investigative Committee said the attacker, a ninth-grader, attacked a group of seventh-grade students with an ax at a school just outside the Siberian city of Ulan-Ude, then set the room ablaze. 
Five students and one teacher were injured in the attack, the committee said. The attacker was detained and was now hospitalized after a suicide attempt, the committee said. 
Earlier this week, investigators opened a criminal case into a knife attack that injured 15 people at a school in the city of Perm. The case was initially reported as an assault by two masked men, but authorities later said it grew out of a knife fight between two students.

"U.S. government debt prices rose Thursday as the U.S. dollar pared earlier losses after President Donald Trump said he wants to see a stronger dollar.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell two basis points to 2.624 percent at 2:28 p.m. ET, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipped to 2.887 percent. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
Earlier, the yield on the 10-year note hit 2.676 percent, its highest level since Jul. 2014, when the 10-year yielded as high as 2.692 percent. The yield on the 2-year note hit 2.104 percent, its highest level since Sept. 2008.
The dollar rebounded against the euro Thursday afternoon after President Trump told CNBC that he would like see a stronger dollar. The president's comment come a day after the dollar fell the most in 10 months to three-year lows Wednesday.
""The dollar is going to get stronger and stronger, and ultimately I want to see a strong dollar,"" Trump said in an exclusive interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""Our country is becoming so economically strong again and strong in other ways, too.""
Symbol Yield Change %Change US 3-MO --- US 1-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- US 10-YR --- US 30-YR --- The dollar had been falling after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said a weak dollar is good for the United States.
""Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities,"" Mnuchin told reporters, according to Bloomberg, adding that the currency's short-term value is ""not a concern of ours at all.""
His comments reinforced statements from President Donald Trump , who previously stated that the dollar was ""too strong"" and that U.S. exporters can't compete because of the exchange rate.
But when the dollar depreciates, the price of foreign goods increase relative to domestically priced goods, making imports more expensive, leading to an increase in inflation in the U.S. Increasing inflation, in turn, undermines the real value of each coupon payment from holding debt, forcing the price of bonds down while simultaneously raising yields to attract buyers.
The euro also got a boost Thursday after European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi failed to convince investors that the central bank's easy monetary policies will last much longer.
The European currency has been trending northward over the past few weeks as the region's economy strengthens and national politics stabilize. A stronger euro could eventually hamstring European exports and weaken inflation.
The Treasury Department auctioned $28 billion in 7-year notes at a high yield of 2.565 percent. The bid-to-cover ratio, an indicator of demand, was 2.73. Indirect bidders, which include major central banks, were awarded 78.1 percent.
Direct bidders, which includes domestic money managers, bought 10.2 percent.

"European Union (EU) antitrust regulators slapped a 997 million euro ($1.23 billion) fine on U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm on Wednesday for paying Apple so that the iPhone maker only used its chips.

The European Commission, which launched an investigation into the matter in 2015, said the exclusivity payments began in 2011.

""Qualcomm illegally shut out rivals from the market for LTE baseband chipsets for over five years, thereby cementing its market dominance. Qualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rival,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

""This meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were. Qualcomm's behavior denied consumers and other companies more choice and innovation - and this in a sector with a huge demand and potential for innovative technologies,"" she continued.
Qualcomm confirmed to CNBC that it had received the decision, which applies to an expired agreement with Apple that ran through 2016. The chip company said the decision has no impact on ongoing operations.
""We are confident this agreement did not violate EU competition rules or adversely affect market competition or European consumers,"" Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. ""We have a strong case for judicial review and we will immediately commence that process.""

(Adds details on coverage and payouts, background) 
Jan 3 (Reuters) - Insurance Australia Group Ltd said on Wednesday it has finalised its catastrophe reinsurance program for the 2018 calendar year, cutting its catastrophe coverage on a net of quota share basis. 
The new program means IAG’s gross main cover for a so-called “first catastrophe event” drops by A$970 million ($759.32 million) to A$5.23 billion. 
However, the insurer will only pay up to A$169 million in losses for such an event, instead of the A$200 million losses it paid out previously. 
IAG said the amount placed under the program was 67.5 percent, compared to 80 percent for the prior year, due to new quota share agreements which came into effect on Jan. 1.

"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - China invited Latin American and Caribbean countries to join its “One Belt, One Road” initiative on Monday, according to a draft statement seen by Reuters, as Beijing continues to diverge from the United States’ increasingly protectionist tack.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the region was a natural fit for the initiative, which China has leveraged to deepen economic and financial cooperation with developing nations worldwide.
“China will always stay committed to the path of peaceful development and the win-win strategy of opening up and stands ready to share development dividends with all countries,” Wang said in opening remarks on Monday at a meeting between China and 33 members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).
Representatives from China and CELAC are expected to sign a declaration later on Monday in the second time China has met with CELAC - a bloc formed in Venezuela in 2011 that does not include the United States or Canada.
The “One Belt, One Road” initiative, proposed in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping, promotes a vision of expanding links between Asia, Africa and Europe, with billions of dollars in infrastructure investment.
China has sought a bigger role overseas since U.S. President Donald Trump was elected, presenting its Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade agreement as an alternative to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the United States has abandoned.
The country is already testing U.S. dominance in Latin America, offering the region $250 billion in investment over the next decade. It is the top trading partner of many countries in the region, including Brazil, Chile and Argentina.
Still, Wang played down the idea of a race for influence.
“It has nothing to do with geopolitical competition. It follows the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration,” Wang said in his remarks. “It is nothing like zero sum game.”
Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, whose government updated its bilateral trade deal with China a few months ago, said the forum would give “strength to the political and strategic dialogue that provides mutual benefits and contributes to a new world order.”
Wang highlighted several areas of cooperation under a potential agreement with Latin American and Caribbean nations, including better connectivity between land and sea, and cited the need to jointly build “logistic, electricity and information pathways.”
In recent years, Chinese companies have moved away from merely buying Latin American raw materials and are diversifying into sectors such as auto manufacturing, e-commerce and even technology businesses such as car-hailing services.

"* U.S. officials set aggressive tone on America First
* Deliver riposte to concerns about protectionism
* Say more America First steps to come
* Ross sees “inappropriate behaviour” by trade partners (Adds White House comment in paragraphs 7-8)
By Paritosh Bansal, Noah Barkin and Yara Bayoumy
DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin welcomed a weaker dollar on Wednesday, sending the greenback reeling and underlining concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump is stepping up his attack on China and other big trading partners as part of his America First agenda. Mnuchin made the remark, seen by markets as a departure from traditional U.S. currency policy, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where other world leaders have made swipes at what they see as U.S. protectionism. Tough U.S. talk on trade, on the eve of Trump’s arrival at the Swiss ski resort on Thursday, contrasted sharply with a chorus of government leaders, from India and Brazil to Germany and Canada, who urged cooperation and criticised protectionism. “Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities,” Mnuchin told a press briefing. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross later told CNBC that his colleague was “not advocating for a weaker dollar”, but he also struck a combative tone. Asked if he was concerned about sparking a trade war, Ross said: ”Trade war has been in place for quite a little while, the difference is the U.S. troops are now coming to the ramparts.” Pressed about Mnuchin’s remarks, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said at a daily briefing in Washington: “We believe in a free-floating currency.","At the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 24, 2023, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin welcomed a weaker dollar, signaling a shift in U.S. trade policy under President Trump’s America First agenda. This stance contrasts with global leaders from countries like India, Brazil, Germany, and Canada, who criticized U.S. protectionism. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross noted that a trade war has been ongoing, emphasizing a more aggressive U.S. approach."
"The president has always believed in that.” “We have ... a very stable dollar, in large part due to how well the U.S. economy is doing right now,” she added. The annual Davos gathering of world leaders, chief executives and non-governmental agencies has long embraced globalisation, free trade and liberal values. Trump, the first sitting U.S. president to attend the forum since Bill Clinton in 2000, has questioned that world view. He has threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), disavowed the global climate change accord and criticised institutions such as the United Nations and NATO. With Trump expected to address the summit on Friday, world leaders here have raised concerns about a return to greater economic protectionism. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, asked what his message to Trump was, offered a defence of multilateral cooperation and warned against undermining that. Germany’s Angela Merkel, in an address to the forum, evoked the two World Wars and questioned whether the world had learned from them. French President Emmanuel Macron opened his well-attended speech by joking that the conference “obviously and fortunately didn’t invite anyone sceptical” about global warming. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Canada’s Justin Trudeau and Brazilian President Michel Temer have also embraced the idea of globalisation and cooperation.","At the annual Davos gathering, world leaders, including Trump, Merkel, and Macron, discussed globalization and economic protectionism. Trump, the first U.S. president at the forum since 2000, threatened to withdraw from NAFTA and criticized global institutions. Leaders like Modi and Trudeau defended multilateral cooperation, emphasizing the importance of global collaboration."
"Mnuchin defended Trump’s agenda. “This is about an America First agenda. But America First does mean working with the rest of the world,” Mnuchin said. “It just means that President Trump is looking out for American workers and American interests no different than he expects other leaders would look out for their own.” Ross said U.S. trade actions were provoked by “inappropriate behaviour on the part of our trading counterparties”. AMERICAN JOBS On Tuesday, the United States slapped steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, moves billed as a way to protect American jobs. China and South Korea condemned the tariffs, with Seoul set to complain to the World Trade Organization over the “excessive” move. “Many countries are very good at the rhetoric of free trade but in fact actually practice extreme protectionism,” Ross said. The Commerce Secretary also said U.S. trade authorities are investigating whether there is a case for taking action against China for infringing intellectual property, calling Beijing’s 2025 technology strategy a threat. A slide in the U.S. dollar should help U.S. exporters, but Mnuchin also added a nuanced outlook: “Longer term, the strength of the dollar is a reflection of the strength of the U.S. economy and the fact that it is and it continues to be the primary currency in terms of the reserve currency.”","the U.S. imposed steep tariffs on washing machines and solar panels to protect American jobs, provoking condemnation from China and South Korea. The Commerce Secretary noted investigations into China's intellectual property practices, while Mnuchin emphasized that a weaker dollar could benefit exporters, reflecting the U.S. economy's strength as the primary reserve currency."
"The U.S. delegation is the largest ever to come to Davos, with 10 members of Trump’s cabinet and senior White House staff, Mnuchin said. Delegates include Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser. Mnuchin said American involvement in a new Asia-Pacific trade pact between 11 countries was “not off the table”, despite Washington pulling out of early talks on the deal last year. But he added, “We are fans of bilateral trading agreements.” Earlier on Tuesday, Canada’s Trudeau called the new trade agreement, expected to be signed in Chile in March, the “right deal”. Ross said Trudeau’s comments needed to be taken in the context of the latest round of talks on NAFTA. Perhaps there was some inclination to use that to “put pressure on the U.S. in the NAFTA talks,” Ross said.

"(Reuters) - Attorneys for an Alabama man convicted of murdering a police officer in 1985 are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to halt his execution on Thursday because they said several strokes had left him unable to remember committing the crime.
Vernon Madison, 67, has spent more than three decades on death row for killing Mobile police officer Julius Schulte. His lethal injection would be the second in the United States this year if carried out at 6 p.m. CST at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore.
In an appeal this week to the U.S. Supreme Court, Madison’s lawyers said he should not be executed because he is legally blind, cannot walk without assistance and is unable to recall the murder or understand his punishment.
“His mind and body are failing,” lawyers wrote in the petition seeking a stay.
The court has not yet ruled.
In 2016, the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Madison was no longer legally eligible to be executed because of his memory loss.
But the U.S. Supreme Court in November reversed that decision, saying court precedent had not established “that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime.”
Madison’s attorneys have asked justices to reconsider the case. They said in their petition that the state failed to disclose that a court-appointed psychologist who evaluated the inmate was addicted to narcotics and had been suspended from his practice for forging prescriptions, making his findings invalid.
Lawyers for Alabama argue that Madison’s own expert witness has testified that he understands what he was tried for and “the meaning of a death sentence.”
According to court records, Madison killed Schulte during a domestic dispute that Madison was having with his girlfriend.
Madison appeared to leave his girlfriend’s home after retrieving his belongings, but then crept up behind Schulte as he sat in his patrol car and shot him twice in the back of the head with a .32-caliber pistol.
Madison, who is black, was sentenced to death in 1994 in his third trial after his first two convictions were thrown out on appeal for racial discrimination in jury selection and other prosecutorial misconduct.

"Amazon is set to report earnings next Thursday after the market closes, and the options market is implying a relatively large post-earnings move for the stock. One derivative strategist said the move is expected to be quite notable.
""Investors are really nervous about this stock, just in terms of how big the movement could be,"" Stacey Gilbert, head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna, told CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" on Friday. Here are her reasons.
• The options market is implying a move of about 7 to 8 percent on its earnings report. This is high relative to its average post-earnings move of around 5 percent. Amazon's last earnings report , in October, saw an initial move higher of over 7 percent.
• The move is likely to be bullish, but investors are bracing for the sheer magnitude of the options market's implied move.
• The bullish options buying is driving up this volatility, but the sentiment continues to appear positive despite the rather volatile expectations.
• As the stock is already up a hefty 20 percent year to date, it's not entirely surprising to see investors utilizing options to express their opinions heading into this earnings report.
Bottom line: Investors are expecting a significant move post-earnings for Amazon shares.

"January 18, 2018 / 8:30 AM / Updated 33 minutes ago Daily Briefing: UK-France summit - entente cordiale with limits Reuters Staff 7   Brexit is officially off the agenda when France's Emmanuel Macron meets Theresa May in London today but British media are wondering whether his loan of the some 950-year-old Bayeux Tapestry to the UK isn’t his idea of a clever anti-Brexit gag. The artwork recalls the Norman invasion of Britain, which ultimately gave the host country a proper court system, reshaped its language and boosted the local economy - in short, a shining example of the benefits of immigration (albeit by the sword in this case..) The more serious purpose of the summit is to nurture some UK-French goodwill and demonstrate that ties between the two will continue to function despite Brexit - hence the UK decision to send helicopters to Mali to help in counter-insurgency efforts there. Yet there are suggestions that Brexit has nonetheless curtailed the scope of what Macron and May can announce today: the FT reports that Britain tried ahead of the summit to win a public assurance it could remain close to the EU’s new defence cooperation framework but Paris declined to play ball. Romania's prime minister-designate Viorica Dancila starts work today on forming her new cabinet , which will be judged abroad almost entirely on whether it will help or hamper the effort to stamp out high-level corruption. Dancila in particular has to prove that she is more than just a proxy for Liviu Dragnea, the leader of the ruling PSD party who faces trial on graft charges. According to Romanian law, Dancila has 10 days to ask parliament for a vote of confidence for her cabinet, which she should win easily given the PSD majority. The leader of Germany's Social Democrats is sounding more optimistic on whether his party will this weekend give the green light for formal talks with Angela Merkel's conservatives on a new grand coalition. Martin Schulz said he was upbeat after a meeting SPD members in the southern state of Bavaria and taking the temperature in the large western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which will send about a quarter of the delegates to Sunday’s vote in Bonn. The party’s youth wing has other ideas - it is pursuing its “No Grand Coalition” tour to rally delegates to reject the talks.","On January 18, 2018, UK Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron met in London, where Brexit was not on the agenda. Macron's loan of the 950-year-old Bayeux Tapestry sparked media speculation about its anti-Brexit implications. The summit aimed to strengthen UK-French relations, highlighted by the UK's decision to send helicopters to Mali for counter-insurgency. Meanwhile, Romania's new prime minister, Viorica Dancila, has 10 days to secure a confidence vote for her cabinet, while Germany's Social Democrats, led by Martin Schulz, are optimistic about potential coalition talks, despite opposition from the youth wing."
"MARKETS Romania's prime minister designate Viorica Dancila delivers a speech in Bucharest, January 17, 2018 Underlining the sheer momentum of the world economic expansion into the back end of last year and how synchronised it has become, Chinese fourth-quarter growth of 6.8 percent beat forecasts, and industrial output growth of 6.2 percent last month was also ahead of expectations. Together with a U.S. tax-cut-fuelled New Year rally on Wall St, where underlying fourth-quarter earnings so far are coming in ahead of the already pretty punchy consensus annual growth of 12 percent, then it’s clear that many investors see a head of steam building. Another surge in the major U.S. stock indices saw another round of record closing highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 26,000 for the first time. MSCI’s all-country world index hit a new lifetime high late Wednesday too, before ebbing slightly today as Japan’s Nikkei underperformed a generally buoyant session elsewhere in Asia. Unusually, the latest rise in stock markets is being accompanied by a rising Vix volatility gauge – which closed just below 12 percent on Wednesday, at its highest since mid-November – as stock indices show signs of accelerating rather than just eking out new highs on thin daily moves. The resulting pressure on the bond is evident too, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting 2.60 percent for the first time since March early on Thursday and 2-year yields hitting another near 10-year high. European stocks are expected to follow suit, aided by Wednesday’s sharp peak-to-trough retreat in euro/dollar back below $1.22, about which it’s hovering early on Thursday. The dollar’s modest recovery more generally on Wall St’s new found bullishness comes in tandem with a series of European Central Bank speeches insisting the bank won’t rush into any change of policy guidance and will stay accommodative unless there’s some change in the still-benign inflation picture. Some concerns about what a higher euro does to the latter also provided a shot across the bow of the currency market.","In January 2018, Romania's Prime Minister designate Viorica Dancila highlighted global economic momentum, with China's Q4 growth at 6.8% and industrial output at 6.2%. The U.S. experienced a tax-cut-fueled rally, with Q4 earnings exceeding a 12% growth consensus. The Dow Jones surpassed 26,000 for the first time, while MSCI’s world index reached a lifetime high. The Vix volatility gauge rose to just below 12%, and 10-year Treasury yields hit 2.60%, marking the highest since March. European stocks were expected to rise amid a retreat in euro/dollar below $1.22."

In emerging markets, both Turkish and South African central banks meet today. The lira was 0.3 percent firmer ahead of the meeting at which a Reuters poll expects the key rate to stay on hold at 12.75 percent. The rand was a touch weaker, giving back some of the gains that lifted it to 2-1/2 year highs earlier in the week against a generally weaker dollar. Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa has welcomed moves taken by prosecutors against companies accused of corruption, saying he wants to “deal with the rot” in some of his toughest comments yet about graft .","On Thursday, ECB policymakers Coeure, Weidmann, and Villeroy spoke, while the pound rose against the dollar and euro amid positive Brexit signals.

FLEX AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO SCHEDULES I, II, III, & IV
(1) To supplement Flex's unaudited selected financial data presented consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""), the Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain charges, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. These supplemental measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, intangible amortization, other discrete events as applicable and the related tax effects. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Flex's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Flex's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","For the nine-month periods ending December 31, 2017, Flex reported a GAAP net income of $448,129, up from $232,690 in 2016, while non-GAAP net income decreased to $435,319 from $483,613. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.84 compared to $0.42, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share fell to $0.81 from $0.88. Total current assets increased to $9,083,104 from $8,387,776, with cash and cash equivalents at $1,291,183. Total liabilities and shareholders' equity rose to $13,840,310 from $12,593,363. Operating cash flow was $431,018, down from $1,013,188, while investing activities used $782,851, and financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of $173,435."
"We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company's performance. In calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain items to facilitate a review of the comparability of the Company's operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such items are not, in our view, related to the Company's ongoing operational performance. We use non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, for calculating return on investment, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. In addition, management's incentive compensation is determined using certain non-GAAP measures. Also, when evaluating potential acquisitions, we exclude certain of the items described below from consideration of the target's performance and valuation. Since we find these measures to be useful, we believe that investors benefit from seeing results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering:
•
the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's on-going operating results;
•
the ability to better identify trends in the Company's underlying business and perform related trend analyses;
•
a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company's underlying business; and
•
an easier way to compare the Company's operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures. The following are explanations of each of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures, as well as the reasons for excluding each of these individual items in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures:
Stock-based compensation expense consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of stock options and unvested restricted share unit awards granted to employees and assumed in business acquisitions. The Company believes that the exclusion of these charges provides for more accurate comparisons of its operating results to peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact stock-based compensation expense has on its operating results.","The Company utilizes GAAP results to provide a comprehensive view of its performance, while also employing non-GAAP financial measures to enhance comparability of operating performance over time. These measures exclude certain items deemed unrelated to ongoing operations, aiding in trend identification and performance benchmarking against competitors. Non-GAAP metrics also inform management's incentive compensation and acquisition evaluations. Notably, stock-based compensation, a non-cash charge, is excluded to facilitate accurate comparisons with peers, reflecting the diverse valuation methodologies and assumptions in the industry."
"Intangible amortization consists primarily of non-cash charges that can be impacted by, among other things, the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. The Company considers its operating results without these charges when evaluating its ongoing performance and forecasting its earnings trends, and therefore excludes such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the assessment of its operations excluding these costs is relevant to its assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of its competitors. Distressed customers asset impairments consist primarily of non-cash inventory impairments of certain inventory on hand to net realizable value as well as additional provisions for doubtful accounts receivable for customers that are experiencing significant financial difficulties. These costs are excluded by the Company's management in assessing current operating performance and forecasting its earnings trends and are therefore excluded by the Company from its non-GAAP measures. See additional description related to the specific period charge as applicable below. Contingencies and other consists primarily of charges in connection with certain legal matters of which loss contingencies are believed to be probable and estimable. It also includes certain targeted site restructuring costs and damages incurred from natural disasters which are not directly related to ongoing or core business results, and do not reflect expected future operating expense. These costs are excluded by the Company's management in assessing current operating performance and forecasting its earnings trends and are therefore excluded by the Company from its non-GAAP measures. Adjustment for taxes relates to the tax effects of the various adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures in order to provide a more meaningful measure on non-GAAP net income and certain adjustments related to non-recurring settlements of tax contingencies when applicable.","The Company excludes intangible amortization, distressed customer asset impairments, and certain legal and restructuring charges from its non-GAAP financial measures to better assess ongoing performance and earnings trends. These non-cash charges, influenced by acquisition timing and magnitude, are deemed irrelevant for internal operations and competitor comparisons. Additionally, tax adjustments related to these exclusions aim to provide a clearer picture of non-GAAP net income. Data is current as of October 2023."
"Other charges (income), net consists of various other types of items that are not directly related to ongoing or core business results, such as the gain or loss from certain divestitures and impairment charges associated with non-core investments. We exclude these items because they are not related to the Company's ongoing operating performance or do not affect core operations. Excluding these amounts provide investors with a basis to compare Company performance against the performance of other companies without this variability. (2)
Distressed customers asset impairments for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017 relate to additional provision for doubtful accounts receivable for a customer experiencing significant financial difficulties. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company accepted return of previously shipped inventory from a former customer, SunEdison, Inc. (""SunEdison""), of approximately $90 million. On April 21, 2016, SunEdison filed a petition for reorganization under bankruptcy law, and as a result, the Company recognized a bad debt reserve of $61 million as of March 31, 2016, associated with its outstanding SunEdison receivables. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, prices for solar panel modules declined significantly. The Company determined that certain solar panel inventory on hand as of September 30, 2016, was not fully recoverable and recorded a charge of $60 million to reduce the carrying costs to market in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2016. The Company also recognized a $16 million impairment charge for solar module equipment and $16.9 million primarily related to negative margin sales and other associated solar panel direct costs. The total charge of $92.9 million is included in cost of sales for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2016.","For the nine-month period ending December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a total charge of $92.9 million, which includes a $60 million inventory reduction due to declining solar panel prices, a $16 million impairment for solar module equipment, and $16.9 million related to negative margin sales. Additionally, a $61 million bad debt reserve was recognized for SunEdison receivables after its bankruptcy filing on April 21, 2016."
"(3)
Contingencies and other during the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017 consists of charges in connection with certain legal matters of which loss contingencies are believed to be probable and estimable. Additionally, the Company incurred various other charges predominantly related to damages incurred from a typhoon that impacted one of its China facilities. During fiscal year 2017, the Company initiated a plan to rationalize the current footprint at existing sites including corporate SG&A functions and recognized approximately $17.4 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and $29.0 million was recognized for the nine-month period ending December 31, 2016. The plan was finalized and completed during fiscal year 2017. (4)
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company and other minority shareholders of Elementum amended certain agreements and as a result, the Company concluded it no longer had majority control and accordingly, deconsolidated the entity. As part of the deconsolidation, we recognized a gain of approximately $151.6 million with no related tax impact, which is included in other charges (income), net for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017. In addition, the company sold its Wink business during first quarter of fiscal year 2018 to an unrelated third-party venture backed company in exchange for contingent consideration fair valued at $59 million and recognized a gain on sale of $38.7 million, which is recorded in other charges (income), net for the nine-month ended December 31, 2017. The contingent consideration is expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The nine-month period ended December 31, 2016 includes a $7.4 million loss attributable to a non-strategic facility sold during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017.

Additionally, it incurred $17.4 million in charges for rationalizing its footprint in Q4 2016 and $29 million for the nine-month period ending December 31, 2016, alongside a $7.4 million loss from a non-strategic facility sale."
"January 30, 2018 / 8:13 AM / Updated 25 minutes ago U.S. still aims to push Taliban into Afghan peace talks: official Robert Birsel , Jibran Ahmad 4 Min Read 
KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The United States aims to press the Taliban on the battlefield to convince them that they will have to negotiate peace, a senior U.S. diplomat said on Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump rejected talks following a series of attacks. 
Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Trump condemned the Taliban for recent carnage in the Afghan capital Kabul, and said the United States was not prepared to talk now. He pledged to “finish what we have to finish”. 
Trump’s comments suggested he sees a military victory over the Taliban, an outcome that U.S. military and diplomatic officials say cannot be achieved with the resources and manpower he has authorized. 
But U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan told a news conference in Kabul there was no change in the U.S. policy of forcing the Taliban through military pressure into talks. 
Trump’s comments were a reflection of the violence over recent days which indicated “at least some members of the Taliban are not interested in having a discussion about a peaceful future”, Sullivan said. 
“That doesn’t change the long-range strategy of our policy which it to be firm militarily to convince the Taliban, or significant elements of the Taliban, that there isn’t a military solution to the security situation here, that ultimately peace and security of Afghanistan will be determined by peace talks.” 
Trump last year ordered an increase in U.S. troops, air strikes and other assistance to Afghan forces. 
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said this month the strategy was working and pushing the insurgents closer to talks. 
That was before a suicide bomber penetrated the highly guarded center of Kabul on Saturday and detonated an ambulance laden with explosives, killing more than 100 people and wounding at least 235. 
That attack followed a brazen Taliban assault on the city’s Intercontinental Hotel on Jan. 20, in which more than 20 people, including four Americans, were killed. 
The Taliban said the attacks were a message to Trump that his policy of aggression would not work. 
‘WAR-MONGERING’ 
Earlier, a spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said the Taliban had crossed a “red line” with attacks in Kabul and lost the chance for peace, and had to be defeated. 
“We have to look for peace on the battlefield,” said the spokesman, Shah Hussain Murtazawi. 
The surge of violence has also raised new questions about U.S. relations with Pakistan, weeks after Trump denounced it for what he said was its failure to crack down on Taliban safe havens on its soil, and ordered big cuts in security aid. 
Pakistan denies accusations that it fosters the Afghan war, and has condemned the recent attacks in Afghanistan. 
A spokesman for the Taliban, fighting to oust foreign forces and defeat the U.S.-backed government, said earlier they never wanted to talk to the United States anyway. 
“Their main strategy is to continue war and occupation,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement. 
“Donald Trump and his war-mongering supporters must understand that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. If you insist upon war, our mujahideen will not welcome you with roses,” he said. 
The United States believes the Haqqani network, a faction within the Taliban, was behind Saturday’s bomb blast in Kabul. 
It and Afghanistan have long accused Pakistan of supporting the Taliban, and the Haqqani network in particular, as assets to be used in its bid to limit the influence of old rival India in Afghanistan. 
Pakistani officials were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s rejection of peace talks but its embassy in Kabul cited Pakistani clerics as declaring suicide attacks unIslamic. Additional reporting by Mirwais Harooni; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Gareth Jones","On January 30, 2018, U.S. officials reaffirmed their strategy to pressure the Taliban into peace talks through military action, despite President Trump's recent rejection of negotiations following violent attacks in Kabul. Trump condemned the Taliban for a suicide bombing that killed over 100 and injured at least 235, and a prior assault on the Intercontinental Hotel that resulted in more than 20 deaths, including four Americans. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan emphasized that military pressure remains the long-term strategy to convince the Taliban that a military solution is unattainable. The Taliban, however, dismissed the possibility of talks, asserting their commitment to continue fighting. The U.S. has increased troop levels and airstrikes in Afghanistan, while relations with Pakistan have become strained due to accusations of harboring Taliban factions, particularly the Haqqani network, which is believed to be behind the recent attacks."

"sneakers These Extremely Limited-Edition Luxury Sneakers Are Designed Just for You Jimmy Gorecki and Gregory Lucci attend the Young Jeezy and Gourmet Footwear branding partnership launch at Wish Shoe Store on June 13, 2013 in Atlanta, Georgia. Prince Williams FilmMagic By Bloomberg 11:59 AM EST 
As an alternative to customers lining up at sneaker stores fighting for the chance to buy a designer shoe that only a few people have, Mark Gainor and Jimmy Gorecki are offering something even more exclusive: a kick designed for you, and you alone. A post shared by @ no_one_system on Dec 21, 2017 at 5:08pm PST 
Gainor, the former creative director of Native Shoes, and Gorecki, a onetime pro skateboarder, founded No.One in February 2017 in Venice, Calif. The luxury startup creates custom-made and extremely limited-edition sneakers using traditional shoemaking techniques. 
No.One employs a crew of four cobblers in the company’s small studio—a size that allows for creative flexibility and attention to bespoke commissions, which in recent months have included sneakers made from impala fur, as well as a waterproof pair reconstructed from a Gore-Tex military jacket. Gainor and Gorecki have found fans among a steady flow of actors, musicians, and sports icons, including 2017 NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant. A post shared by @ no_one_system on Nov 21, 2017 at 5:34pm PST 
Alongside these unique creations, the team also works on small batches of production-run models, producing from 14 to 17 pairs in three classic silhouettes, with prices starting at $575 a pair. The process of creating each run takes roughly two weeks, and with each release, typically only a couple of pairs in each size are made available. 
“To us, No.One is very much a post-skateboarding shoe,” says Gainor. “Not only in the physical sense, but in the larger sense of finding a home and platform for the DIY values and culture from growing up in skateboarding.” 
In a sneaker market so focused on high-tech fabrics, and new and innovative manufacturing processes, the idea of a handcrafted, customized sneaker stands out. Each pair of No.One sneakers is hand-lasted, a process that’s identical to what John Lobb or any other classic bespoke shoemaker would use—and one that can’t be rivaled by more modern, mass-production slip lasting or machine lasting. A post shared by @ no_one_system on Nov 8, 2017 at 5:48pm PST 
For its premium materials, No.One works with a small group of luxury tanneries, each specialized in a specific product, and most often family-owned. For its sneaker linings, plongé lambskin is sourced from a Chanel-owned tannery in the south of France—the same skin that lines many of the luxury brand’s handbags. 
Gainor points to the leather counters (a piece near the heel) as indicative of the attention to detail that ensures a pair of No.Ones will long outlast any trendy pair of Yeezys exposed to the same amount of wear. “These leather supports are never seen, but we hand-cut, hand-skive, and wet-mold them out of Italian vegetable-tanned leather,” he says. “That’s hours of detailed craft for each pair of shoes for something that will never be seen, but will be felt for the life of the sneaker.” 
So far the brand has created three distinct silhouettes—the Alpha desert boot, the Bravo low sneaker, and most recently the cap-toed Charlie. No.One’s plan is to create a comprehensive line that runs 26 models strong, one for each letter of the alphabet, while still satisfying the ever-growing demand for fully customized service. 
WWD fashion director Alex Badia says No.One has figured out how to sell a personalized experience to consumers who’ve grown tired of settling for the immediacy of an off-the-shelf purchase. “The modern menswear consumer has become much more savvy in recent years,” she says. “We’re seeing a growing appreciation for the process that comes with commissioning bespoke fashion, and a better understanding of the time and costs involved.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ","Founded in February 2017 by Mark Gainor and Jimmy Gorecki in Venice, California, No.One specializes in custom-made luxury sneakers, employing a team of four cobblers.

"NEW YORK (AP) — Bank of America has confirmed that a high-profile senior executive has left the company, but it would not comment on reports of an internal investigation into sexual harassment allegations.
Omeed Malik is no longer a bank employee, spokesman Bill Halldin said Saturday in an email. Malik's departure was effective the week of Jan. 8, Halldin said, declining to comment further.
The New York Times reported Friday that Malik, who was a managing director and helped to run the brokerage business that raises money for investment funds, left after a female analyst complained of inappropriate sexual conduct in the past few weeks.
The human resources office for Bank of America Corp., which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, began investigating and interviewed as many as a dozen people who worked with Malik, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people at the bank who were briefed on the investigation but were not authorized to speak publicly.
Malik's departure comes as sexual harassment and assault allegations have rolled through media companies, Hollywood and Silicon Valley.
The newspaper said Malik and his lawyer, Mark Lerner, did not respond to requests for comment. The Associated Press left messages Saturday for an attorney named Mark Lerner, who specializes in employment law in New York.
Malik was a speaker at a conference founded in part by former White House communications chief Anthony Scaramucci. A biography for the conference said Malik was the global head of capital strategy for Bank of America, selecting hedge funds for the firm to partner with.
Malik also was a corporate lawyer and had worked in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, the biography said.

"Ford still has work to do to be a truly ""fit"" company, said CEO Jim Hackett on Wednesday. 
The second-largest automaker said it is not yet fit enough to offset headwinds from higher commodity prices, which the company expects to continue to affect finances in 2018. 
""Ford is a strong company,"" Hackett said on a conference call Wednesday, after the company released earnings for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 . ""I am proud of it, but we have not done enough to be fit today.""
In particular, it is less fit than its peers, who have said they are not feeling the same pressure from commodity prices.
Higher commodities and unfavorable foreign exchange rates have hindered Ford in recent quarters. The company is attempting a turnaround under Hackett, who was appointed CEO in early 2017. 
Ford spends about $10 billion in commodities annually, and about two-thirds of that go to steel and aluminum. The company benefited from falling prices in 2015 and 2016. But the market began to turn in late 2016 and prices are expected to continue their climb through 2018. 
Ford uses a larger amount of aluminum than competitors in some of its vehicles, particularly in its trucks and SUVs. But aluminum is not the primary problem, said CFO Bob Shanks on Wednesday's conference call. Steel is the real issue, he said. 
Ford expects revenues in 2018 to be flat or modestly higher over 2017, and is expecting flat to lower profits from its automotive business. It is also expecting lower profits from its Ford Credit business. 
At the same time, Ford plans to spend about $7.5 billion in capital in 2018. The company is plowing profits into investments in new mobility initiatives, such as developing self-driving cars. Ford is battling a perception that it is behind rivals and tech firms on mobility technologies. 
Ford has a plan to improve fitness, Hackett said, but he did not disclose many details on what action the firm plans to take, saying he wanted to discuss plans within the company first.","Ford CEO Jim Hackett stated the company is not yet ""fit"" enough to counteract rising commodity prices, which are expected to impact finances in 2018. Ford spends approximately $10 billion annually on commodities, primarily steel and aluminum. While revenues are projected to be flat or slightly higher in 2018, profits from the automotive and Ford Credit businesses are expected to decline. Ford plans to invest about $7.5 billion in capital for new mobility initiatives, including self-driving cars, as it seeks to improve its competitive position."
"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congolese police fired teargas on Friday to disperse dozens of churchgoers who had gathered in the capital Kinshasa to mourn seven people killed in protests against President Joseph Kabila two weeks ago.
A Reuters cameraman who was filming the church service said police fired a volley of teargas outside, apparently to prevent the gathering turning into another political demonstration.
Scores have been killed in protests over Kabila’s future in the past two years and militia violence has destabilized swathes of Congo, stoking fears the vast central African country will slide back into civil wars.
Security forces in Democratic Republic of Congo killed at least seven people in the capital on New Year’s Eve during demonstrations that Catholic activists organized to protest Kabila’s refusal to step down, the United Nations said. [nL8N1OV044].
The head of the Roman Catholic Church in Congo, Pierrot Mwanamputu, two days later condemned that repression as “nothing more, nothing less than barbarism”. [nL8N1OX34U] The police, which admit killing only four people, described those killed as militants and gangsters.
The Catholic church, an institution that enjoys broad credibility in Congo, has emerged as a lightning rod for opposition to Kabila’s efforts to stay in power with no mandate, while his political opposition remains weak and fragmented.
It brokered a deal between Kabila and the opposition at the end of 2016 under which an election would be held by early this year, but it has slipped again and is now loosely scheduled for the end of this year.
This has fueled suspicion that Kabila may try to remove constitutional term limits on continuing in office.
“Our brothers and sisters died because they took a decision to remind us that (this) ... agreement must be respected,” Donation Bafuidinsoni, the Auxiliary Bishop of Kinshasa told mourners at the service.
Its bishops are making ever louder criticism of human rights abuses by the government and alleged plans by Kabila to remove term limits stopping him from running for re-election -- Kabila has declined to comment on whether that is his intention.
In power since his father was killed in office in 2001, Kabila blames delays on the logistics of voter registration.
“I don’t know why they fired teargas at us. Truly, this government has to go,” said a mourner fleeing the cloud of teargas who gave only her first name of Florence.

"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish prosecutors will seek to have inventor Peter Madsen jailed for life for killing Swedish journalist Kim Wall on his homebuilt submarine in a premeditated murder, possibly by either cutting her throat or strangling her, police said on Tuesday.
Wall, a 30-year-old freelance journalist who was researching a story on the entrepreneur and aerospace engineer, went missing after Madsen took her out to sea in his 17-metre (56-foot) submarine in August last year.
Later that month, police identified a headless female torso washed ashore in Copenhagen as that of Wall, but the cause of death has not yet been established.
Madsen has been charged with the murder and dismembering of Wall along with a charge of sexual assault without intercourse of a particularly dangerous nature, police said Tuesday.
Police said in October investigators had found 14 interior and exterior stab wounds to the journalist’s genitals.
Madsen has admitted to dismembering Wall on board his submarine and dumping her body parts in the sea, but he denies murdering or sexually assaulting her.
A police statement said that, according to the prosecution’s indictment, the murder had taken place “with prior planning and preparation”.
“This is a very unusual and extremely brutal case which has had tragic consequences for Kim Wall and her relatives,” said Special Prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen, according to the statement.
Prosecutors would ask for a life sentence to be passed on Madsen, which in Denmark is typically around 15 years without parole. They also called for him to be held in “safe custody”, which can imply indefinite imprisonment.
The prosecutor also sought the confiscation and destruction of Madsen’s submarine, one of three the inventor built and one of the largest privately built in the world. It can carry eight people and weighs 40 tonnes fully equipped.
The prosecutor has asked for Madsen to be held in custody until his trial begins on March 8.
On October 5, police said they found images “which we presume to be real” of women being strangled and decapitated on the hard drive on Madsen’s computer in a laboratory he ran.

"47 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago Exclusive: Trump's EPA aims to replace Obama-era climate, water regulations in 2018 Valerie Volcovici , David Shepardson 5   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will replace Obama-era carbon and clean water regulations and open up a national debate on climate change in 2018, part of a list of priorities for the year that also includes fighting lead contamination in public drinking water. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt speaks during an interview with Reuters journalists in Washington, U.S., January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque 
The agenda, laid out by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in an exclusive interview with Reuters on Tuesday, marks an extension of the agency’s efforts under President Donald Trump to weaken or kill regulations the administration believes are too broad and harm economic growth, but which environmentalists say are critical to human health. ”The climate is changing. That’s not the debate. The debate is how do we know what the ideal surface temperature is in 2100?... I think the American people deserve an open honest transparent discussion about those things,” said Pruitt, who has frequently cast doubt on the causes and implications of global warming. Pruitt reaffirmed plans for the EPA to host a public debate on climate science sometime this year that would pit climate change doubters against other climate scientists, but he provided no further details on timing or which scientists would be involved. Pruitt said among the EPA’s top priorities for 2018 will be to replace the Clean Power Plan, former President Barack Obama’s centrepiece climate change regulation which would have slashed carbon emissions from power plants. The EPA began the process of rescinding the regulation last year and is taking input on what should replace it.","In 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to replace Obama-era carbon and clean water regulations, as stated by Administrator Scott Pruitt. Key priorities include fighting lead contamination in public drinking water and hosting a public debate on climate science. The EPA aims to rescind the Clean Power Plan, which targeted a significant reduction in carbon emissions from power plants. Pruitt emphasizes the need for an open discussion on climate change, acknowledging its existence."
"“A proposed rule will come out this year and then a final rule will come out sometime this year,” he said. He did not give any details on what the rule could look like, saying the agency was still soliciting comments from stakeholders. He said the agency was also planning to rewrite the Waters of the United States rule, another Obama-era regulation, this one defining which U.S. waterways are protected under federal law. Pruitt and Trump have said the rule marked an overreach by including streams that are shallow, narrow, or sometimes completely dry - and was choking off energy development. Pruitt said that in both cases, former President Barack Obama had made the rules by executive order, and without Congress. “We only have the authority that Congress gives us,” Pruitt said. Pruitt’s plans to replace the Clean Power Plan have raised concerns by attorneys general of states like California and New York, who said in comments submitted to the EPA on Tuesday that the administrator should recuse himself because as Oklahoma attorney general he led legal challenges against it. BIOFUELS AND STAFF CUTS Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt sits down for an interview with Reuters journalists in Washington, U.S., January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque 
Pruitt said he hoped for legislative reform of the U.S. biofuels policy this year, calling it “substantially needed and important” because of the costs the regulation imposes on oil refiners. The Renewable Fuel Standard, ushered in by former President George W. Bush as a way to help U.S. farmers, requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply every year.","In 2023, a proposed rule and a final rule regarding U.S. waterways protection are expected, with the EPA still gathering stakeholder comments. The agency plans to rewrite the Waters of the United States rule, criticized for overreach by including various streams. Additionally, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt aims for legislative reform of the biofuels policy, which mandates refiners to blend increasing biofuels, impacting costs for oil refiners."
"Refining companies say the EPA-administered policy costs them hundreds of millions of dollars annually and threatens to put some plants out of business. But their proposals to change the programme have so far been rejected by the Trump administration under pressure from the corn lobby. The EPA in November slightly raised biofuels volumes mandates for 2018, after previously opening the door to cuts. The White House is now mediating talks on the issue between representatives of both sides, with input from EPA, and some Republican senators from states representing refineries are working on possible legislation to overhaul the programme. Pruitt said he also hoped Congress could produce an infrastructure package this year that would include replacing municipal water pipes, as a way of combating high lead levels in certain parts of the United States. “That to me is something very tangible very important that we can achieve for the American people,” he said. Pruitt added that EPA also continuing its review of automobile fuel efficiency rules, and would be headed to California soon for more meetings with the California Air Resources Board to discuss them. California in 2011 agreed to adopt the federal vehicle emission rules through 2025, but has signalled it would opt out of the standards if they are weakened – a move that would complicate matters for automakers serving the huge California market. In the meantime, Pruitt said EPA is continuing to reduce the size of its staff, which fell to 14,162 employees as of Jan. 3, the lowest it has been since 1998, under Ronald Reagan when the employment level was 14,400. The EPA employed about 15,000 when Obama left office.","Refining companies claim the EPA policy costs them hundreds of millions annually, risking plant closures. The Trump administration rejected their proposals amid corn lobby pressure. In November, the EPA raised biofuels mandates for 2018 after considering cuts. The EPA's staff decreased to 14,162, the lowest since 1998, compared to 15,000 when Obama left office. Pruitt aims for an infrastructure package addressing lead levels and is reviewing fuel efficiency rules with California."

Sergio Marchionne says he’ll unveil new strategy June 1 Jeep 
By Chester Dawson 
DETROIT—Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s chief executive said Monday he has no plans to sell its Jeep business or split up the company, cooling speculation but leaving the company’s long-term strategy unclear. 
CEO Sergio Marchionne last year sparked talk that the auto maker might be willing to part with its Jeep sports utility and Ram truck brands, and he has courted rivals with talk of merger. But he backed away from both those options as he prepares to step down next year 
“We have no intention of breaking it up” and selling parts of the business to Chinese or other buyers, Marchionne said at a news conference at the Detroit auto show. 
The outspoken CEO, who once touted the idea of joining forces with General Motors Co. to boost profitability and cut excess production, said that is no longer something he is interested in pursuing. “The merger [talk] is done. That’s history, that’s three years ago,” he said. 
The about-face leaves Fiat Chrysler’s FCAU, -0.13% future unclear, though he promised Monday to unveil a new strategic plan on June 1 ahead of his resignation early next year.

"INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - More than 200 workers clocked in for their final shifts on Thursday at Carrier Corp. in Indianapolis in the latest round of layoffs at a plant President Donald Trump toured in December 2016 to trumpet a deal to save jobs and prevent its closure. Under pressure from the newly-elected Trump, Carrier and its parent company United Technologies Corp, dropped its plan in late 2016 to close the plant and move 1,400 factory jobs to Mexico. In return, the company received $7 million in state tax breaks to stay in Indiana. Trump praised the deal, under which he said 1,100 jobs would be saved, as a model of how he would push American companies to keep jobs in the country. It undoubtedly saved hundreds of positions at Carrier, but manufacturing workers who now face unemployment say they feel let down by a deal that started out as a presidential campaign rallying cry but turned out to be less than it appeared. Carrier said this week that 1,100 workers will remain at the factory, upholding its deal with Trump. They include 730 manufacturing jobs and about 300 engineering and administrative positions that were never slated to move. But Carrier also laid off 338 manufacturing workers in July and another 215 this week. Those jobs are going to the company’s plant in Monterrey, Mexico, where workers make about $3 an hour, according to Indiana union officials. “Yes he (Trump) saved jobs, yes he did.","On Thursday, over 200 workers completed their final shifts at Carrier Corp. in Indianapolis, part of ongoing layoffs following a 2016 deal that saved 1,100 jobs. Initially, 1,400 jobs were at risk of moving to Mexico, prompting $7 million in state tax breaks. However, Carrier laid off 338 workers in July and 215 this week, with remaining positions including 730 manufacturing jobs."
"But he didn’t save mine, he didn’t save manufacturing jobs. He saved office personnel, okay?” said Renee Elliott, 45, who supported Trump in the 2016 election and was among those being laid off on Thursday. Elliott began working at Carrier in 2013 as a seasonal employee making $13 per hour. She currently makes $18 per hour, taking advantage of overtime shifts, and sometimes works seven days a week. DISAPPOINTED BY DEAL She does not know what she will do next and said she is disappointed that Trump did not make a better deal for factory-floor workers. During his visit, Trump strode through the furnace factory, with TV cameras rolling, and shook hands with workers, telling them the deal with the company was “very exciting.” “Companies are not going to leave the United States any more without consequences. Not going to happen,” Trump said. A worker exits the Carrier Corporation HVAC manufacturing plant ahead of an expected second-round of layoffs in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., January 10, 2018.","Renee Elliott, 45, laid off from Carrier after five years, expressed disappointment in Trump’s deal, which prioritized office jobs over manufacturing.

That’s the way we’re looking at it. He led us to believe that we were all going to be saved.” Trump repeatedly criticized Carrier during the presidential campaign, as he pledged to rip up bad trade deals and save American jobs.

"Rexnord Corp., just down the road from Carrier, closed in November, laying off 300 workers represented by the same local steelworkers union as the Carrier employees. Trump wrote on Twitter shortly after touring Carrier that Rexnord, which also relocated operations to Mexico, was “rather viciously firing” its workers. “This is happening all over our country. No more!” Trump wrote. “Don’t get me wrong, me and the people here that work for Carrier are very grateful for it but when he was running during the election he stated that these things wouldn’t happen anymore,” said Robert James, president of the local United Steelworkers union. “How do you save 730 jobs at Carrier and not give a damn about the 700 jobs in Huntington? Both owned by the same company. Why would you leave them out of the equation?” James asked.","In November 2023, Rexnord Corp. laid off 300 workers, while Carrier saved 730 jobs, raising concerns from local union president Robert James about the 700 jobs lost in Huntington, both under the same company."

"President Donald Trump is expected to announce this week whether the U.S. will remain committed to the Iran nuclear pact, the abandonment of which could trigger a diplomatic crisis and jolt oil markets. Sources close to the administration cited by the Associated Press predict that Trump will leave the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in place for the time being and waive nuclear sanctions on the Islamic republic as he did on October 13, despite his well-known opposition to the agreement. During his campaign, Trump promised to dump it, calling the it ""the worst deal ever. ""
The JCPOA, enacted in 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany, allowed the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in exchange for compliance with restrictions on its nuclear program. Between January 12 and 17, sanctions on foreign oil purchases, insurance, shipping, banking, and oil and gas investment are due for waiver. Oil markets at risk Any U.S. disruption to the deal could shake oil markets, according to a report by Citigroup's global commodities team published Tuesday. A snap-back on sanctions would cause the ""dislocation of at least 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian crude oil exports, especially those going to Korea and Japan as well as to some European countries. ""

"The U.S. president is required to recertify Iran's compliance to its terms once every 90 days. This time around, Trump is likely to concede that Iran is complying with the deal but that it's not in the U.S.'s national security interest, said Richard Nephew, a former coordinator for sanctions policy at the U.S. State Department and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute. Congress then has a following 60 days to either re-impose sanctions on Iran or do nothing. Non-nuclear sanctions ""The only real outstanding question is what Donald Trump thinks and will choose to do. Contacts within his administration ... have reported that the decision is effectively a 'coin flip' now,"" Nephew wrote in a commentary for Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy on Tuesday.

However, he noted, the U.S. is only one of six international signatories to the deal.","The U.S. president must recertify Iran's compliance every 90 days, with Congress having 60 days to act afterward.

"""Lawmakers can amend the domestic legislation but cannot change the deal itself without the backing of other parties, which is unlikely to materialize. ""
New sanctions would likely be aimed both at Iran's missile program and its activities in the region, despite opposition from other deal signatories, the Citi report said. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Shia militant group Hezbollah, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, are the predominant targets. ""The not-so-subtle threat is one that could materialize in a worst case scenario, which could see Iran use Trump's decision as justification to pull out of the agreement and restart its nuclear program."" -Ryan Turner, lead risk analyst at Protection Group International ""Although too small to directly impact the economy, [the sanctions] will serve to further damage much needed investor sentiment towards Iran,"" Pat Thaker, regional director for the Middle East and Africa at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC Thursday. Iran remains mired in deficit, and while the country's economy grew more than 7 percent in the year following the JCPOA's enactment, foreign investment flows are far from reaching government targets. Thaker expects the state to bunker down and financial sector reform ""to go into reverse"" in the event of an abrogation of the deal. Still, she said, ""I expect the nuclear deal to largely remain intact, with the U.S. instead focusing on increasing non-nuclear sanctions. ""

Analysts expect the nuclear deal to stay intact, with a focus on non-nuclear sanctions."

"January 4, 2018 / 10:22 AM / in an hour Blizzard wallops U.S. Northeast, knocks out power, snarls travel Scott Malone , Jonathan Allen 5 Min Read 
BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A powerful blizzard battered the Northeast on Thursday, knocking out power for tens of thousands of people and snarling travel amid a long cold snap that has gripped much of the United States for more than a week and killed more than a dozen people. Thousands of flights were canceled, firefighters scrambled to rescue motorists from flooded streets in Boston, snow plows and salt trucks rumbled along roads and highways, and New York City’s two main airports halted flights due to whiteout conditions. Commuters who braved the storm worried that they could be stranded later in the day. “I don’t know where I’ll stay tonight if I get stuck, probably with my boss,” said Ran Richardson, 55, of Malden, Massachusetts, as he waited for a Boston subway to take him to training for his job as a Chinese-English translator. Schools were closed through much of the region, and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said schools in his city would remain closed on Friday. Blizzard warnings were in effect along the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine. The National Weather Service forecast winds up to 70 miles per hour (113 km per hour), which downed power lines. Almost 80,000 homes and businesses in the Northeast and Southeast, where the storm struck on Wednesday, were without power. Up to 18 inches (46 cm) of snow was forecast for Boston and coastal areas of northern New England.","On January 4, 2018, a powerful blizzard struck the U.S. Northeast, causing over 80,000 power outages and canceling thousands of flights.

Schools closed across the region, with blizzard warnings issued from North Carolina to Maine."
"Officials feared fast-dropping temperatures after the storm passed would turn remaining snow on roadways to ice. The storm was powered by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters were referring to as bombogenesis or a “bomb cyclone” and which brought high winds and swift, heavy snowfall. The wintry weather has been blamed for at least 14 deaths in the past few days, including four fatalities in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas due to cold.

At those airports, the metropolitan area’s third major airport in Newark, New Jersey, and Boston’s Logan International Airport, as many as three out of four flights were called off, according to tracking service FlightAware.com.

The flooding tied a 40-year record, the National Weather Service said. “It’s dangerous,” Walsh said, adding that Boston officials briefly thought they would need to a evacuate a shelter near the flooded areas. “We’re keeping an eye on all those different floodings.”","Joseph Schwieterman highlighted the challenges of storm damage, noting that replacement parts are hard to find.

"ADEN (Reuters) - Yemen’s internationally-recognized government said on Saturday it had banned public gatherings in Aden ahead of a deadline given by southern separatists to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to dismiss the cabinet.
Tensions have risen in the southern port city since the United Arab Emirates-allied Southern Transitional Council vowed to overthrow the government of Ahmed bin Daghr unless Hadi dismissed his cabinet within a week.
The Southern Transitional Council has accused bin Daghr’s government of starving Yemenis and pushing the impoverished country to the verge of famine.
The crisis could jeopardize a rare opportunity offered by the death of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh last month that had given a Saudi-led coalition the chance to isolate Iran-aligned Houthi fighters and end a devastating war that began in 2015.
In a statement carried by the state-run Saba news agency, the Yemeni Interior Ministry said it had ”decided to ban any gatherings, sit-ins or marches in the interim capital, Aden.
“These actions will be considered acts that target stability and calm,” the statement said, adding that all armed groups will also be banned from entering Aden.
Trying to head off any protests, Bin Daghr’s office said the prime minister met with senior commanders of the Saudi-led coalition in Aden.
“The meeting expressed its utter opposition to any call for chaos, violence or vandalism in the interim capital, Aden,” bin Daghr’s office said in a statement.
GATHERING EXPECTED ON SUNDAY Residents said they had not seen any extra security in Aden, where armed forces loyal to Hadi’s government, the Southern Transitional Council and the Saudi-led coalition are all present.
But witnesses said government forces were deployed on roads leading to the presidential palace in Aden’s al-Maasheeq district, where the government is based.
Witnesses also said that thousands of people had arrived in Aden from across the former South Yemen, which merged with North Yemen in 1990, to participate in a gathering expected to be held on Sunday.
Yemen has been torn by armed conflict since the Houthis captured the capital Sanaa in 2014 before they marched south towards Aden the following year in a military campaign that culminated in Hadi fleeing into exile.
The Saudi-led coalition that entered the war after Hadi sought refuge in Saudi Arabia in March 2015 has helped local fighters free Aden from Houthi control and made other military gains in different parts of the country. But the Houthis continue to control most of northern Yemen, including Sanaa.
The Southern Transitional Council was formed last year to push for a split between the former South Yemen and North Yemen.
Southern forces have previously clashed with Hadi supporters, including members of the Islamist Islah party, over control of strategic areas, such as Aden airport and oil facilities.

"January 25, 2018 / 2:12 PM / Updated an hour ago EU ministers clash again over reforming asylum system Reuters Staff 3 Min Read 
SOFIA (Reuters) - European Union interior ministers grappled on Thursday with the politically charged issue of reforming the bloc’s broken asylum system, which the bloc wants to fix by June. 
For more than two years ex-communist states led by Poland and Hungary have defied pressure from other EU capitals to accept refugees at times of high immigration across the Mediterranean to help ease the burden on frontline states such as Greece and wealthy destination nations such as Germany. 
Poland, Hungary and others are reluctant to take in more refugees, who are mostly from Muslim nations in the Middle East and northern Africa, under a quota system. Germany and others say it is a question of EU solidarity. 
“We cannot leave it all to the countries at the external borders (of the EU),” Luxembourg’s Jean Asselborn said ahead of talks with other interior ministers in Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, which holds the EU’s rotating six-month presidency. 
“We need relocation in times of crisis... so every country knows which burdens it will take on,” he said of plans to oblige each EU state to host a certain number of people when arrivals jump. “If we do not manage this, we will choke on it.” 
The EU asylum system collapsed in 2015 as a million refugees and migrants arrived across the sea, overwhelming Greece and Italy. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic refused to take some of the people in.

Agencja Gazeta/Slawomir Kaminski/via REUTERS 
The dispute ended up in the courts and weakened the bloc’s unity, spilling over to many other policy areas. 
“The quota is not a good thing. But we still have other solutions,” said Slovak Interior Minister Robert Kalinak, referring to a proposal by the eastern states to contribute money, experts and equipment instead of accepting people. 
The EU has given itself until June to find a compromise acceptable to all, though there are no signs yet of progress. 
The bloc could then defeat the reluctant easterners in a majority vote, but this would cause even more bad blood between EU states. 
The EU’s migration chief, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said the “stalemate” had much to do with populist politicians stoking up immigration fears among voters. 
“It’s a question of how you think politically addressing... your domestic audience,” he said on entering the talks. Reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova in Sofia, Gabriela Baczynska, Robert-Jan Bartunek and Peter Maushagen in Brussels, Writing by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Gareth Jones","On January 25, 2018, EU interior ministers met in Sofia to address the contentious reform of the asylum system, aiming for a resolution by June.

Germany and other nations advocate for EU solidarity, while Luxembourg’s Jean Asselborn emphasized the need for burden-sharing during crises. The EU's migration chief, Dimitris Avramopoulos, noted that populist politicians exacerbate immigration fears, complicating negotiations. The potential for a majority vote to bypass reluctant states could further strain EU unity, with no significant progress reported as of the meeting."

"In wake of Attorney General Jeff Sessions ' repeal of Obama era guidance on legal marijuana, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock is more worried about the marijuana business than he is about a law enforcement crackdown on weed.
""When we see an industry, that is dependent upon investors, people who are putting their hard-earned money into the industry, this sort of move does not help whatsoever,"" Hancock, a Democrat, said Friday on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""All this move does is demonstrate how out of step the attorney general sessions is and the administration is with the rest of the country.""
Sessions, a longtime opponent of marijuana legalization, on Thursday moved to rescind the Cole Memo, a document which de-prioritized the use of federal funds to enforce cannabis prohibition. The memo effectively handed control of marijuana enforcement and regulation to the states, except in certain circumstances.
Sessions' decision sent pot stocks tumbling Thursday , fueling fears it would damage burgeoning marijuana industries in many states.
""We've already had conversations with our attorney general, as well as our acting U.S. attorney, who clearly have said they're not going to change anything with regards to the industry here in Colorado,"" Hanckock said.
Colorado, where recreational cannabis has been legal since 2012 and medical for much longer , has a lot more to lose than some states. In 2016, the state topped $1 billion in legal weed revenues , allowing the government to bring in more than $193 million in fees and tax revenues, according to Department of Revenue data.
Hancock said Denver reaps about $18 million to $20 million in tax revenue just from recreational marijuana. That money goes toward implementing marijuana regulation, including inspections, law enforcement and public education, all of which Hancock worries might disappear following Sessions' decision.
""Cities also fall into this uncertain category, when you have the attorney general acting as irresponsible as he has acted with regards to the memo,"" Hancock said.
Investment and taxes aside, the ground-level industry is very cash heavy. Even with the Cole Memo, banks and credit unions operating under federal charters had little incentive to help cannabis businesses, which are still federally illegal, according to a representative from the Colorado Bankers Association. 
""W hat we would hope our attorney general would do to work with Congress, begin the process of working on a pathway to banking for this industry,"" Hancock said.
Hancock is part of a growing chorus of prominent voices against Sessions' decision. On Thursday, Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner vowed to hold up Justice Department nominations until Sessions changes his marijuana policy .","Following Attorney General Jeff Sessions' repeal of the Cole Memo, which previously de-prioritized federal enforcement of marijuana laws, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock expressed concern for the marijuana industry rather than a law enforcement crackdown.

Denver alone collects $18 million to $20 million from recreational marijuana taxes. Hancock emphasized the need for a banking solution for the cash-heavy industry and noted that local officials have assured no immediate changes in Colorado's marijuana regulation."

"January 15, 2018 / 9:08 AM / Updated 4 hours ago Leader of Britain's UKIP splits with girlfriend after 'appalling' Markle comments Michael Holden 3   The leader of Britain’s anti-European Union UKIP Party said he had split with his new girlfriend after a newspaper published derogatory comments she made about Prince Harry’s fiancee Meghan Markle and black people. FILE PHOTO - Meghan Markle visits radio station Reprezent FM, with her fiancee Britain's Prince Harry, in Brixton, London January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Dominic Lipinski/Pool 
Henry Bolton, 54, who became the ailing UK Independence Party’s fourth leader in a year when he was elected last September, said he had ended his relationship with model Jo Marney after the “appalling” text messages she sent to a friend were published. 
Marney, 25, who began dating Bolton just after Christmas, had described U.S. actress Markle, whose father is white and mother is African-American, as a “dumb little commoner” and said “her seed with (sic) taint our royal family”, according to the texts printed in the Mail on Sunday newspaper. 
Marney also described black people as ugly. 
“The romantic element of the relationship is over,” Bolton told BBC radio, saying they had split up on Sunday night. 
“However appalling and insulting those comments she made in those direct personal messages were ... I honestly don’t believe those are her core beliefs.” 
Harry said Markle had been subjected to “outright sexism and racism” on social media when he revealed they were first dating in 2016 and that there had also been racial undertones in newspaper comment pieces. The couple announced in November that they were engaged and will marry in May. 
Led by the charismatic Nigel Farage, UKIP won nearly four million votes in 2015, 12.6 percent of those cast, on its anti-EU platform, projecting it to the forefront of British politics even though it only managed to win one seat in parliament. 
Its success helped force former Conservative prime minister David Cameron, who once dismissed the party as being full of “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists”, to agree to hold the 2016 referendum on whether to leave the EU and played a role in encouraging Britons to vote for Brexit. 
But UKIP has been riven by internal strife since the referendum as it struggles for direction and a clear purpose and it won just 1.8 percent of the total votes cast in a national election last June. 
Marney was suspended from UKIP after the texts became public on Sunday and senior party figures called for Bolton, a former army infantry officer who also served in the police, to step down himself. 
“People have been able to use Jo in order to attack me,” he said. “I have no intention of resigning and indeed the people who have been calling for my resignation are people who for some time have been trying to work to undermine the leadership of the party in any case.” 
He said there had not been a “cold parting of the ways” but his job had to take priority. 
“She is utterly devastated. I‘m not defending the comments she made, she’s not defending the comments she made,” he said. “Jo is incredibly upset as am I, I‘m going to stand by her and the family in terms of trying to put her life back together.” Editing by William Maclean","On January 15, 2018, Henry Bolton, 54, leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), announced his split from girlfriend Jo Marney, 25, after derogatory comments she made about Meghan Markle and black people were published.

"January 10, 2018 / 10:48 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago Real Madrid stumble against Numancia but reach Cup quarters Rik Sharma 2 Min Read 
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Troubled Spanish champions Real Madrid stumbled to a 2-2 draw with third tier Numancia on Wednesday but qualified for the King’s Cup quarter-finals 5-2 on aggregate. 
With a comfortable first-leg advantage, Zinedine Zidane rested much of his first team, making 10 changes from the line-up that struggled to a disappointing draw at Celta Vigo on Sunday to fall 16 points behind league leaders Barcelona. 
Madrid opened the scoring in the 11th minute, Vazquez heading home Dani Carvajal’s deep cross when left unmarked at the back post. 
Numancia hit back in the 45th minute, however, with substitute Guillermo, just on for the injured Higinio Marin, applying the finishing touch to a stunning breakaway goal. 
Dani Nieto charged into space and fed Marc Mateu on the left, who delivered the perfect low cross for Guillermo to finish and delight the small band of travelling fans at the Santiago Bernabeu. 
Vazquez, who won two penalties for Madrid in the first leg, slammed home his second from close range in the 59th minute, but Guillermo pegged back Madrid again with a brilliant header to cap a superb display and a fine result for his team. 
Numancia’s Dani Calvo was sent off in the dying minutes for a cynical foul to stop Isco that earned him a second yellow card. 
Earlier, Leganes reached the quarter-finals for the first time in their history after losing 2-1 at Villarreal but progressing on away goals after their 1-0 first-leg win at Butarque. 
Leganes winger Nabil El Zhar scored a delicious chip to break the deadlock, with Dani Raba’s well-taken strike and Denis Cheryshev’s late winner completing a Villarreal comeback that was not enough to send the hosts through. 
Last season’s King’s Cup runners-up Alaves beat third division Fomentera 2-0 to wrap up a 5-1 aggregate win thanks to second-half goals from Ermedin Demirovic and Alfonso Pedraza.

"January 29, 2018 / 10:58 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago Malaysian court says both parents must consent on children's religion Reuters Staff 4 Min Read 
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Monday said the religion of a minor could only be decided with consent from both parents, a landmark ruling ending a near decade-old case that widened religious and racial divisions. 
The judgement is seen as a victory for ethnic and religious minorities in the Muslim-majority nation who are pushing for greater recognition of their rights, amid what critics see as growing Islamic conservatism in its government. 
Five judges of Malaysia’s Federal Court said it was unconstitutional for just one parent to convert a minor to their religion. 
“Both parents have equal rights,” the Star Online news site quoted one of the judges, Zainun Ali, as saying. 
“The word ‘parent’ - is a case of being lost in translation,” she added, referring to a Malaysian constitutional provision. 
The decision upholds a lower court ruling in favour of Indira Gandhi - who challenged the conversion of her three children by her Muslim-convert former husband in 2009. 
The conversion of her three children was null and void, the judges added. 
Until now, the unilateral conversion of minors by Muslim converts had left women with little recourse, as their complaints would be referred to a sharia religious court, where non-Muslims have no standing to make claims. 
“It’s a great victory for many, because finally these unilateral conversions will stop,” said Kulasegaran Murugeson, Indira’s lead lawyer. 
Muslims make up about 60 percent of a population of about 30 million, although Buddhists, Christians and Hindus account for a significant minority. 
The ruling leaves police with the responsibility to locate and return Indira’s youngest daughter, taken away by her ex-husband, Muhammad Riduan Abdullah, in 2009, when she was 11 months old, Kulasegaran said. 
Muhammad Riduan has yet to return the child and is believed to have gone into hiding, despite a 2010 high court order that awarded Indira custody of all three children. 
However, police have not acted on that order until now, because of a conflict in the jurisdiction of civil and sharia courts. 
“The police must go aggressively (to retrieve the child),” 
Kulasegaran said. “Locating Muhammad Riduan is not impossible, and any extra day that goes by will only add to the pain of Indira and her family.” 
The police will now obey the court order to track down Muhammad Riduan and the girl, media quoted the inspector-general of police, Mohamad Fuzi Harun, as saying. 
The verdict was a “huge victory for all Malaysians” and for women like Indira who have faced “grave violations” of their rights, said Malaysian rights group the Women’s Aid Organisation. 
The opposition and civil society groups have criticised Prime Minister Najib Razak’s administration for taking a more conservative tack, such as backing a bill to widen sharia courts’ jurisdiction over Muslims in northern Kelantan state. 
The government also faced criticism for dropping, as being unconstitutional, a family law change that would have brought cases of unilateral conversion within the purview of civil law. Reporting by Joseph Sipalan; Editing by Clarence Fernandez","On January 29, 2018, Malaysia's Federal Court ruled that both parents must consent to the religion of a minor, marking a significant legal victory for ethnic and religious minorities in the predominantly Muslim nation, where Muslims comprise about 60% of the 30 million population.

The court declared the conversions null and void, emphasizing that both parents have equal rights. This decision also mandates police to locate Indira's youngest daughter, taken by her ex-husband, who has been in hiding since 2009.

"January 2, 2018 / 3:07 AM / Updated 8 hours ago German parties at odds ahead of coalition talks Andrea Shalal 5 Min Read 
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) traded barbs about migration and tax cuts on Tuesday amid mounting questions about whether they can agree to renew the “grand coalition” that ruled Germany for the past four years. 
Merkel, under pressure after failing to form a government three months after national elections, hopes to secure a fourth term in office by persuading the center-left SPD to join the government despite punishing losses in September’s election. 
Party leaders will meet for preliminary talks on Jan. 3 ahead of exploratory talks scheduled for Jan. 7 through Jan. 12, but a growing number of politicians now say Merkel might have to rule with a minority government, or face new elections. 
SPD deputy leader Thorsten Schaefer-Guembel said recent comments by some conservatives were “counterproductive for every form of government formation” and said they had sparked doubts about the will of conservatives to govern together. 
He said a deal on a new coalition was far from certain and it was unclear if the talks could develop sufficient trust. 
“A minority government remains an option, even if Chancellor Angela Merkel doesn’t want to acknowledge that,” he said in an interview published Tuesday in the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper. 
Schaefer-Guembel cited differences with conservatives on a range of issues and rejected as “absurd” proposals by some conservatives to cut taxes for high-income earners. 
Conservatives and the SPD are also at odds over healthcare, immigration, Europe, work regulations and pensions. 
Schaefer-Guembel said he backed calls by SPD parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles to raise taxes for the wealthiest and urge fresh efforts to prevent big companies from evading taxes. 
Merkel’s Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has distanced itself from the SPD through policy papers calling for corporate tax cuts, reductions in benefits for asylum seekers, higher military spending and limits on immigration. 
The powerful economic council of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) said it will urge CSU party leaders to push for a minority government when they meet this week, arguing that Germany would face “enormous financial burdens for generations” if the SPD pushed through its spending plans in a coalition. 
“A grand coalition will be more expensive in the long term than a minority government,” Wolfgang Steiger, secretary general of the council told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper. 
The SPD initially wanted to stay in opposition, but agreed to explore the possibility of governing with the conservatives in the interest of political stability after Merkel’s coalition talks with two smaller parties collapsed in November. 
Experts say new elections could hand more gains to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that entered parliament for the first time in September. Merkel says a new coalition would be more stable than minority government. 
Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, a CSU negotiator, told the Funke media group his party would insist on limiting immigration levels. It wanted to extend a temporary ban on family reunifications for migrants who were granted “subsidiary protection”, an asylum status for those not officially classed as refugees. 
He said his party viewed it as a democratic responsibility to negotiate a new coalition if policy gaps could be overcome. 
“I hope the Social Democrats feel the same sense of responsibility,” he said. “We have an urgent need for action on the legislative front.... We urgently need clear majorities in parliament, we need reliable coalitions.” 
A top member of the pro-business Free Democrats, which dropped out of coalition talks with conservatives and Greens in November, said such a coalition remained a future possibility. 
Alexander Lambsdorff, deputy leader of the FDP’s parliamentary group, also told the Heilbronner Stimme newspaper that he did not exclude the possibility of new elections or a minority government. “That would not be nice, but it also would not result in a constitutional crisis,” he said. Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Peter Graff","As of January 2, 2018, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) are struggling to form a coalition government after the September elections, where Merkel's party faced significant losses. Preliminary talks are set for January 3, with exploratory discussions scheduled from January 7 to 12. The SPD's deputy leader, Thorsten Schaefer-Guembel, expressed skepticism about the coalition's viability, citing disagreements on migration, tax cuts, healthcare, and pensions. He emphasized the possibility of a minority government, which Merkel opposes. The SPD initially preferred to remain in opposition but is reconsidering for political stability. The Bavarian CSU party is advocating for corporate tax cuts and stricter immigration policies. Experts warn that new elections could benefit the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which gained seats in September. The Christian Democrats' economic council argues that a grand coalition would incur greater long-term costs than a minority government."

Benn’s goal chased Lehner, and Johnson was greeted with a goal by Lindell less than three minutes later. Alexander Radulov and Benn got the assists on the score.

"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumer prices remained subdued last quarter as core inflation ended a second whole year below the central bank’s target, leading investors to widen the odds on a hike in interest rates anytime soon.
The local dollar fell a quarter of a U.S. cent as the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.6 percent in the December quarter, missing forecasts for a 0.7 percent rise.
Annual CPI inflation ran at 1.9 percent, again under estimates. Key measures of underlying inflation favored by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) averaged around 1.9 percent for the year, dead on expectations.
Core inflation has now undershot the RBA’s long-term target band of 2 percent to 3 percent for eight straight quarters, the longest period on record.
A major headwind has been wages growth, which slowed to historic lows even as employment boomed, a phenomenon shared with much of the developed world.
“Global competition, increased automation, decreased unionization, reduced collective bargaining and the increased casualisation of the workforce have largely contained pay increases,” said Ryan Felsman, a senior economist at CommSec.
“There is increasing uncertainty about the size and timing of how wage pressures might eventually pass through to prices.”
As a result, the central bank has kept interest rates at an all-time low of 1.5 percent since mid-2016, and appears in no hurry to raise them.
Investors assumed the benign inflation result would only add to the patience of policy makers and pushed out the likely timing of a first hike.
Interest rate futures imply around a 50-50 chance of a move by August. A hike to 1.75 percent is now not fully priced in until December, compared to November before the data.
THE AMAZON EFFECT The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the main price increases in the fourth quarter were petrol, which jumped more than 10 percent, domestic holidays, fruit and tobacco.
Tobacco is a serial offender due to steep annual increases in taxes. Excluding that rise, inflation ran at only 1.5 percent for the year.
The main price falls in the quarter were for traveling abroad, telecoms and computers and televisions.
A fierce price war has broken out in Australian retail in recent years driven by an influx of foreign chains, with no sign of a cease-fire any time soon.
If anything, the struggle is only heating up as online behemoth Amazon launched late last year vowing to beat all the competition - a disinflationary trend that policymakers now refer to as the “Amazon effect”.
Adding to downside pressure will be strength in the local dollar, which climbed from as low as $0.7500 in early December to reach a 2-1/2-year peak of $0.8136 last week.
If sustained, the rise will lower prices for many imported goods that have already been depressed by globalization and the ascent of industrial giants such as China.
Prices for such tradable goods and services edged up 0.5 percent in the December quarter, but were still down 0.3 percent for the year.

"January 10, 2018 / 7:12 AM / Updated an hour ago Tennis: Sabalenka upsets Zhang in Hobart, Watson advances Reuters Staff 2 Min Read 
(Reuters) - Belarus teen Aryna Sabalenka blasted top seed Zhang Shuai out of the Hobart International on Wednesday while former champion Heather Watson had a smooth ride to the quarter-finals with a 6-2 6-2 win over wildcard Jaimee Fourlis. 
Big-hitting Sabalenka had felled former world number five Eugenie Bouchard in the first round and the Belarusian’s aggressive strategy paid dividends again as she triumphed 7-6(3) 6-4. 
“It was a really good fight between us,” Sabalenka told reporters after firing 37 winners and committing 39 unforced errors. 
“This was a match that I really enjoyed. She fights for every point, and it’s always so special when you feel this fight on court.” 
Broken early, Sabalenka won four games in a row en route to a 5-2 lead in the first set when Zhang staged a comeback to level it at 5-5 before the Belarusian clinched the set. 
Sabalenka was more in control in the second set when she claimed a decisive break at 4-3 before serving out to set up a quarter-final clash with fifth seed Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine. 
“It’s always special when you beat two good players in a row in the same tournament,” Sabalenka said. 
“It gives me more confidence. You finish the match and you really just think, ‘When is the next one? I want to go back on court, I want to beat someone.'” 
Briton Watson had little difficulty in beating Australian Fourlis, a victory which moves the 2015 champion into a quarter-final against Donna Vekic, and Alison Riske also advanced after Belgian qualifier Kirsten Flipkens pulled out with a right shoulder injury.

"SYDNEY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Sweltering weather across southern Australia sparked power price spikes on Friday and prompted the national grid operator to put emergency generators on standby.
Temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104°F) represent the first major test of the energy grid this year after nearly 2,000 megawatts of extra capacity were added to prevent blackouts that have previously hit household and industrial users.
The extra capacity includes the world’s biggest lithium ion battery built by Tesla Inc, which was switched on last month and provides 120 megawatts.
Scorching conditions stretch the grid as people crank up power-hungry air conditioners, while the heat reduces the capacity of transmission wires to carry electricity.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which runs the national electricity market, expected a decline in reserves in the states of Victoria and South Australia on Friday afternoon, but no disruption to supply.
It asked generators that feed power into the grid to be on standby to supply extra power in those states.
Forecast wholesale spot power prices for dispatch on Friday afternoon in South Australia and Victoria have spiked to the capped level of A$14,200 ($11,366) per megawatt hour (MWh), AEMO said on its website.
Last summer was the first in eight years to see power failures in Australia’s southeastern states, including outages that forced BHP Billiton to stop production at its Olympic Dam mine for two weeks and Alcoa Corp to shut one of two potlines at its Portland aluminium smelter.
Alcoa, one of the biggest electricity users in Victoria, is one of several industrial customers asked by AEMO to go on standby to reduce electricity demand if necessary on Friday afternoon.
“If managed appropriately Portland smelter can be safely curtailed for short time periods (up to one hour) to provide much needed capacity during peak demand periods,” Alcoa said in a statement.
A spokeswoman for Nyrstar, operator of the world’s biggest lead refinery at Port Pirie in South Australia said it was running as usual.
BHP declined to comment on whether its operations could be impacted.

For many people, going to work is simply a way to make a living, unhappily trudging through each day to make ends meet. But happiness expert and bestselling author Annie McKee wants people to escape this harmful cycle. 
""If you have adopted that mindset that says, 'Work is grueling, just be happy you have a job, that you're getting a paycheck, it's a good company,' but you're not actually happy, you don't have to accept that,"" McKee tells CNBC Make It . 
""Everyone deserves to be happy at work because if we're not happy at work, we're not happy in life,"" she adds. show chapters 11:05 AM ET Fri, 15 Dec 2017 | 01:04 
As a leadership adviser for Fortune 500 companies and governments around the world, McKee has spent decades researching effectiveness and happiness at work. She details portions of this research in her latest book: "" How to Be Happy at Work: The Power of Purpose, Hope, and Friendship ."" 
""There are three ways to tell if things are not well,"" McKee says. ""There are physical clues that tell us something is wrong, emotional clues based on how we feel on a daily basis over time and clues from the health of our relationships."" 
If you have seen your unhappiness at work taking a toll on other areas of your life, such as your sleeping patterns, nutrition or family relationships, McKee recommends that you follow these two steps to regain a sense of purpose and happiness. Step one: Reflect 
Once you understand you aren't happy at work, the first thing McKee recommends that you do is carve out some time for deep reflection and introspection. Ask yourself, ""What is causing me to feel sad or unhappy at work?"" 
""It's far too easy to habitually tell yourself, 'I'm sad because don't like my manager' or 'I'm sad because didn't get promotion'"" McKee says. ""And while those things might be true, there's almost always something deeper than that."" show chapters 1:00 PM ET Tue, 20 Dec 2016 | 01:25 
McKee further recommends that you be honest with yourself and ask if there is something about your own mindset and life that may be contributing to your unhappiness at work. 
""Have you gotten trapped by overwork? Has your ambition gotten out of control? Have you chosen jobs and work projects because you think you should or because you actually want to?"" McKee says. ""Don't get caught in these traps."" Step two: Find a friend 
Whether it's at work or outside of work, McKee suggests finding a friend to discuss this state of being with. 
""Find someone who you can really talk with, who can really tell you the truth about what they see in you, whether it's the strengths or some developmental areas they see in you,"" McKee says. show chapters 12:22 PM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 | 00:59 
Your friend can help you decide if you seem to fit in with your current workplace or if the job is not the right fit for you. 
""Talking with a friend as if they were your [career] coach could also help you see your attitude about work from a different perspective,"" McKee says. ""And be open to all possibilities. Maybe you need to change your mindset, maybe you need to change what you do on a daily basis"" 
""We have a lot more freedom than we like to think we do,"" she adds.","Annie McKee, a happiness expert and bestselling author, emphasizes the importance of finding joy at work, stating that everyone deserves happiness in their professional lives. With decades of experience advising Fortune 500 companies, she outlines three indicators of workplace unhappiness: physical signs, emotional feelings over time, and the health of relationships. McKee suggests two steps to regain purpose: first, reflect on the deeper causes of unhappiness beyond surface issues like management or promotions; second, find a friend to discuss feelings and gain perspective. She encourages individuals to consider their mindset and choices, asserting that people often have more freedom to change their situations than they realize. McKee's insights are detailed in her book, ""How to Be Happy at Work: The Power of Purpose, Hope, and Friendship."""
"ISRAEL-GAZA BORDER (Reuters) - The worst fighting on the Gaza Strip front since 2014 is being calibrated by Hamas, which wants to signal defiance of Israel and the United States while being careful not to trigger a new war for the enclave’s penned-in Palestinians. Since President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Dec. 6 by recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, Palestinians in Gaza have launched 18 cross-border rockets or mortars - a third of all such attacks in 3-1/2 years of relative quiet. For Israel’s part, though residents in the south have raised a clamour for harsh retaliation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has counselled caution and targeted mostly unmanned Hamas facilities in night-time airstrikes. The careful moves reflect the balancing act maintained both by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, and the Israeli government, old foes who share a reluctance to go to war again. Gaza’s neighbourhoods still bear the scars of the destruction caused by Israeli attacks during a seven-week conflict in 2014. In Israel, there is little eagerness to endure the daily sirens warning of rocket strikes. But ordinary Israelis and Palestinians are keenly aware that even a single incident - a rocket causing multiple fatalities in Israel or Israeli forces killing a militant leader - could set off a conflagration that would be beyond their leaders’ control. Two Hamas gunmen have died in retaliatory Israeli air strikes and 15 protesters from Israeli gunfire. “The recent weeks of rockets and Israeli bombardment proved an explosion is possible,” said Gaza political analyst Akram Attalla.","Since December 6, 2017, when the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Palestinians in Gaza have launched 18 cross-border attacks, a third of total incidents in 3.5 years of relative calm. The 2014 conflict's scars remain, with 2 Hamas gunmen and 15 protesters killed recently. Both Hamas and Israel show reluctance to escalate, fearing a larger war could erupt from a single incident."
"“How long will Hamas continue to take Israeli strikes to its positions without a response? And how long will Israel’s Netanyahu tolerate internal criticism? There is no guarantee.” While there have been no Israeli fatalities or serious injuries in the rocket strikes, farmers in communities close to the Gazan border think twice about tilling fields where they might be exposed and children practice duck-and-cover drills should air raid sirens sound. “Lately we do feel that there is more presence of the army. We have been told to be more careful, to clear the bomb shelter just in case. You never know when the next rocket will come,” said Hila Fenlon, resident of the farm collective Nativ Haasara. Hamas has responded to Trump’s move by mobilising mass protests at the border and turning a blind eye to other factions firing into Israel in two weeks of daily attacks, which have tailed off recently. “This saves face for Hamas, as it appears to be the one that stands behind these protests without the need to go to war,” said Attalla. A more violent response was tamped down in debate among Palestinian factions who agreed that an armed confrontation could erode the international support Palestinians have won diplomatically and shift attention from the political process.","Israeli farmers near the Gazan border are cautious due to ongoing rocket strikes, with no fatalities reported. Children practice drills, and military presence has increased. Hamas has organized protests while avoiding direct conflict, as factions debate the risks of armed confrontation, fearing loss of international support."
"Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said no-one should underestimate the potential for hostilities to resume under what he called an Israeli occupation, however. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the territory in 2005 but remains the conduit for the passage of goods and supplies most of its electricity. Israel and Egypt, citing security concerns, maintain tight restrictions on the passage of Palestinians through their borders with the enclave. FILE PHOTO: A sign displays distances to various cities and sites in Israel and the Gaza Strip, positioned in an observation point in Nativ Haasara, close to the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, Israel January 8, 2018. REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File Photo “The situation in Gaza is very difficult and is not tolerable and is doomed to explode,” he told Reuters. IRANIAN SUPPORT Israel sees an outside catalyst for the violence - Iran, which both Hamas and its sometime ally Islamic Jihad say has pledged unlimited assistance for them as the Syrian civil war, where Tehran deployed reinforcements for Damascus, winds down. Israel has gone out its way to blame Islamic Jihad and other groups for the rocket and mortar attacks, rather than Hamas, and even gave grudging credit to Hamas for being mindful of Palestinian civilian needs. “Calls to respond with full force against Hamas are irresponsible,” the top Israeli general, Gadi Eizenkot, said in a speech last week. He noted Gaza’s “danger of humanitarian collapse”, which, he said, had forced Hamas to engage with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and secured a renewed power supply to the enclave.","Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri warned of potential hostilities resuming under Israeli occupation, despite Israel's 2005 troop withdrawal. Israel and Egypt enforce strict border controls, impacting Palestinian movement. Iran reportedly provides unlimited support to Hamas and Islamic Jihad amid the Syrian civil war. Israeli General Gadi Eizenkot highlighted Gaza's humanitarian crisis, prompting Hamas to engage with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for renewed power supply."
"Slideshow (3 Images) Israel also has problems elsewhere. Having neutralised much of the rocket threat from Gaza with their Iron Dome interceptor system, and hard at a work on an underground wall that would block guerrilla tunnels from the territory, Israeli defence officials say they worry more about Iran and the combustible northern front with Syria and Lebanon. They also fear that the $1.1 billion sensor-equipped barrier on the 60-km (37-mile) frontier could tempt Gaza militants to use their tunnels to strike Israel before they lose them. A range of economic initiatives have been broached, from the construction of an island off Gaza to handle direct imports by sea to the issuing of more permits for Palestinian labourers or agricultural exports to enter Israel. “There is an effort to help the (Palestinian) population in a way that will not go to the armed wing of Hamas,” said Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli military intelligence chief and head of Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies, which has prepared a 180-page memorandum on the Gaza crisis. Israeli concern about worsening Gaza’s internal problems has put it at odds even with the Trump administration, which has threatened to cut U.S. contributions to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that provides essential aid for Palestinian refugees in the enclave, supporting and administering hundreds of schools and dozens of health facilities. Israel says funds should be cut gradually and UNRWA should ultimately be dismantled and its responsibilities transferred to the United Nations’ global refugee agency. Cutting aid to UNRWA would spell “huge pressures on Gaza’s residents,” said Saleh Naami, another Palestinian political analyst. Peter Lerner, a former Israeli military spokesman, agreed. “While UNRWA is far from perfect, the Israeli defence establishment, and the Israeli government as a whole, have over the years come to the understanding that all alternatives are worse for Israel,” he said.","Israel is focused on multiple security challenges, particularly concerning Iran and the northern front with Syria and Lebanon, despite neutralizing much of the rocket threat from Gaza with the Iron Dome. They are constructing a $1.1 billion, 60-km (37-mile) sensor-equipped barrier to deter tunnel attacks. Economic initiatives include a proposed island off Gaza for direct imports and increased permits for Palestinian laborers. A 180-page memorandum on the Gaza crisis highlights concerns over U.S. aid cuts to UNRWA, which supports hundreds of schools and health facilities."

"January 24, 2018 / 1:43 PM / in 8 hours A Canadian hockey brat drives the women's game in Korea Dan Burns 5 Min Read 
NORTH HAVEN, Connecticut (Reuters) - As the daughter of a former NHL coach and a two-time U.S. collegiate champion in her own right, Sarah Murray knows a thing or two about ice hockey and its culture. She knows you “pinch” the boards with your body to keep a puck in the offensive zone. You jump over the boards for a fast line change. And you hang on to your stick and helmet during the national anthem. What is second nature to a Canadian like her, though, has sometimes been a foreign concept to the players she now coaches on the South Korean women’s hockey team. Murray, hired in 2014 by Stanley Cup winner Jim Paek, now the head of South Korean hockey, recalls her first world championship tournament behind the bench when her players dropped their sticks, helmets, even gloves to the ice as the national anthem started - a major taboo in the hockey world. “No one had taught them to do it differently. There’s a lot of pieces of hockey culture that they weren’t taught,” Murray said during a recent pre-Olympic U.S. tour. “The first year was a lot of learning as we go,” Murray said.","Sarah Murray, a Canadian hockey coach and daughter of an NHL coach, has been leading the South Korean women's hockey team since 2014.

"“Now it’s a lot better. The team is very professional.” ON THE UP 
The team is also a lot better at hockey. Under Murray, South Korea has surged six spots to No. 22 in the world rankings. Last year, they won their division’s world title and earned a promotion. When she took over, her main goal was growing the sport in a country that has not taken much to ice hockey, especially not by women and girls. The International Ice Hockey Federation counts just 319 female players in Korea, out of a total fewer than 3000. ”It’s really difficult, the system in Korea,“ Murray said. ”Girls can play youth hockey, but there are no teams once they become teenagers. ”They can practice with the boys teams, but they don’t get to play any games.","Under coach Murray, South Korea's women's hockey team improved six spots to No. 22 globally, winning their division's world title.

"So that’s not any fun. So then they quit. “Unless they make our team.”  The result is a squad with the oldest player, at 30, being roughly twice the age of her youngest teammates, who are 16. “They started with our team when they were 13 because they didn’t have anywhere else to go,” Murray said. ”They were skilled enough that we knew that they had potential. So then we have 13-year-olds and 30-year-olds practicing on the same team.

“It’s really ... interesting.” FROM HOGWARTS TO SEOUL 
Murray grew up in an ice hockey household. Her father Andy Murray is an IIHF Hall of Famer who coached the NHL’s Los Angeles Kings and St. Louis Blues and has had stints behind the bench with Canada, 
She played at Shattuck-St. Mary‘s, a Minnesota prep school broadcaster ESPN once called the “Hogwarts of hockey.” Then she played defense on two national champion teams at the University of Minnesota Duluth. After college she played professionally in Switzerland before deciding to do something with her teaching degree and heading to a school in China. Slideshow (8 Images) 
Even there, hockey was never far away, and she was soon playing in a men’s “beer league” in Beijing. “I realized I had that fire still,” she said. She headed to her father’s in Michigan, training to return to the Swiss pro ranks. While she was there, her father bumped into Paek at a wedding. He had just been named head of South Korean hockey and needed a women’s team coach.","Murray, daughter of IIHF Hall of Famer Andy Murray, played at Shattuck-St. Mary’s and won two national championships at the University of Minnesota Duluth.

"In no time she found herself in an interview at the kitchen table. She did not hear from Paek before returning to Switzerland for the start of her season, so thought she had missed the job before an email appeared. “It was my contract.” The 29-year-old Murray is by far the youngest of the eight head coaches prepping their teams for the Olympics, but her final preparations have been thrown with the International Olympic Committee announcing a unified women’s team with the North would be formed. Murray told Reuters this week that the team had been placed in a “tough situation”, but she would just adapt. The decision came after the team had reset their Olympic goals. Their previous aim was to emerge knowing they had done their utmost and with no regrets. But after some battling performances on a recent U.S. tour, when they won one of their six games, now they have higher ambitions. ”We didn’t talk about who we were going to beat or how many games we’re going to win,“ Murray said. ”We just wanted to advance.","At 29, Murray is the youngest of eight head coaches preparing for the Olympics.

"Bitcoin's price has been on a wild ride since its inception. 2017 alone saw massive gains, starting the year at under $1,000 and, at its peak, breaking $19,000, according to industry site CoinDesk. On Tuesday, it was trading at $11,943 , a decline of 12 percent, according to CoinDesk. As bitcoin's popularity surges and its price rises and falls, more and more people are asking the same question: How does bitcoin , something that's essentially invisible and intangible, have value?
Scarcity and utility In economics, something has value if it checks the following two boxes: scarcity and utility. Scarcity just means that something has a finite supply. In the case of bitcoin, the cryptocurrency has a set cap of 21 million bitcoins. Many analysts note that this set cap makes bitcoin more desirable than other assets, even gold. That's because unlike with gold, there's no need to worry about a digital Gold Rush. A treasure trove of bitcoin won't ever be ""discovered,"" causing the crypto's price to crash with an influx in supply. ""There are potentially millions of times more gold underground than actually has been extracted,"" said Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors.","Bitcoin's price peaked at over $19,000 in 2017, starting the year under $1,000. As of Tuesday, it was trading at $11,943, down 12%. Bitcoin's value stems from its scarcity, with a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it more desirable than gold, which has unlimited potential supply."
"Lee was chief equity strategist at J.P. Morgan before co-founding Fundstrat in 2014. Ben Yu, a blockchain expert living in San Francisco, says technological advances are also making gold easier to mine. ""Today we mine gold at four times the rate that we did just 100 years ago,"" Yu said. So if bitcoin has scarcity, what about its utility? Chesnot | Getty Images Many believe the cryptocurrency's utility lies in its potential to be a more efficient commodity than we already have. Proponents of bitcoin like it for a number of reasons. First, bitcoin is decentralized, meaning no government, bank or single person has control over it; it can't be toppled by corruption at the top. It's also trivially divisible, meaning you can buy a small item like a doughnut with it as easily as you can buy a house or even a mansion. And finally, the code it's built on is open source, meaning that it's available for anyone to look at, scrutinize and even modify. This means bitcoin is constantly evolving and improving.","Lee co-founded Fundstrat in 2014 after serving as J.P. Morgan's chief equity strategist. Ben Yu notes gold is now mined at four times the rate of 100 years ago. Bitcoin's decentralized, divisible, and open-source nature enhances its utility as a commodity."
"None of those uses is intrinsic, however. And that's a point bitcoin skeptics often make. Gold, for example, is thought to have intrinsic value because of its applications in industries like dentistry and electronics. Some people even argue that dollar bills have intrinsic value, since they can be used as kindling or to write on. But as you break down either of those claims, it becomes clear that gold and paper money don't have that much intrinsic value either. According to the World Gold Council, in 2016, only 15 percent of gold was used in industries. The majority went toward making jewelry and gold bars and coins — items that have value mainly because they're trusted to be valuable. With paper money, the Federal Reserve says it costs about 16 cents to create a $100 bill. So the rest of that hundred bucks — the remaining $99.84 — comes from the trust people place in it. It can be hard to see the digital currency as having value because you can't hold it in your hand like you can a dollar bill or gold.","Bitcoin skeptics argue that unlike gold, which had only 15% of its 2016 usage in industries, or paper money, costing 16 cents to produce a $100 bill, digital currency lacks intrinsic value. Both gold and paper money derive value primarily from trust rather than inherent worth."
"As a solution, Lee said to think of bitcoin as a digital business. ""If you ask a baby boomer, 'Can you justify the value of anything that's a digital business?' they probably don't accept that Facebook, Google, Netflix, Amazon, Apple, these are the largest companies in the S&P 500 and they're primarily digital businesses built almost purely on digital trust,"" said Lee. ""Anyone who thinks digital gold isn't a store value is overlooking the fact that most businesses today are built around digital trust, including the financial system. "" Valuing the cryptocurrency It's clear that some people believe bitcoin has value. And if it has value, it's hard not to wonder how much a single bitcoin could end up being worth. There are two main theories being used to calculate the potential value of one bitcoin. The first theorizes that bitcoin, which some perceive to be a better asset than gold, could end up replacing either a portion of gold or gold entirely.","Lee argues that bitcoin, like major digital companies (Facebook, Google, Netflix, Amazon, Apple), is a digital business built on trust. He suggests bitcoin could replace gold, impacting its value significantly, as many view it as a superior asset."
"bodnarchuk | iStock Editorial | Getty Images Bitcoin on a mound of gold. If it were to replace gold entirely, one bitcoin could be worth $357,000. That's calculated by taking the total value of all the gold ever mined in the world, which is about $7.5 trillion, and dividing that number by 21 million — the total bitcoins that can ever exist. Lee told CNBC it's more realistic to assume bitcoin will replace 5 percent of gold within five years, making a single coin worth $25,000. Another theory of Lee's is based on Metcalfe's law, which says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users on the network. For example, one phone is useless because you can't call anyone else with it. But the value increases exponentially as other people get phones. Studies have shown that Metcalfe's law holds true for Facebook using 10 years of data. It also holds true for Tencent, China's largest social media company. Fundstrat looked at users on the bitcoin network and found that the square of this value explained 94 percent of the variation in bitcoin prices since 2014.","If Bitcoin were to replace gold entirely, its value could reach $357,000, based on gold's $7.5 trillion total value divided by 21 million bitcoins. Realistically, Bitcoin may replace 5% of gold in five years, valuing it at $25,000. Metcalfe's law explains 94% of Bitcoin price variations since 2014."
"Many people think that bitcoin is a bubble, and that's predicted on the concept that bitcoin has no value. But there's reason to believe that that just isn't true. By definition, bitcoin is scarce. And the cryptocurrency may have utility as a superior way to store and exchange wealth. WATCH: Bitcoin's creator may be worth $14 billion show chapters Bitcoin’s origin story remains shrouded in mystery. Here's why it matters      6:30 PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 06:23","Bitcoin is often viewed as a bubble, with critics arguing it lacks value. However, its scarcity and potential utility as a superior method for storing and exchanging wealth suggest otherwise. The identity of Bitcoin's creator remains unknown, but their estimated worth is around $14 billion.

"Transaction Creates a Leading Vaccine Company and Maximizes Value for Aviragen Stockholders
Updated Investor Presentation Filed with Securities and Exchange Commission and Posted to Aviragen Website
ATLANTA, Jan. 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVIR) today reiterated its support of the pending merger with Vaxart, Inc., which was unanimously approved by the Aviragen Board of Directors. In reiterating its support for and recommending that Aviragen stockholders vote in favor of the proposed merger with Vaxart at the special meeting of stockholders on February 6, 2018, the Company notes that:
The transaction maximizes the value of Aviragen: Based on the valuations of a selected set of publicly traded vaccine companies, Vaxart’s estimated potential valuation prior to the merger is approximately $158 million. Based on the ownership structure in the transaction, this would imply a value of the combined company at $264 million, with the potential value of Aviragen in the merger being $106 million, a significant improvement in value compared to Aviragen’s current market capitalization of approximately $23 million i . Aviragen stockholders will have the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of the merger: The combined company will be focused on developing Vaxart’s oral recombinant vaccines and Aviragen’s direct-acting antivirals to treat infections that have limited therapeutic options. Vaxart’s oral tablet vaccines have the potential to become major products in the worldwide vaccine market. In a head-to-head comparison with a leading injectable influenza vaccine, Vaxart’s oral tablet vaccine delivered clinical proof of efficacy and an excellent safety profile that significantly de-risks the platform. Further, the combined company will be well-financed to achieve value creating milestones that include efficacy data from Aviragen’s BTA074 HPV Phase 2 data, Vaxart’s Phase 2 norovirus vaccine data, and the filing of additional INDs for new programs. Together, Aviragen and Vaxart will be poised to create meaningful value for stockholders in the near- and long-term. Aviragen’s Board conducted a thorough process that included an extensive review of strategic alternatives: The Company’s Board formed an independent transactions committee that evaluated a number of options, including a business combination or strategic merger, in-licensing clinical stage programs, acquisitions, liquidation or other transactions that would complement Aviragen’s current assets.","Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVIR) supports its merger with Vaxart, Inc., unanimously approved by its Board, aiming to maximize stockholder value. Vaxart's pre-merger valuation is approximately $158 million, leading to a combined company value of $264 million, significantly higher than Aviragen's current market cap of $23 million. The merger offers Aviragen stockholders a potential value of $106 million. The combined entity will focus on developing oral vaccines and antivirals, with key milestones including Phase 2 data for HPV and norovirus vaccines. A special stockholder meeting is scheduled for February 6, 2018."
"Ultimately the Board – at the recommendation of the transactions committee – accepted Vaxart’s offer as Aviragen’s directors unanimously agreed that it was in the best interest of the Company’s stockholders. Aviragen notes that, compared to other unrealistic estimates that have been previously assumed by others, the realistic liquidation value of the Company was estimated at only $22.4 million – or $0.58 per share – as of October 31, 2017. More importantly, in a liquidation, there can be no assurances as to the actual amount or timing of available cash left to distribute to stockholders after paying debts, other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves. EACH VOTE IS IMPORTANT – PLEASE VOTE FOR THE PROPOSED MERGER WITH VAXART TODAY Each vote is extremely important, no matter how many or how few shares are owned. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Aviragen common stock properly cast at the Aviragen special meeting, presuming a quorum is present, is required to approve the proposed merger.

"(Reuters Health) - The more “Mediterranean” older adults’ diets are, the less likely they are to become frail over time, suggests an analysis of existing research.
The study team analyzed data on nearly 6,000 older adults who were part of four studies - three of them done in countries that actually border the Mediterranean Sea and one in Asia. No matter where they lived, people whose diets most closely followed Mediterranean diet principles were less than half as likely as those with the least-Mediterranean diets to become frail as they aged.
“The world population is aging with increasing numbers of people living to their 80s and beyond, and there is a lot of attention on how people can stay healthy and independent as they age,” the study’s senior author told Reuters Health in an email.
“Some people with accumulating health conditions and aging can become frail – that is, experience symptoms like lack of energy, muscle weakness, low appetite/losing weight and feel generally slowed up, and find it difficult to bounce back or recover when they become ill,” said Kate Walters, a researcher at University College London in the UK.
This, in turn, is associated with a risk of being admitted to hospital or becoming dependent on others for your care, Walters said. “We have been looking at ways that this can be prevented, including diet and exercise, amongst other things.”
There has been “a lot of research on types of exercise (which show this is good for you) but far less on the role of diet - for example, different types of diet such as the Mediterranean diet,” Walters added.
The Mediterranean diet is based on traditional food patterns typical of Greece and southern Italy and includes lots of plant-based foods like fresh vegetables, legumes and nuts, as well as fish and seafood. The primary source of fat is usually olive oil, rather than animal fat, and alcohol, usually wine, is included in low to moderate amounts, she and her coauthors write in Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.
The researchers reviewed and re-analyzed data from previously published studies conducted in China, France, Italy and Spain. All the studies had scored the participants’ diets according to how closely they adhered to Mediterranean principles, with a score of 6-9 representing the highest adherence and 0-3 representing the lowest. On average, participants were followed for about four years.
People whose diets scored 4-5 had 38 percent lower risk of developing frailty during the follow up period compared to those who scored 0-3, while those with a diet score of 6-9 had 56 percent lower risk.
The average age of people in these studies was 70s-80s, so the findings suggest that following this diet as an older adult may have beneficial effects in maintaining health and independence, Walters said.
The study cannot prove, however, that adhering to a Mediterranean diet is what prevents frailty, she acknowledged.
“The four included studies aren’t interventional studies (where people are assigned to eat a Mediterranean diet and some aren‘t); they’re observational studies comparing people who chose on their own to eat a certain way and their risk of frailty,” Dr. Michael Bogaisky of the Department of Medicine (Geriatrics) at Montefiore Health System in New York, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.
Any differences seen in risk of frailty may be due to other factors associated with being the type of person who eats a Mediterranean diet rather than the diet itself, he noted.
“For example, olive oil, fish, nuts, fresh fruits, and vegetables can be expensive. People who can afford these foods may also afford better access to healthcare, and that might explain why they’re more likely to have better outcomes,” Bogaisky said.
They may also be more educated or health conscious and thus more likely to eat healthier foods and more likely to exercise, all of which can influence their risk for becoming frail outside of what foods they eat, he added.
Nonetheless, he thinks it’s an “interesting finding” and that there’s strong evidence supporting eating a Mediterranean diet to prevent cardiovascular disease.
“Preventing frailty may be another reason to eat this kind of a diet,” he said.

 ","A study analyzing data from nearly 6,000 older adults across four studies found that adherence to a Mediterranean diet significantly reduces the risk of frailty as individuals age. Participants, primarily in their 70s and 80s, were followed for an average of four years. Those with a diet score of 6-9, indicating high adherence to Mediterranean principles, had a 56% lower risk of developing frailty compared to those scoring 0-3. Additionally, individuals with scores of 4-5 experienced a 38% lower risk. The Mediterranean diet emphasizes plant-based foods, fish, and olive oil, and includes moderate wine consumption. While the study suggests a correlation between diet and reduced frailty risk, it cannot definitively prove causation, as the studies were observational rather than interventional. Factors such as socioeconomic status and health consciousness may also play a role in these outcomes. Nonetheless, the findings support the Mediterranean diet's potential benefits for maintaining health and independence in older adults."
"SAO PAULO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) is looking to sell part of its operations in Brazil, where it has struggled for a decade, yet missteps by the U.S. retail giant have narrowed the field of potential buyers and could lower the value of any deal. The world’s largest retailer is shopping a major stake in its Walmart Brasil Ltda unit to buyout firms with Latin American experience, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Sunday. Wal-Mart’s operating losses in Brazil, which began in 2009, will likely attract investors with turnaround plans and modest valuations in mind, according to one of the sources, who spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the talks. The company reported almost 30 billion reais ($9.4 billion) of Brazilian revenue from about 500 stores in 2016, but poorly integrated acquisitions, labor disputes and headwinds from Brazil's economic downturn have hurt its bottom line. ( reut.rs/2DWNOtp ) Making matters worse, some stores Wal-Mart opened during Brazil’s economic boom a decade ago are poorly located and have little appeal to rivals. Several retailers passed up the chance last year to make an offer on them, the same source said. To lure buyers with the prospect of robust online growth, Wal-Mart combined its local e-commerce unit with its Brazilian brick-and-mortar operations in December, according to two people with knowledge of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer’s plans. The company declined to comment on the talks with buyout firms or its problems in the Brazilian market. Investors were largely unsurprised by reports of Wal-Mart shopping a stake in the Brazilian unit.","Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is seeking to sell a major stake in its Walmart Brasil Ltda unit after struggling for a decade, with operating losses starting in 2009. In 2016, it reported nearly 30 billion reais ($9.4 billion) from about 500 stores. Poor acquisitions and Brazil's economic downturn have diminished its appeal, leading to missed offers from several retailers. To attract buyers, Wal-Mart merged its e-commerce and brick-and-mortar operations in December."
"Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon announced in 2016 that he was planning to review global operations. “If they have decided to pull out of Brazil after being there for as long as they have, they have realized their model is not working,” said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, which owns shares of Wal-Mart. “I can definitely see Wal-Mart making similar decisions about other international businesses going forward,” he added. Wal-Mart shares closed higher on Monday but gave back some of those gains on Tuesday. FOCUSING ELSEWHERE Wal-Mart’s struggles in Brazil are a far cry from its performance in Mexico, the company’s largest market outside the United States. Wal-Mart de Mexico SA de CV ( WALMEX.MX ) is Mexico’s No. 1 retailer. That success is due to Wal-Mart’s decision to partner with Mexican retailer Cifra to launch the operation in the 1990s as well as help from local executives who have kept it attuned to the market, according to Carlos Bernal, an analyst with brokerage Actinver in Mexico. In contrast, Wal-Mart struggled to gain traction from the $1 billion it spent in 2004-2005 on a patchwork of acquisitions in northeast and southern Brazil, two regions with stark economic, geographic and cultural differences. Poor real estate investment decisions, incompatible computer systems and unforeseen tax and labor costs added to the difficulties integrating the disparate network of stores, dragging on the Brazilian unit’s earnings for years. Analysts and former executives in Brazil said one of Wal-Mart’s biggest setbacks in Brazil was losing a bidding match for cash-and-carry wholesaler Atacadão to rival Carrefour SA ( CARR.PA ), which paid $1.1 billion for it in 2007.","In 2016, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon announced a review of global operations, particularly after struggling in Brazil, where a $1 billion investment from 2004-2005 failed due to poor acquisitions and integration issues. In contrast, Wal-Mart de Mexico, its largest market outside the U.S., thrives as Mexico's top retailer, aided by a successful partnership with Cifra. Analysts noted a significant setback in Brazil was losing a $1.1 billion bid for Atacadão to Carrefour in 2007."
"Atacadão and rival Assaí, which was acquired in the same year by French retailer Casino’s ( CASP.PA ) subsidiary GPA ( PCAR4.SA ), went on to dominate the booming cash-and-carry segment, delivering profits even during the country’s recent recession. Wal-Mart’s entry into the segment was largely a flop. Wal-Mart now looks ready to focus elsewhere while retaining what may be a more passive interest in Brazil, said one of the sources familiar with the conversations between the company and private equity firms. The source added that the details of a partnership have not been clearly established. “They still want to retain a stake there so they can be around and not take attention away from what they must focus on,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “This does fit into the strategy that Doug McMillon laid out a couple of years ago. Wal-Mart is focusing more domestically where they have a dominant share.” One of the funds that Wal-Mart has spoken to, according to one source, is Acon Investments LLC, which bought regional Brazilian retailer GBarbosa in 2005 and resold it two years later to Chile’s Cencosud SA CEN.SN. Another is Advent International Corp, which invested in Brazilian apparel retailer Restoque Comercio e Confeccoes de Roupas SA ( LLIS3.SA ) and home improvement chain Quero Quero. A third, GP Investments Ltd GPIV11.LU, has a stake in sporting goods retailer Lojas Centauro, which recently filed for a Brazilian initial public offering.","Atacadão and Assaí dominate Brazil's cash-and-carry market, thriving even during recession, while Wal-Mart's entry failed.

" 12 PM / Updated 17 minutes ago British PM May says honored by French loan of Bayeux Tapestry   
SANDHURST, England (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday she was honored that France will lend Britain the Bayeux Tapestry, an 11th century treasure that tells the story of William the Conqueror’s invasion of England in 1066. 
“Our shared history is reflected in the loan of the Bayeux Tapestry to the UK in 2022, the first time it will be on British soil in more than 900 years,” May said in a statement as she welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron on a visit to Britain. 
“I am honored at the loan of such a precious piece of our shared history which yet again underscores the closeness of the UK-France relationship,” May said. 
The loan would be part of a wider cultural exchange between Britain and France over the next four years, she said. Slideshow (4 Images) 
The 70-metre long work, the precise origins of which are obscure and which has not left France in its nearly 950-year known history, is currently on display in the town of Bayeux, in the northwestern French region of Normandy. 
Macron told reporters that the France and Britain were now fighting wars together, a reference to cooperation between the two former European adversaries against armed Islamist movements including in countries Mali. 
“We are in a way making a new tapestry together,” he said. 
A French official said on Wednesday the loan would not take place immediately because work needed to be done on the tapestry to ensure it was safe to move it.

"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A remote island volcano in Papua New Guinea has begun spewing ash into the air, forcing the evacuation of more than 500 residents, media and non-profit groups have said.
Kadovar Island, a 365-metre (1,197-ft) -tall volcano on the north coast of PNG, was thought to be dormant until it began erupting on January 5.
“It’s just a continuous emission of volcanic ash at the moment,” Cheyne O’Brien, a forecaster at the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, told Reuters by telephone on Sunday.
The ash clouds have been thrown up steadily to a height of 2,133 meters (7,000 feet), forming a plume that is travelling west-northwest, he added.
The plume does not yet pose a hazard to aviation, but a change in wind direction could hit operations at PNG’s Wewak airport, O‘Brien said.
All residents of the island have been evacuated with no loss of life, U.S.-based charity Samaritan Aviation, which operates seaplanes to remote areas of PNG, said on Facebook.
“We do not have any details yet as to where all of the families have gone and hope to have further information in the near future,” the non-profit added.
Reuters could not immediately reach authorities in Papua New Guinea by telephone for comment.
The population of the island ranges from at least 500 to more than 600, media have estimated.
The eruption may become explosive, bringing a risk of tsunamis and landslides, domestic online media Loop PNG Quote: d the Rabaul Volcanological Observatory as saying.
There are no confirmed records of a previous eruption of Kadovar, said Chris Firth, a vulcanologist at Macquarie University, but scientists speculate it could have been one of two “burning islands” mentioned in the journals of a 17th-century English pirate and maritime adventurer, William Dampier.
Dampier may have recorded the last eruption of Kadovar during a voyage in search of “Terra Australis”, the southern continent once thought to be mythical, Firth said.
Vulcanologists are interested to observe its behaviour now, Firth added.
“It’s hard to predict what might happen, as there’s nothing to compare it to.”

"January 24, 2018 / 8:31 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Tennis - Volatile times ahead as slams plan return to 16 seeds Simon cambers 4 Min Read 
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Roger Federer took on Tomas Berdych in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open on Wednesday, a blockbuster clash at the business end of a grand slam event. But from 2019, under plans to reduce the number of seeds from 32 back to 16 at the four major tournaments, the match could happen in the first or second round instead. In June 2001, Wimbledon instigated the change to 32, having been spooked the previous year when a number of players, angry at being bumped from the seedings in favour of grass-court specialists, boycotted the championships. Since then, the top players have often cruised through the opening rounds, especially in the men’s draw, with the number of early shocks significantly lower than before the change. It is a change that has divided players but Federer gave it his tentative support when the plans were first announced last November. ”Having 16 seeds, that might be interesting,“ Federer said during the ATP Finals in London. ”The draw could be more volatile, better matches in the first week. “The top guys have made a habit of not cruising but getting through the first week quite comfortably for a long period of time. Playing against the numbers 17, 19 or 20 in the world is not something I really want to do, but it is what it is.”","Starting in 2019, the four major tennis tournaments will reduce the number of seeds from 32 to 16, a change first implemented at Wimbledon in June 2001. This shift aims to increase match volatility, as top players like Roger Federer, who supports the change, often face lower-ranked opponents in early rounds. The new format could lead to more competitive matches in the first week of tournaments."
"Statistically, the change reduced the number of defeats for top-16 seeds in the first two rounds at grand slams, but only really in the men’s draw. At the Australian Open, the average number of top-16 seeds losing in either round one or two averaged 7.2 in the five years before the change, falling to 3.63 between then and 2017. At the French Open, the average went from six to four; at Wimbledon, it fell from 6.5 to 4.65 and at the U.S. Open, it dropped from 6.25 to 4.11. In the women’s draw, in three of the four grand slams, the early exits even went up, marginally. At a time when players are talking about receiving a greater share of tournament revenue through increased prize money, the change should allow more players a better chance to earn more by getting further in the grand slams. Some players, though, are not so sure. “I don’t see much the benefit, for the grand slams,” sixth seed Marin Cilic said at Melbourne Park. “The draw is huge, and I think that the draw, the seeding should be the same as now.” Madison Keys, seeded 17th, joked that the women’s event did not need any more excitement, not least since 10 of the top-16 seeds went out before the third round this year, compared to only six in the men’s event. “I think the 16 seeds, I don’t understand the point of it,” Keys said.","After a rule change, the average early exits for top-16 men's seeds in grand slams decreased significantly: Australian Open from 7.2 to 3.63, French Open from 6 to 4, Wimbledon from 6.5 to 4.65, and U.S. Open from 6.25 to 4.11. Conversely, women's early exits increased in three of four slams, with 10 top-16 seeds eliminated before the third round this year."
"“I guess we need more drama and more upsets. It will be interesting, to say the least.” Some former players, on the other hand, are in favour. “With 16 seeds you have more interesting matches earlier, more fun, more excitement,” 2001 Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic told Reuters. ”You should have to work to win a grand slam. You get some parts of the draw where some guys walk to the quarter-final without losing a set, so with 16 seeds you know you could play a guy ranked 17 in the first round. “I think it’s a rule change that is good.” Paul Annacone, once ranked number 12 and a former coach of Pete Sampras, Tim Henman and then Federer, sees it from both sides. “My position as a fan is I’d like to see 16 seeds, but if I put my coach’s hat on, or players’ hat on, I get why they don’t want it,” Annacone told Reuters. ”One year I had to play (John) McEnroe first round of the U.S. Open and I was one of the next few seeded, I think,","Former players discuss the potential impact of a 16-seed format in tennis, with 2001 Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic advocating for it, citing increased excitement and competition. Paul Annacone, ranked 12th, acknowledges both fan and player perspectives, recalling facing John McEnroe in the first round."

"Brick-and-mortar retailers are using different tracking technologies to better understand their customers and keep up with e-commerce giant Amazon. Here is a sampling of the different tracking methods available to stores:
FLOOR SENSORS
Paper-thin tiles developed by Milwaukee-based Scanalytics measure foot compressions to analyze people's movements over time so stores know what products displays draw customers' attention and for how long. That allows businesses to study what sells, know when to schedule staff for busy times, and what store layout is most effective. The technology might still be too pricey for smaller retailers, however.
INTELLIGENT VIDEO CAMERAS
Companies such as Toronto-based Vendlytics and San Francisco-based Prism use artificial intelligence with video cameras to analyze body motions. That can allow stores to deliver customized coupons to shoppers in real-time on a digital shelf or on their cellphones on an app.
MOTION SENSORS
Sunglass Hut and fragrance maker Jo Malone are using laser and motion sensors from Perch Interactive to tell when a product is picked up but not bought. The technology can also make recommendations for similar items on an interactive display.
WI-FI BEACONS
Wi-Fi beacons can track customer movements — as long as they connect to the store's internet. Because not everyone opts in, stores have a smaller sample size to analyze. Another drawback is that it's not possible to tell whether a customer is inches or feet from a product.","Brick-and-mortar retailers are adopting various tracking technologies to compete with Amazon. Scanalytics' floor sensors analyze foot compressions, while Vendlytics and Prism use AI video cameras for real-time coupon delivery.

In a statement, Noble Group said net proceeds from the sale of Noble Americas Corp (NAC) to Vitol were expected to be about $400 million.
In October, Hong-Kong based Noble said gross proceeds from the deal would be about $1.42 billion and it expected to make about $580 million after repaying loans.
Noble said the lower return on the sale that closed on Jan. 12 was “primarily due to operating losses of NAC from Oct. 1 2017 to the closing date.”
The Singapore-listed company, which had a market capitalization of $6 billion in early February 2015, was plunged into crisis after a report by blogger Iceberg Research later that month questioning its accounting.
Noble stood by its accounts and rejected the report’s allegations but coupled with a major commodities downturn, the firm was unable to recover investor confidence.
Its market value has shrunk to around $200 million as it has progressively sold off large parts of its business to stay afloat.
Noble also sold U.S. gas and power business to Mercuria for less than previously announced - $168 million compared with $250 million.
Paul Brough, a restructuring specialist who oversaw part of the liquidation of Lehman Brothers, was appointed chairman last year and said he was taking steps to avoid insolvency.
The company has also been closing what remains of its global oil trading business, returning to its roots as an Asian hard commodities trader.
Noble said it had generated about $525 million in net proceeds after the sales to Mercuria and Vitol as well as monetizing what was left of its oil business within UK incorporated Noble Clean Fuels Ltd.
On top of the approximately $400 million from the Vitol deal, the trader said it had “generated over $100 million of cash proceeds” from the wind down of working capital balances in NCFL, which was largely concluded in December 2017.
Included in the total was $20 million released from escrow to the group from the deal with Mercuria.

"SHARES Getty Images Special counsel Robert Mueller (2nd L) leaves after a closed meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee June 21, 2017 at the Capitol in Washington, DC. 
Republicans are clamoring for the public release of a memo detailing alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) related to the special counsel's investigation of potential Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election. 
""The House must immediately make public the memo prepared by the Intelligence Committee regarding the FBI and the Department of Justice,"" Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fl., said . ""The facts contained in this memo are jaw-dropping and demand full transparency."" 
The rallying cry to ""release the memo"" has exploded both online and in Congress. The hashtag #releasethememo went viral on Twitter and other social media sites on Thursday, and Republican members of Congress issued statements of alarm about its contents. 
""I am shocked to read exactly what has taken place. I would think that it would never happen in a country that loves democracy and freedom,"" Rep. Mark Meadows , R-N.C., said Thursday on the House floor. ""It is time that we become transparent in all of this."" 
While still classified to the public, the four-page memo has become an instant fixation online — thanks in part to Russian propaganda accounts, according to a website claiming to track Russian influence in real time. 
The website Hamilton 68 , named after one of the Federalist papers authored by founding father Alexander Hamilton, claims to track 600 Twitter accounts ""linked to Russian influence operations."" 
The site's analytics show activity for #releasethememo increased in frequency among the tracked accounts by 265,100 percent in the last 48 hours. 
The push from some Republicans follows the release of intelligence-gathering firm Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson's testimony to the House Intelligence Committee . The prior week, Simpson's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee was released by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein . 
The memo was disclosed for House members following a party line vote within the House Intelligence Committee. It is currently only available to House members in a classified briefing room called the Congressional Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. 
President Donald Trump on Friday signed a reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, assuring Americans in a tweet that this version of the bill was ""NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election.""","In June 2017, special counsel Robert Mueller met with the Senate Judiciary Committee amid Republican calls for the public release of a memo detailing alleged FISA abuses linked to the 2016 election.

The hashtag #releasethememo surged online, with activity among 600 tracked Russian influence accounts increasing by 265,100% in 48 hours.

"Getty Images White House Chief of Staff John Kelly speaks during a White House briefing October 19, 2017 in Washington, DC. In an exasperated statement to reporters Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) identified the root of the problem in stalled negotiations between the White House and the Senate: the White House itself is divided on immigration, with hardliners dominating the discussion. On one side, there are Trump's most conservative advisers — from White House Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly and Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller, to immigration hawks on Capitol Hill — who have the president's ear. They reportedly scrapped a Democratic offer for $20 billion worth of border wall funding and are holding out for a conservative overhaul of the legal immigration system. ""Every time we have a proposal, it is yanked back by staff members,"" Graham, one of the key Republicans in immigration talks, told reporters Sunday afternoon. ""As long as Steven Miller is in charge of negotiating immigration we are going nowhere. He's been an outlier for years. ""
He tweet
On the other side of the White House drama is a president whose signature campaign promise was to build a ""great, great wall"" across the southern border and who has also said he ""loves DREAMers"" , the 700,000 young unauthorized immigrants who would lose legal protections if a deal is not reached. A package that combines the two has appealed to Trump, but not always. He wavers, switching positions seemingly on a whim.","On October 19, 2017, Sen. Lindsey Graham highlighted a divided White House on immigration negotiations, with hardliners like Chief of Staff John Kelly and adviser Stephen Miller dominating discussions. They rejected a $20 billion Democratic border wall funding offer, seeking a conservative overhaul instead. Meanwhile, Trump, who promised a ""great wall"" and supports 700,000 DREAMers, often wavers on his stance."
"While Graham said Trump himself has been open to proposals from Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans, this hardline faction has had the final word over the direction of negotiations, making it difficult to resolve a government shutdown. Suddenly Democrats are in a strange position; where they once vowed to prevent a border wall because it symbolized immigration extremism, they now see supporting one as the route to a more moderate, bipartisan deal. Read more from Vox:
Trump is proposing the ""nuclear option"" on the government shutdown. It makes no sense. The Women's March showed its power on a day Donald Trump's presidency stood still
Some libertarians cheer when the government shuts down. Here's why they shouldn't
""I'll take a bucket, take bricks, and I'll start building it myself,"" said a visibly frustrated Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), one of Congress's most progressive voices on immigration. ""We will dirty our hands, in order for the Dreamers to have a clean future in America. Then, why haven't we settled this? It's ransom. ""","negotiations to resolve a government shutdown are hindered by hardline factions, with Trump proposing a ""nuclear option."" Democrats, previously opposed to a border wall, now consider it for a bipartisan deal, reflecting a shift in strategy."
"But as long as conservative hardliners aligned with the White House stay in control, remaining unwilling to compromise — and Trump's personal beliefs remain unclear — Congress, and the government, remain at a standstill. Democrats made a major concession on the wall. But that wasn't enough. Since the start of Trump's term in office, Congressional Democrats have held firm against the southern border wall — a tangible act of resistance to the president's immigration platform. But in a scramble to get the government working again, Democrats put the wall on the table. In a White House meeting Friday, Sen. Chuck Schumer said he told President Donald Trump to name a price for the Southern border wall, and he would accept it. Trump said $20 billion in exchange for a deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, securing legal protections for nearly 700,000 young, unauthorized immigrants. Schumer thought the two of them had reached an agreement that would keep the government open and establish a path forward on immigration. Then it all fell apart. ""Yesterday, Sen. Schumer sat down and brought up some of the most delicate and tough political issue, like the wall itself.","Since Trump's term began, Congressional Democrats have resisted the southern border wall, but recently offered a compromise. In a meeting, Trump proposed $20 billion for the wall in exchange for protections for nearly 700,000 young immigrants. However, the potential agreement ultimately collapsed, leaving the government at a standstill."
"He embraced it. Two hours later, called back and rejected it,"" Durbin told Vox Saturday . ""It's very difficult to bargain with someone who is so unpredictable. ""
Durbin pointed to Kelly as the person who quashed the progress between the president and Schumer. ""As soon as the guest leaves the office, Gen. Kelly calls in the right wingers and they bat it down and say you can't do it,"" Durbin said. ""We'll never reach an agreement unless there's a more open approach at the White House and the president is more constructive. ""
It's not the first time the wall has signaled a divide in the White House. Kelly met with Democratic and Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill last Wednesday, repeating what many have known for a long time : A physical border wall will not stretch the entire southern border, Mexico won't be paying for it. Then Trump tweeted Thursday morning that the wall ""will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico. ""
Joshua Roberts | Reuters A Senate staffer places a sign blaming U.S. President Donald Trump for shutdown of the Federal Government before a news conference with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 20, 2018.","Senator Durbin criticized Gen. Kelly for obstructing negotiations between President Trump and Schumer, stating that unpredictability complicates bargaining. Kelly's meetings with lawmakers revealed that a complete border wall is unfeasible and that Mexico won't fund it. Despite this, Trump insisted via Twitter that Mexico would pay for the wall."
"The latest breakdown in immigration talks is over legal immigration
The biggest breakdown in immigration talks is no longer over the wall. Senior White House officials like Kelly and Miller have ensured that immigration negotiations prioritize ending legal immigration programs like the diversity visa program, and protections for children crossing the US border alone. Gutierrez said Kelly has ""now turned into one of the most ardent proponents of very restrictive immigration policy,"" and aligned himself with conservative immigration hardliners in the Senate including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Sen. David Perdue (R-GA). Gutierrez added he hoped a White House Chief of staff would remain independent on these issues, but said he's seeing no such autonomy from Kelly. For Gutierrez, the recent developments are a signifier of something else coming from the White House: prejudice against Hispanics and other immigrants. ""I don't really believe it's about security. It's about saying 'brown people, stay out of the country.' And the president said as much,"" he said. ""It's very demeaning to demand a wall. For me, why don't you take your middle finger and just point it at Mexico and point it at everybody.","Immigration talks have shifted focus from the wall to legal immigration, with senior officials like Kelly and Miller advocating for the end of programs like the diversity visa. Gutierrez criticized Kelly's alignment with hardliners Cotton and Perdue, suggesting a prejudiced stance against Hispanic immigrants."
"Because it's the same thing. ""
Despite seemingly agreeing to bipartisan immigration deals in the moment, Trump has repeatedly backtracked meetings with moderate Republicans and Democrats, instead doubling down on assurances he's made to conservatives. This week Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters that Trump promised not to back any immigration deal that didn't have Meadows or Cotton's blessing. Their vision, however, goes far beyond a deal Democrats could sign on to. The silence is deafening Earlier this week, Kelly met with 25 members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Publicly, CHC members said the meeting was positive, but Gutierrez said that Kelly displayed a certain ""naïveté"" as when he told lawmakers he envisioned a merit-based immigration system where people speaking English and educated were allowed into the United States. ""That's the naïveté, that you could come to 25 members of Congress whose moms and dads came out here without speaking English, and without any formal educations, and say to us, 'Those are the wrong people. Your moms and dads are the wrong people, and if they hadn't been here, I wouldn't have to be negotiating with you,'"" Gutierrez said. Since Friday afternoon, communication between the White House and the Senate Democrats seems to have gone into radio silence. As of Sunday morning, neither Trump nor Kelly had spoken with Schumer, MSNBC's Kasie Hunt reported .","Despite initial bipartisan immigration discussions, Trump has consistently reverted to conservative positions, with Rep. Mark Meadows stating Trump won't support any deal lacking their approval. Recently, Kelly met with 25 Congressional Hispanic Caucus members, who found his merit-based immigration vision naïve. Since Friday, communication between the White House and Senate Democrats has ceased, with no contact reported by Sunday morning."
"And Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), one of the moderate Senate Republicans working with Democrats to come to a bipartisan immigration deal said he knew of no communication from the White House to the Senate. ""From the White House, I don't know of any negotiations that are going on,"" Flake said. ""The only negotiations I know of are among us, here. ""
Rather than negotiating with Democrats and moderate Republicans who are working on a bipartisan immigration legislation bill, the Trump White House seems to be limiting their talks to hardline conservatives in the House and Senate. House conservatives have the president's ear. If there's going to be a DACA deal on the president's desk, some of these promises will have to be broken. But as long as Trump and Republican leaders are keep their word with conservatives, there's no deal to be had.","Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) reported no White House communication regarding bipartisan immigration negotiations, indicating that talks are limited to hardline conservatives, jeopardizing a potential DACA deal unless promises to them are broken."

"Paul LaDue scored his first NHL goal and Drew Doughty scored his 100th as the Los Angeles Kings throttled the Dallas Stars 3-0 Tuesday night at American Airlines Arena in Dallas.
Darcy Kuemper, getting a start in net as Los Angeles placed Jonathan Quick on injured reserve, stopped 28 shots to earn his second shutout in just 11 starts this season.
Quick missed the All-Star Game with what the team termed a lingering injury, but he would have drawn a one-game suspension from the NHL for opting out of the event had he remained on the active roster.
Alec Martinez also scored for the Kings, who won their second consecutive game after dropping six of seven just before the All-Star break. The Stars stayed in fourth place in the Central Division with 60 points, only one point ahead of the Minnesota Wild.
LaDue initiated the scoring at 3:05 of the first period, thanks to big efforts from linemates Alex Iafallo and Anze Kopitar. Iafallo kept the puck in the zone, and Kopitar skated around multiple defenders to set up LaDue in the right circle. LaDue wired a wrister past goalie Ben Bishop.
Doughty made it 2-0 on the power play at 5:09 of the second period. Fellow defenseman Jake Muzzin teed him up at the right point for a one-timer that Bishop appeared to stop. However, the puck escaped Bishop and appeared to nick defenseman Stephen Johns in the skate just before crossing the goal line.
Martinez added insurance only 65 seconds into the third period, shortly after a Dallas power play concluded. Bishop stopped Tanner Pearson on a breakaway, but Torrey Mitchell collected the rebound, and Martinez picked up the puck along the left boards. Martinez’s wrister tipped off a defender’s stick and beat Bishop to the short side.
Bishop made 39 saves in the losing effort as the Stars dropped their second consecutive game. Dallas failed to convert any of its four power-play chances.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is nearing completion of a new “Buy American” plan that calls for U.S. military attaches and diplomats to help drum up billions of dollars more in business overseas for the U.S. weapons industry, going beyond the limited assistance they currently provide, officials said. U.S. President Donald Trump returns to the White House from Camp David, in Washington, U.S., January 7, 2018. REUTERS/Mary F. Calvert President Donald Trump is expected to announce a “whole of government” approach that will also ease export rules on U.S. military exports and give greater weight to the economic benefits for American manufacturers in a decision-making process that has long focused heavily on human rights considerations, according to people familiar with the plan. The initiative, which will encompass everything from fighter jets and drones to warships and artillery, is expected to be launched as early as February, senior officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A key policy change would call for embassy staffers around the world to act essentially as a sales force for defense contractors, actively advocating on their behalf. It was unclear, however, what specific guidelines would be established. But under this more proactive approach, embassy staffers would engage more aggressively with foreign counterparts to push for U.S. arms sales and brief visiting senior U.S. officials so they can help advance pending deals, according to a person familiar with the matter. One senior administration official described the proposal as a “180-degree shift” in the current arms-length approach to foreign weapons sales. Trump is seeking to fulfill a 2016 election campaign promise to create jobs in the United States by selling more goods and services abroad to bring down the U.S. trade deficit from a six-year high of $50 billion.","The Trump administration is finalizing a ""Buy American"" plan to boost U.S. military exports, aiming to generate billions in overseas business for the weapons industry. This initiative, expected to launch in February 2018, will involve military attaches and diplomats acting as sales advocates for defense contractors. The approach marks a significant shift from a focus on human rights to prioritizing economic benefits, as Trump seeks to reduce the $50 billion trade deficit and fulfill a 2016 campaign promise."
"The administration is also under pressure from U.S. defense contractors facing growing competition from foreign rivals such as China and Russia. But any loosening of the restrictions on weapons sales would be in defiance of human rights and arms control advocates who said there was too great a risk of fueling violence in regions such as the Middle East and South Asia or arms being diverted to be used in terrorist attacks. ARMS REGULATIONS Besides greater use of a network of military and commercial attaches already stationed at U.S. embassies in foreign capitals, senior officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said another thrust of the plan will be to set in motion a realignment of the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR). It is a central policy governing arms exports since 1976 and has not been fully revamped in more than three decades. This expanded government effort on behalf of American arms makers, together with looser restrictions on weapons exports and more favorable treatment of sales to non-NATO allies and partners, could bring additional billions of dollars in deals and more jobs, the senior U.S. official said, without providing specifics. The strategy of having the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department take a more active role in securing foreign arms deals could especially benefit major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin ( LMT.N ) and Boeing Co ( BA.N ). “We want to see those guys, the commercial and military attaches, unfettered to be salesmen for this stuff, to be promoters,” said the senior administration official, who is close to the internal deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity. A State Department official, asked to confirm details of the coming new policy, said the revamped approach “gives our partners a greater capacity to help share the burden of international security, benefits the defense industrial base and will provide more good jobs for American workers.” The White House and Pentagon declined official comment. Defense industry officials and lobbyists have privately welcomed what they expect will be a more sales-friendly approach.","The U.S. administration faces pressure from defense contractors amid rising competition from foreign rivals like China and Russia. Advocates warn that easing arms sales restrictions could exacerbate violence in the Middle East and South Asia. The International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR), governing arms exports since 1976, may be realigned for the first time in over 30 years. This strategy could yield billions in deals and create more jobs, particularly benefiting major contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, as officials push for a more sales-friendly approach."
"Trump, a Republican, has the legal authority to direct government embassy “security assistance officers,” both military personnel and civilians, to do more to help drive arms sales. Administration officials see this group, which until now has had more limited duties such as helping to manage U.S. military aid overseas and providing some information to foreign governments for buying U.S. arms, as underutilized by previous presidents.

‘BACK SEAT’ FOR HUMAN RIGHTS? One national security analyst said that easing export restrictions to allow defense contractors to reap greater profits internationally would increase the danger of top-of-the-line U.S. weapons going to governments with poor human rights records or being used by militants. “This administration has demonstrated from the very beginning that human rights have taken a back seat to economic concerns,” said Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center in Washington. “And the short-sightedness of a new arms export policy could have serious long-term implications.” The administration officials said human rights and regional security concerns would remain part of the formula for arms sales decisions. But they said such reviews would now afford greater weight than before to whether a deal would be good for the U.S. economy and strengthen America’s defense industrial base, in which case red tape would be cut accordingly. Rules to make it easier to sell U.S.-made military drones overseas and compete against fast-growing Chinese and Israeli rivals are also expected to be in the Trump plan, officials said. Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also sought to make it easier to sell to America’s most trusted allies but in a more cautious approach that his administration billed as a way to boost American business while keeping strict controls against more dangerous arms proliferation.","Trump has the authority to enhance the role of government embassy security assistance officers in driving arms sales, which were previously limited. Analysts warn that easing export restrictions could lead to U.S. weapons reaching governments with poor human rights records. The administration plans to prioritize economic benefits and strengthen the defense industrial base, potentially easing rules for military drone sales to compete with China and Israel, contrasting with Obama's more cautious approach."
"Foreign weapons sales soared during his tenure, with the United States retaining its position as the world’s top arms supplier. Shares of the five biggest U.S. defense contractors, including Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon Co ( RTN.N ), General Dynamics Corp ( GD.N ) and Northrop Grumman ( NOC.N ) have more than tripled over the last five years and currently trade at or near all-time highs. Foreign military sales in fiscal 2017, comprising much of Trump’s first year in office and the final months of Obama’s term, climbed to $42 billion, compared to $31 billion in the prior year, according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The Trump administration has already moved forward on several controversial sales. Those include a push for $7 billion in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia despite concerns they have contributed to civilian deaths in the Saudi campaign in Yemen’s civil war and the unblocking of $3 billion in arms to Bahrain, which was also held up by human rights concerns under Obama. Similar concerns have been raised over the administration’s preparations to make it easier for American gun makers to sell small arms, including assault rifles and ammunition, to foreign buyers. A draft of the overall policy recently finished by teams of State, Defense and Commerce Department officials coordinated by Trump’s National Security Council must now be approved by a senior cabinet members before being sent to his desk, the government","During Trump's tenure, foreign military sales surged to $42 billion in fiscal 2017, up from $31 billion the previous year.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will not hold a second referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union, her spokesman said on Thursday in response to growing calls for a new vote on Brexit.
Earlier, Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said he was warming to the idea of holding a second referendum, arguing that another vote would see “Leave” win again and end the debate. Many pro-EU supporters also support another vote, saying Britons were not given all the information in the first referendum and that public opinion was changing.

"EMERGING MARKETS-Currencies jump as dollar dips; Argentina's Merval breaches 35,000 Rodrigo Campos Published 11:05 AM   
35,000@ (Updates with final prices, Mexico details) NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The Mexican peso touched its strongest against the dollar in nearly four months on Thursday as the U.S. currency continued to weaken, while Argentina's Merval stock index briefly broke above the 35,000-point mark for the first time. Many emerging currencies hit multi-year highs against the greenback, with the dollar index languishing at more than three-year lows after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin departed from traditional U.S. currency policy, saying ""obviously a weaker dollar is good for us."" Colombia's peso added to Wednesday's 1.4 percent gain against the dollar to reach its strongest since July 2015, while the Chilean peso could close under 600 per dollar for the first time since May 2015. Brazilian markets were closed for the Sao Paulo anniversary holiday but are expected to soon extend a rally that boosted the benchmark Bovespa stock index to an all-time high above 83,000 points on Wednesday. That advance came after an appeals court upheld a corruption conviction of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Although the conviction could derail his plans to run again for the presidency, Lula, who is leading opinion polls for the October election, said on Thursday he would appeal the decision. Brazilian and Argentine shares have led a Latin American equities rally to start the year that has MSCI's gauge of the region's stocks set for its largest January gains since 2006.

"A petition in South Korea against cryptocurrency regulation has reached the number of signatures that would induce a government response. 
As of Tuesday morning, ET, more than 212,700 had signed a petition launched Dec. 28 on the website of the South Korean presidential office. A Google translation of the website states that if more than 200,000 people support a petition within 30 days, officials will respond. 
""Our people have been able to make a happy dream that they have never had in Korea because of virtual money,"" the anonymous author of the petition wrote, according to a Google translation. ""People are not stupid. ... virtual money is invested because it is judged to be the fourth revolution."" 
The petition did support South Korea's recent actions on cryptocurrencies, such as banning anonymous trading accounts . 
""However, I wish that the economy will not decline due to unjustifiable regulations in the present situation,"" the Google translation of the petition said.
Unemployment among South Korean youth, or those ages 15 to 29, is around 9 percent, nearly three times the national average, according to Statistics Korea. Young people are generally more interested in buying and selling digital currencies than their elders.
In the last several months, South Korea has accounted for a significant portion of the trading volume in digital currencies such as bitcoin, ethereum and ripple. Earlier this month, ripple prices appeared to plunge in U.S. dollar terms after CoinMarketCap said it was excluding price information from some Korean exchanges due to ""extreme divergences in price from the rest of the world."" 
South Korean regulators have become increasingly vocal in the last few weeks on trying to limit speculation in digital currencies. 
Bitcoin briefly fell more than 17 percent to a six-week low after South Korea Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said that shutting down digital currency exchanges is still an option for the government, according to an English-language report Tuesday from South Korea's Yonhap News. 
However, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said in a separate Tuesday report from Yonhap that shutting down the digital currency exchanges would require approval from the National Assembly.","A South Korean petition against cryptocurrency regulation has garnered over 212,700 signatures since its launch on December 28, surpassing the 200,000 threshold for a government response. The petition expresses concerns about potential economic decline due to regulations, amidst a youth unemployment rate of 9%, nearly three times the national average. South Korea has been a significant player in digital currency trading, with recent volatility affecting prices, including a 17% drop in Bitcoin after government comments on exchange shutdowns."

"January 13, 2018 / 1:04 PM / Updated 9 hours ago New U.S. sanctions attempt to influence Russia before election: Tass   
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A new round of U.S. sanctions expected against Moscow is an attempt to influence Russia’s domestic affairs ahead of a presidential election, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov   on Saturday. 
Washington is expected to impose fresh penalties against Russia as soon as early February for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential vote. Russia has repeatedly denied this. 
Moscow expects the United States to present two anti-Russian reports with the sanctions, Ryabkov told Tass news agency. 
One of the reports will likely extend the number of Russian officials and companies on the sanctions list, while the other will analyse whether sanctions so far have proved to be effective, Ryabkov said. 
“We see this as yet another attempt to influence our internal situation, especially ahead of the presidential election,” he said. 
Russia will hold its next presidential vote on March 18 when President Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win another six-year stint. 
In August, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law a new package of sanctions drafted by U.S. lawmakers. The new legislation also limits Trump’s own ability to lift any sanctions against Russia. 
The first U.S. sanctions against Russia were imposed in 2014 for its role in the Ukrainian crisis and for annexing Crimea. The European Union has also imposed penalties against Moscow, prompting it to retaliate with banning food imports from countries that sanction Russia. 
The new round of U.S. sanctions could possibly include a ban on the purchase of Russian treasury bonds. Reporting by Andrey Ostroukh; editing by Clelia Oziel","On January 13, 2018, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov stated that new U.S. sanctions, expected in early February, aim to influence Russia's internal affairs before its presidential election on March 18, where President Vladimir Putin is anticipated to secure another six-year term. The sanctions, linked to alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election, may expand the list of sanctioned Russian officials and companies, and could include a ban on purchasing Russian treasury bonds."
"(Reuters) - Toshiba Corp said on Thursday it had clinched an agreement to sell its claims in bankrupt U.S. nuclear plant maker Westinghouse Electric Co LLC in a deal that would add $3.7 billion to the Japanese owner’s depleted capital base.
The Japanese conglomerate has also agreed to transfer its Westinghouse-related shares to Canada’s Brookfield Business Partners ( BBU_u.TO ), which earlier this month agreed to buy the unit for $4.6 billion - money that will be used to repay the nuclear plant maker’s creditors.
These deals could help clear Westinghouse’s path out of bankruptcy before Toshiba’s financial year ends in March, while also allowing the Japanese firm to resolve its negative net worth and stay listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Toshiba said in a statement that it would sell its claims against Westinghouse to a group of hedge funds led by the Baupost Group, and that the deal that would contribute about 410 billion yen ($3.68 billion) to its capital base.
The deal, first reported by Reuters earlier in the day, will make the group of hedge funds Westinghouse’s biggest creditor, helping cut down the fights among several creditors that had threatened to slow down the resolution of the bankruptcy.
The group led by Baupost has already bought claims worth more than $2.2 billion from Scana Corp, a South Carolina utility that contracted Westinghouse to build two reactors.
The South Carolina project, and another in Georgia, went billions of dollars over the fixed-price contract, forcing Westinghouse into bankruptcy in March.
FILE PHOTO: The logo of the American company Westinghouse is pictured in Le Bourget, near Paris October 14, 2014. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo Westinghouse’s bankruptcy pushed Toshiba into a crisis and prompted Toshiba to sell its memory chip business for $18 billion to shore up its balance sheet. The Japanese firm also forecast a negative net worth of 750 billion yen at end-March.
But finances are set to be shored up by the Baupost deal, which includes an after-tax profit of about 170 billion yen from the sale of claims and tax benefits of about 240 billion yen, Toshiba said. It added the company would promptly announce any revised forecasts as appropriate.
Toshiba shares rose as much as 2.9 percent in early trade on Thursday, and was flat at around 0443 GMT, while the Nikkei was up 0.46 percent.
Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, which traces its roots to the 19th century, was acquired by Toshiba in 2006 for $5.4 billion at a time of increased interest in cleaner fuel sources.
In recent weeks, Citibank N.A. on behalf of the Baupost group of hedge funds has claimed it is owed as much as $7.5 billion by Westinghouse, alleging among other things gross negligence. The allegations are based on the South Carolina claims that the Baupost group has acquired.
Westinghouse disputed the new claims and said it threatened to delay the resolution of the case.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One U.S. service member was killed and four others wounded during a “combat engagement” in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, the U.S military said in a statement on Tuesday. 
The incident took place on Monday in Achin, Nangarhar province, the statement said. 
Two of the wounded service members are being treated at a medical facility and in stable condition, it added. 
Nangarhar, on the porous border with Pakistan, has become a stronghold for Islamic State, generally known as Daesh in Afghanistan, which has grown to become a dangerous militant group since it appeared around the start of 2015. 
The Taliban and Islamic State have frequently fought each other in Nangarhar and both have been targeted by sustained U.S. air strikes. 
The exact nature of the relationship between the two groups is little understood. There have been isolated incidents in Afghanistan in which the fighters of both appear to have cooperated. 
There are currently about 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan and under President Donald Trump’s South Asia strategy, U.S. troops are allowed to accompany Afghan forces at the battalion level, potentially putting them at greater risk.

"January 30, 2018 / 3:21 PM / Updated an hour ago Eleven EU members back Swiss in dispute with Brussels Reuters Staff 3 Min Read 
ZURICH/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Finance ministry officials from 11 European Union countries have backed non-member Switzerland in a dispute with Brussels over Swiss stock exchange access to the single market, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Tuesday. 
The letter to the European Commission from the 11 -- including Germany, Austria and Britain -- said Switzerland was treated unfairly last month when its exchanges got only one year of market access. 
Bern has threatened to retaliate against what it calls unacceptable discrimination, hurting ties with its main trading partner that had been easing after the Swiss parliament in 2016 skirted voters’ demands for immigration quotas on EU citizens. 
The Commission must certify that other countries’ exchanges have rules in place that are equivalent to new EU standards. 
All 28 EU members except Britain, which is leaving the EU, backed the one-year access proposal in December after the Commission changed tack from an original proposal in November for unlimited Swiss access, which won member approval. 
Such a switch was warranted “only in very exceptional cases”, the letter said. 
“Although we did not express our opposition to the resubmitted draft equivalence decision due to the need for an equivalence decision to be in place for 3 January 2018, we continue to pursue the goal of an unlimited equivalence recognition of the legal and supervisory framework applicable to stock exchanges in Switzerland,” it added. 
One EU diplomat said there was a risk of setting a dangerous precedent that might be used for Britain after its exit from the bloc. 
A Commission spokesman stressed that the eventual decision had been unanimous. 
“The fact that somebody then after the decision wrote a letter is another matter,” he said. 
Bern wants the same regulatory status for Swiss bourses as those in other countries have, enabling EU investors to trade in Switzerland, a crucial source of exchange volume. 
Diplomatic sources say the hardball approach arose from Commission ire over Swiss foot-dragging on a new treaty that Brussels wants to replace a patchwork of 120 bilateral accords now governing ties. 
The project has hit obstacles as right-wing and conservative parties in Switzerland baulk at giving the European Court of Justice a say in settling disputes over EU laws that Switzerland would have to adopt as the price of enhanced access to the single market. 
Many argue that Switzerland should await the outcome of British-EU Brexit negotiations before signing any new accord. 
New Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis is supposed to present his cabinet colleagues on Wednesday with proposals to break the logjam. Reporting by Michael Shields in Zurich, Philip Blenkinsop in Brussels; Editing by Adrian Croft","On January 30, 2018, finance officials from 11 EU countries, including Germany, Austria, and Britain, supported Switzerland in a dispute with Brussels regarding Swiss stock exchange access to the EU single market.

Switzerland's government threatened retaliation, citing unfair treatment and potential harm to relations with the EU. The ongoing negotiations are complicated by Switzerland's reluctance to cede authority to the European Court of Justice, with new Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis expected to propose solutions."

Ben Simmons posted a triple-double consisting of 19 points, 17 rebounds and 14 assists in leading the Philadelphia 76ers past the visiting Chicago Bulls 115-101 Wednesday night at the Wells Fargo Center.
Simmons registered his fifth career triple-double in just his 43rd NBA game. Only Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook (14) and Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (seven) have more triple-doubles than Simmons this season.
Joel Embiid scored 22 points, Dario Saric added 21 points and 10 rebounds and Robert Covington contributed 16 points for the Sixers, who moved two games above .500. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot and Justin Anderson had 12 apiece.
For Embiid, it was his 26th game of at least 20 points this season.
The Sixers were short-handed without guards T.J. McConnell (personal reasons), JJ Redick (leg) and Jerryd Bayless (wrist).
Philadelphia never trailed and led by as many as 25 points as it has won eight of its last 10 games.
The Bulls were led by Bobby Portis with 22 points and 11 rebounds. Zach LaVine scored 21 points, Nikola Mirotic added 15 and Lauri Markkanen had 12. David Nwaba contributed 10.
The Sixers were hot from beyond the arc, going 16 of 32.
The Bulls, however, hit just 11 of 37 from 3-point territory after starting 4 of 24.
Chicago made a brief push in the fourth with an 8-0 run, but the Sixers responded with a jumper by Covington and a three-point play by Embiid for a 108-88 advantage with 4:35 left.
It was more than enough of a cushion.
Embiid knocked down a 3-pointer for a 25-point bulge, 79-54, with 4:24 remaining in the third.
The Bulls did run off eight in a row to close within 79-62, but Philadelphia was still able to end the third up 85-67.
Simmons nearly compiled his triple-double by halftime with 11 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists, and the Sixers held a 55-41 lead at the break. Simmons swept 11 rebounds in the first quarter alone and nearly tied a franchise record for rebounds in a quarter held by Hall of Fame center Wilt Chamberlain.

"BUENOS AIRES, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Argentine biotechnology firm Bioceres will use the $100 million it seeks by way of an initial public offering to power its current business, pay debt and make a minor acquisition, company CEO Federico Trucco said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
Two days earlier the company applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate on Wall Street.
Bioceres is a developer of agricultural genetics in Argentina, the world’s top exporter of soymeal livestock feed.
“The capitalization is fundamentally for a growth plan having to do with the commercialization of products that we have ready today,” Trucco said. “There is going to be a minor acquisition and repayment of debt.”
Rosario-based Bioceres develops genes for soy, corn and wheat that withstand drought and cold temperatures. It makes insecticides, fungicides, bio-fertilizers and chemical-based fertilizers.

Badoo owned 79 percent of Bumble as of March 2016, according to TechCrunch . While Bumble is Badoo's largest U.S. property, Badoo's eponymous dating app has been one of the most downloaded dating apps in the world.

Bumble is best known for its dating app, which allows only women to initiate online conversations after a man and woman ""match"" by swiping right on each other's picture. The #metoo movement and growing attention to female empowerment against sexual harassment has made Bumble a particularly enticing asset to own right now, one of the people said.
The Bumble app has user growth of about 100 percent year over year, making it one of the fastest-growing dating properties, one of the people said. The app had more than 12.5 million users last year, according to Forbes.
In October, Bumble expanded its offerings with a business networking app called BumbleBizz. Like the main app, it will allow only women to initiate conversations.
Badoo is owned by Russian entrepreneur Andrey Andreev.

WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao urged the nation's railroads and transit agencies to take all possible measures to meet deadlines to install a safety system called positive train control (PTC) to prevent crashes.
Letters dated Dec. 27, which were made public on Tuesday, said Chao wanted railroads to ""greatly accelerate"" efforts to meet congressional deadlines. A deadly Amtrak crash last month near Seattle that killed three occurred on a section of track that did not have the PTC system operating.
The system is designed to prevent derailments caused by excessive speed. Investigators have said several deadly U.S. train crashes in recent years could have been prevented if the system was in place.
In 2008, Congress mandated the implementation of PTC nationwide by the end of 2015, then extended that deadline until the end of 2018 when its installation became more complex than anticipated. The government can extend the deadline to 2020 to complete some aspects of the system.
The National Transportation Safety Board said last month the Amtrak train that derailed onto a highway near Seattle was going 78 miles per hour (125.5 km per hour) in a 30-mph zone.
The letters went to the chief executives of railroads, including Amtrak, BNSF Railway Co, Canadian National Railway , CSX Corp, Norfolk Southern Corp, Union Pacific Corp and transit systems in Chicago, Boston, New York, Boston, Newark, Seattle and Los Angeles.
Amtrak said last month it was ""imperative that the rail industry urgently work together to get PTC activated on the national network as soon as possible - and certainly by the December 2018 federal deadline, if not before.""
The Transportation Department said 12 of 41 railroads covered by the requirements report having installed less than 50 percent of the hardware required for their PTC systems as of Sept. 30. The government said the systems are in operation on 45 percent of route miles owned by freight railroads and just 24 percent of passenger railroads
Chao's letter said the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) leadership plans to work with railroads ""to help create an increased level of urgency to underscore the imperative of meeting existing timeline expectations for rolling out this critical rail-safety technology.""
The Association of American Railroads said on Tuesday that railroads are making progress on installing and testing PTC technology and freight railroads are on track to meet the deadlines established by Congress.
Separately, the Transportation Department wrote to U.S. senators on Tuesday asking them to approve the nomination of Ronald Batory to head the FRA. Batory, a former Conrail president, was approved unanimously by a committee but has been held up due to a dispute over a New York area infrastructure project.

"January 11, 2018 / 8:37 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Walmart wage hike may show wage pressures building for lowest paid Reuters Staff 5 Min Read 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart’s tit-for-tat minimum wage battle with Target, ratcheting to $11 an hour for the least experienced workers with likely pressure to move higher, may signal broader gains to come for workers in a tightening U.S. labor market - a moment politicians and policymakers have been hoping for. There are still problems, labor economists note, with overall wage gains weaker than would be expected with a 4.1 percent unemployment rate, comparatively large numbers of people in part time jobs, and millions of prime age adults between 25 and 54 years old not even looking for work. But the Wal-Mart Stores Inc announcement, its third boost in entry level wages in as many years, is a possible sign wage pressure is building in general, as gains filter down to the lowest-paid jobs and the least-educated workers. “This may be evidence that we are starting to see the wage acceleration,” that officials at organizations like the Federal Reserve have been anticipating as unemployment dropped to a 17 year low, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs website Indeed. That, in turn, could boost U.S. economic growth overall and strengthen a U.S. inflation rate whose weakness has bedeviled the Fed for the last five years. Kolko noted that while overall wage increases were modest last year at around 2.5 percent, data through November showed that workers with only a high school degree got average raises of 3.6 percent, while hourly rates for less well-paid positions rose 3.1 percent. Wage increases at the lower end of the scale are typically a sign that labor markets are tight, said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “When you get low unemployment rates, that affects lower-wage workers the most,” Gould said. “Slack is diminishing.”","Walmart has increased its minimum wage to $11 an hour for entry-level workers, marking its third wage hike in three years amid a tightening U.S. labor market with a 4.1% unemployment rate. Despite overall wage growth being modest at 2.5%, workers with only a high school diploma saw average raises of 3.6%, while lower-paid positions experienced a 3.1% increase. This trend may indicate growing wage pressure for the lowest-paid workers, potentially boosting U.S. economic growth and inflation."
"Whether slack is fully gone, however, is another question, and one which policymakers at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere are struggling to understand. Along with the headline unemployment rate, a broader measure of joblessness that includes discouraged workers who have largely stopped job-hunting, as well as those only able to find part-time jobs, stood at 8.1 percent at the end of 2017. That is comparable to the hot economy years before the 2007 to 2009 economic crisis. The Fed’s Beige Book research report in recent months has been filled with anecdotal stories, gathered by policymakers from the central bank’s 12 regional branches, of entrepreneurs struggling to fill positions and of wage pressures building. Even at 2.5 percent, current wage growth is “likely to be greater than inflation, which means households would continue to enjoy gains in purchasing power,” Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist with the Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a recent analysis. But the Fed isn’t claiming victory yet. Job creation is expected to slow in coming months, as it inevitably does late in a recovery, with unemployment now well below the 4.6-percent level central bankers estimate the economy can sustain over the long run. Yet, participation rates for prime-age workers remain around three percentage points below their late 1990s peak, translating into around 3 million 25- to 54-year-olds who could be employed or looking for jobs. “We still have many months, if not a year or two, to get as tight we like,” said Gould. The Walmart announcement may also be a product of dynamics other than the demand and supply of labor.","As of late 2017, the broader joblessness rate was 8.1%, comparable to pre-crisis levels, while current wage growth stands at 2.5%, likely outpacing inflation. Unemployment is below the Fed's long-term sustainable estimate of 4.6%. Participation rates for prime-age workers are about 3% lower than the late 1990s peak, equating to roughly 3 million individuals aged 25-54 who could be employed or job-seeking."
"The company said it was merely passing along to workers some of the savings it will get from a cut in the corporate tax rate. But Target Corp, a main competitor, pushed its entry level wage to $11 last fall and has pledged to hit $15 by the end of 2020. In addition, states have been steadily raising the legal minimum wage, with 14 now at $10-an-hour or more as of this year. California hit $11 on Jan. 1 and New York will move to $11.10 this summer. Wal-Mart employs around 130,000 people in the two states out of a U.S. workforce of 1.5 million, according to the company’s website. Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Nick Zieminski","Wal-Mart employs 1.5 million in the U.S., with 130,000 in California and New York, where minimum wages are $11 and $11.10, respectively, as 14 states reach $10 or more."
"(Adds Etsy also plans to join the lawsuit)
WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The Internet Association, a trade group representing companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, said on Friday that it intends to join an expected lawsuit against a decision to roll back net neutrality rules.
One of the group's members, e-commerce site Etsy Inc , said that it would separately also join the legal effort. Several states including New York, and public interest advocacy groups have said they intend to sue to stop the mid-December ruling by the Federal Communications Commission.
The approval of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal in a 3-2 vote marked a victory for internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, handing them power over what content consumers can access.
Democrats, Hollywood and companies such as Google and Facebook had urged Pai, a Republican appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump, to keep the Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content.
""The final version of Chairman Pai's rule, as expected, dismantles popular net neutrality protections for consumers. This rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,"" the Internet Association said in a statement.
Etsy called the decision to overturn net neutrality rules ""deeply disappointing.""
""Etsy is continuing to fight for a free and open Internet; thats why we intend to challenge Chairman Pais order in the courts,"" Althea Erickson, Etsy's head of advocacy and impact, said in a statement.
The new rules give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but must have new transparency requirements that will require them to disclose any changes to consumers.
Internet Association members also include Airbnb, Amazon.com and several dozen online and social media companies.

"January 17, 2018 / 3:58 PM / a few seconds ago India's Kohli says team must reflect on South Africa defeat Reuters Staff 2 Min Read 
PRETORIA (Reuters) - India captain Virat Kohli wants his team to reflect on their decision-making and commitment after a 135-run second test defeat by South Africa on Wednesday handed the hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. 
Kohli cut a visibly disappointed, and at times irritated, figure after his side failed to chase down 287 for victory, losing seven wickets in the morning session on the final day to be bowled out for 151 in their second innings. 
“We have not come here to play the way we have done,” Kohli told reporters at the post-match news conference. 
“That is something that we need to definitely speak about. We need to be hard on ourselves. We need to ask ourselves if we are giving 120 percent for the team every time we bowl a ball or play a ball or field a ball. 
“That is something individuals need to reflect on themselves, but as a team we are definitely going to lay out these things in the open. We will ask the guys to be honest about what they were feeling at particular stages in the game. 
“Unless you speak about it and lay it out in front of everyone, there is very little chance of improving. The mistakes that we made have been really about not putting attention to detail at important stages of the game.” 
Kohli appeared particularly irritated when quizzed on team selection and whether the right XI had been selected for the second test, saying he and the selectors had picked a side they believed could win the test. 
“What’s the best XI?” he said. “You are telling me we could have played the best XI. So you tell me the best XI and we’ll play that. I‘m saying the loss obviously hurts. But you make one decision and you back it. 
“We certainly don’t sit here and say, ‘Oh, if you fail in one game you are not good enough to be at this level. 
“We played with teams before that have looked really strong and have lost as well.”

"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled on Wednesday that Twitter Inc is not liable to families of two U.S. government contractors killed in an Islamic State attack in Jordan for having failed to block that group from using its accounts and messaging services.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that the families failed to show that the Nov. 9, 2015 shooting deaths of Lloyd Fields and James Creach at a police training center in Amman resulted from Twitter’s knowing material support of Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attack.
Circuit Judge Milan Smith said no damages were justified under the federal Anti-Terrorism Act because the plaintiffs, who include the victims’ widows, did not show “at least some direct relationship” between their injuries and Twitter’s conduct.
He said the plaintiffs did not show any connection between Twitter and the shooter, Jordanian police officer Anwar Abu Zeid, or that the attack was helped by or resulted from Islamic State’s presence on Twitter. The gunman was later killed by local security forces.
“Communication services and equipment are highly interconnected in modern economic and social life, such that the provision of these services and equipment to terrorists could be expected to cause ripples of harm to flow far beyond the defendant’s misconduct,” Smith wrote. “Nothing in [the law] indicates that Congress intended to provide a remedy to every person reached by these ripples.”
Joshua Arisohn, a lawyer for the families, said in an email that his clients were “extremely disappointed” and were weighing their legal options.
“Requiring a more direct connection between the provision of material support to terrorists and the attacks that they carry out contravenes the central purpose of the Anti-Terrorism Act: holding enablers of terrorists accountable,” he said.
Twitter and its lawyer, Seth Waxman of WilmerHale, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Wednesday’s decision upheld an August 2016 ruling by U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco.
Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc have also faced damages lawsuits for allegedly letting entities that U.S. authorities view as terrorist groups use their online platforms.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Human rights in Bahrain have deteriorated significantly in the past year because international pressure on the Gulf Arab kingdom has weakened, activists said on Thursday.
“Bahrain is now clearly sliding in a new and very dangerous direction with 37 people arrested yesterday alone,” said Brian Dooley of U.S.-based Human Rights First.
“The fairly weak level of restraint that was there before has all but gone,” he said, adding that countries influential in Bahrain such as the United States and Britain needed to step up their criticism.
Bahrain, where the Shi‘ite Muslim majority is ruled by a Sunni Muslim royal family, has pursued a crackdown on opposition activists since quashing 2011 protests calling for democracy.
Authorities have closed opposition political groupings, revoked dissidents’ passports and arrested suspected militants. Activists say many arrests are for political reasons and breach detainees’ human rights.
Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet is based, denies clamping down on dissent. It says it faces a militant threat backed by arch-foe Iran on the opposite side of the Gulf.
The Bahraini Embassy in Britain, responding to a request for comment, cited an earlier statement which said that the Gulf state was committed “to transparency and the protection and safeguarding of Human Rights enshrined in the Constitution, as well as in international treaties and obligations”.
Human rights activists, at a news conference in Lebanon on Thursday, said the situation has taken a turn for the worse with 19 people now sitting on death row, renewed reports of torture in detention and military courts now trying civilians.
In January 2017 Bahrain executed three Shi‘ite men convicted of killing three policemen in a 2014 bomb attack. They were the first such executions in over two decades, and sparked protests.
Bahrain is due to hold parliamentary elections in 2018.
The activists also said they have concerning new information about the health of detained prominent rights campaigner Nabeel Rajab, and demand he be given access to adequate healthcare.
“Recently alarming signals have multiplied ... regarding his detention condition,” said Dimitris Christopoulos, president of human rights organization FIDH, calling for his release. Rajab is FIDH’s deputy secretary general.
Rajab, a leading figure in the 2011 pro-democracy protests, has been in and out of detention since that time. He faces up to 15 years in jail over Twitter statements he made about the war in Yemen. A verdict is expected on Feb. 21.
“Nabeel is in real danger,” said Sheikh Maytham Al-Salman from the Bahrain Center for Human Rights.
Bahraini authorities said Rajab had received medical checks twice in December and January and his health was “stable”.
“We take very seriously the safety and wellbeing, including healthcare both in terms of access and adequacy, of any person, whether in prison or in detention,” the director general of the prisons authority said in a statement.

Modi hosted the Israeli leader in his home state of Gujarat where hundreds of people waving Indian and Israeli flags lined up the streets as the motorcade passed. 
The two men, accompanied by Netanyahu’s wife, Sara, went to Gandhi’s ashram on the banks of a river where Netanyahu tried his hand at a spinning wheel, a pastime Gandhi made popular while he was jailed during British colonial rule. 
“An inspiring visit to the hearth of one of humanity’s great prophets of inspiration - Mahatma Gandhi”, Netanyahu and his wife wrote in the guest book.

Netanyahu and Modi have pledged to deepen economic and security ties in a more open embrace of the relationship which New Delhi had long kept at a low profile, largely for fear of upsetting Arab nations on which it depends for oil. 
Modi said India’s cooperation with Israel was diverse and benefited both countries. On Tuesday, Netanyahu said the two countries were discussing ways to strengthen cooperation to fight the menace of radical Islam that they both faced. Slideshow (3 Images) 
On Thursday, Netanyahu will travel to Mumbai to join a memorial event for the parents of an 11-year-old Israeli boy who was among the 166 people killed during an attack by Pakistan-based militants in 2008. 
Ahead of that trip, a small group of people staged a protest in Mumbai holding placards denouncing Netanyahu and accusing him of atrocities against Palestinians. 
Arabs and Muslims across the Middle East, the European Union and the United Nations have all opposed the U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital last month as an incendiary move in a volatile region and Palestinians said Washington was abandoning its leading role as a peace mediator. 
Israel, by contrast, applauded Trump’s move. Netanyahu said it was “an important step towards peace” and it was “our goal from Israel’s first day”.

" 58 AM / in 16 minutes EU says banks' bad loan woes ease but need capital buffer hikes Francesco Guarascio 3 Min Read 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union banks’ holding of bad loans is decreasing but remains high, the European Commission said on Thursday as it prepares measures to force higher provisioning for future soured debt. 
The 2008-2009 global financial crisis left European banks saddled with piles of non-performing loans (NPLs) which they struggled to recoup from distressed firms and households. 
But as the bloc’s economy recovers, the amount of bad debt is slowly receding, the European Commission said in a report. Using data from the European Central Bank, the EU executive said NPLs accounted for 4.6 percent of banks’ total loans in the period between April and June, a 1 percentage point drop from a year earlier. 
Despite the trend, bad loans were still worth 950 billion euros ($1.16 trillion) in the 28 EU countries and accounted for 5.4 percent of total loans in the euro zone, the European 19-country currency area. 
To tackle the problem, the Commission is planning new legislative measures, probably in March, to speed up banks’ unloading of bad debts and to prevent a future build-up of NPLs. 
An overhaul of insolvency rules and a strengthening of the secondary market for bad loans are among the measures planned to reduce the existing stock of soured debt. 
Against a future growth of NPLs, the Commission plans to introduce “statutory prudential backstops to prevent the risk of under-provisioning of NPLs,” the Commission said in a document, stressing that this would apply only to “newly originated loans that later turn non-performing”. 
The move clarifies the Commission’s intentions. It had previously said legislative measures on buffers were possible but not certain. 
It will still need to decide what could constitute a new loan and when the requirements would apply, EU officials said. 
There is still debate on whether new loans should include restructured debt and new payments of installments on old loans. 
The cut-off date for new loans is also under discussion. The Commission is considering four options: last November; the date of publication of the new proposals, likely to be in March; the date of the entry into force of the new measures, which could be two years away; or an even later date. 
Italy, one of the EU countries with the highest level of bad loans, has long called for a gradual reduction of NPLs to avoid fire sales that would leave huge holes in banks’ balance sheets. 
Other states, led by Germany, have called for a faster offloading of bad loans to reduce risks in the banking sector, which could lead to euro zone’s deeper financial integration. Reporting by Francesco Guarascio; editing by Philip Blenkinsop","As of April to June 2023, non-performing loans (NPLs) in EU banks accounted for 4.6% of total loans, a 1 percentage point decrease from the previous year, totaling approximately €950 billion ($1.16 trillion). In the euro zone, NPLs represented 5.4% of total loans. The European Commission plans to introduce new legislative measures in March 2024 to enhance banks' provisioning for future NPLs, including reforms to insolvency rules and the secondary market for bad loans. Italy advocates for a gradual reduction of NPLs, while Germany supports a quicker offloading to mitigate banking sector risks and promote deeper financial integration in the euro zone."

"In light of the new year, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to zoom in on two of the market's top benchmarks to see how they'll fare in 2018: the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average .
So the "" Mad Money "" host recruited technician Bob Lang, the founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and one of the three minds behind TheStreet.com's Trifecta Stocks newsletter, to get an analytical take on the action.
Cramer and Lang began with the weekly chart of the S&P. For the first time ever, the index did not have a single losing month in all of 2017, perhaps even more impressive than its nearly 20 percent annual gain.
""With so much momentum coming into this year, Lang thinks it would be a big mistake to get too bearish on this one,"" Cramer said.
In the fourth quarter, more stocks in the S&P started to trade above their 50-day moving averages, a good indicator of the breadth and strength of the index's rally.
Cramer attributed the strength to institutional buying after the S&P's small dip in November, and said that the strategy was a winning one going forward as well.
""Until we see any evidence that these institutions want to start selling en masse, and we have none, Lang thinks you should keep buying the S&P into any dip if we get one,"" Cramer advised. ""Last year, the S&P only had two pullbacks, and they both went to its 20-week moving average ... and both [of] these turned out to be excellent buying opportunities.""
All in all, Lang wouldn't be surprised if the S&P logged yet another double-digit gain in the new year, he told Cramer.
What of the Dow industrials? First and foremost, Cramer noted the average's 25 percent gain for 2017, calling its weekly chart ""picture-perfect.""
From the Chaikin money flow oscillator, which measures buying and selling pressure, to the Relative Strength Index, which measures momentum, the Dow's technical indicators were red-hot for most of 2017, indicating high levels of institutional buying.
""From a momentum perspective, Lang says this chart is a thing of beauty,"" Cramer said. ""Volume trends are positive, the money flow remains very strong — what's not to like?""
Lang even said that trying to call a top for the Dow would be ""pointless"" given its strength and predicted a 12 to 15 percent rise in 2018, keeping the possibility of Dow 30,000 on the table.
""[These] charts give us a lot of reasons to be feeling pretty darned good about 2018,"" Cramer said. ""No, we don't want to get too euphoric. No, we don't want to be complacent. But I also think it's a big mistake to get too cynical — that's right, too sardonic — for your own good. Irony never made a dime for anybody. Let's face it: we've got a phenomenal bull market going here. Why don't you just enjoy it?""

Technician Bob Lang noted that the S&P's strength was bolstered by institutional buying, particularly after a small dip in November, with only two pullbacks that provided excellent buying opportunities. Lang predicts another double-digit gain for the S&P in 2018. The Dow's technical indicators, including the Chaikin money flow oscillator and Relative Strength Index, indicated strong institutional buying, leading Lang to forecast a 12-15% rise, potentially reaching Dow 30,000. Cramer emphasized the importance of maintaining a positive outlook amidst the ongoing bull market."

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drone sales in 2017 topped $1 billion for the first time ever, but don’t raise a glass too quickly if you are in New Jersey, where lawmakers are poised to outlaw drunken droning next week.
It is one of a wave of U.S. states moving to bring the unmanned aircrafts’ high-flying fun back to earth.
New Jersey’s Assembly is slated to vote on a bill approved by the state Senate to ban inebriated or drugged droning, as well as to outlaw flying unmanned aircraft systems over prisons and in pursuit of wildlife. The vote was set for Thursday but postponed until Monday because of a severe snowstorm that triggered a state of emergency in New Jersey.
“It’s basically like flying a blender,” said John Sullivan, 41, of New York, a drone buff and aerial cinematographer. He said he opposed drunk droning but also fretted about regulatory overreach. “If I had like one drink, I’d be hesitant to even fly it.”
A 2015 drone crash on the White House lawn fueled debate in the U.S. Congress over the need for drone regulations.
It was a drunken, off-duty employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency who flew the 2-foot-by-2-foot (60 cm by 60 cm) “quadcopter” from a friend’s apartment balcony and lost control of it over the grounds surrounding the White House, the New York Times reported.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo New statistics set for release next week show 3.1 million drones were sold in the United States last year, up 28 percent from 2016, said Richard Kowalski, manager for the Consumer Technology Association.
“This was the first year that drone revenues reached $1 billion,” Kowalksi said in an email.
At least 38 states are considering restrictions on the devices this legislative year, including Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina, said Amanda Essex, senior policy specialist for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
“Like any technology, drones have the ability to be used for good, but they also provide new opportunities for bad actors,” said Assemblywoman Annette Quijano of Elizabeth, New Jersey. She backed the bill, which would impose a punishment of up to six months prison and a $1,000 fine for drunk droning.
If the Assembly passes the bill, Governor Chris Christie must sign it into law before he leaves office in less than two weeks or the legislation is dead, said Quijano’s Chief of Staff Shane Derris.
Already, nine states prohibit drones from operating near or over prisons, including Arizona, Louisiana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin, Essex said.
A drone carrying wire cutters and a cell phone likely aided a prisoner’s escape in July from a maximum security prison in South Carolina, officials said.

 ","In 2017, U.S. drone sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time, with 3.1 million drones sold, marking a 28% increase from 2016. New Jersey lawmakers are set to vote on a bill to ban drunken or drugged droning, alongside restrictions on flying drones over prisons and wildlife. The vote, originally scheduled for Thursday, was postponed due to a snowstorm. If passed, violators could face up to six months in prison and a $1,000 fine. Currently, 38 states are considering drone regulations, with nine already prohibiting drone operations near prisons. The push for regulation intensified after a 2015 drone crash on the White House lawn."
