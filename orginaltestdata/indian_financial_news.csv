The Commerce Department said on Friday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, plunged 13.6 percent last month. That was the biggest drop since the government started tracking series in 1959, and followed a 6.9 percent tumble in March.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending plummeting 12.6 percent in April.

https://www.businesstoday.in/top-story/state-run-banks-need-urgent-capital-of-rs-1-trillion-due-to-weak-market-valuations-crisil/story/288921.html,"State-run lenders require an urgent Rs 1.2 trillion in the capital in the next five months and government will have to take a bulk of the tab due to the weak market valuations of these NPA-saddled banks, says report.

This is a little more than double the budgeted Rs 53,000-crore of capital infusion for the current fiscal year, Crisil senior director Krishnan Sitaraman said in a report Tuesday.

If the government decides to meet this need, this will put further pressure on the fiscal maths, thus its ability to meet the 3.3 per cent fiscal deficit target for the current fiscal year. Already the government has used up over 95 per cent of the deficit target or the market borrowings as of October end.

The report comes even as the government is asking the Reserve Bank to lower the minimum capital requirements by getting it at par with global practices-something the central bank is uncomfortable to meet.

It has also reported having turned down the finance ministry demand to transfer Rs 3.6 trillion of it's over Rs 9.5 trillion reserves, which government wants to use to recapitalise the bleeding banks.

Till now, only Rs 1.12 trillion have been infused into these lenders since October 2017, it said, adding just Rs 12,000 crore has come from the markets, it said.

Most of the required capital has to be infused into the 11 lenders who are under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework of the RBI, wherein depletion in the capital and return on assets, combined with a surge in non-performing assets, has resulted in the severe restrictions on normal operations, it said.

""Given their weak performance and low valuations, state-run banks have little ability to tap the market, which means the government will have to provide most of the requirement,"" it said.

Sitaraman said the Rs 1.5 trillion infused by the government in the last three financial years has only helped them cover the losses of Rs 1.3 trillion incurred during the same period.

Profitability of state-run banks has been under pressure because of higher credit costs after the RBI tightened norms for recognition of stressed assets and their resolution, the report explained.

Most of the 21 state-owned banks have reported huge losses in recent years, and a good number of them will be in the red this fiscal as well which will put a strain on the capital, notes the report.

As per the norms, the banks ought to have their tier-I capital at 9.5 per cent, including the capital of conservation buffer (CCB) of 2.5 per cent, it said, adding if the CCB were to be excluded, the capital requirement will fall to Rs 40,000 crore from Rs 1.2 trillion.

Meeting the CCB requirement, introduced following the 2008 global financial crisis, is becoming difficult for many state-run banks and those under PCA have had to recall their additional tier-1 bonds in recent times impacting their capital adequacy, it said.

Thirteen of the 21 state-owned banks had their tier-I ratio below the regulatory norm as of the June quarter, the report noted.

Moves like the consolidation of weaker banks with stronger ones like the tri-merger between Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Andhra Bank will help reduce the additional capital required, its associate director Vydianathan Ramaswamy said.

Listing other imperatives, he said the quantum of capital infusion has to increase, risk-weighted assets need to be brought down, and better-performing banks have to be nudged towards the market for capital.","government will have to take a bulk of the tab due to weak market valuations, report says. this is more than double the budgeted Rs 53,000-crore of capital infusion for current fiscal year. government has already used up over 95 per cent of the deficit target or the market borrowings. report comes as the government is asking the Reserve Bank to lower the minimum capital requirements.",Negative
https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/covid-19-apparel-exporters-body-pitches-for-amnesty-scheme-for-non-fulfilment-of-export-obligations/1902593/,"Apparel exporters on Wednesday urged the government to bring an amnesty scheme in case there is non-fulfilment of export obligations as traders are facing issues in terms of raw material supply on account of the coronavirus outbreak.

Under some export promotion schemes like Advance Authorisation and Export Promotion Capital Goods schemes, import of machines and raw materials used to make exportable products is allowed at zero duty but with an export obligation.

Exporters are of the view that in such a scenario, meeting these obligations would be a bit difficult for them.

In a letter to Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) Chairman A Sakthivel said apparel trade is deeply integrated with the global value chain and it has been impacted by the disruption in both imports and exports.

Uncertainties are developing over timely deliveries of imports of raw materials like fabric, and accessories supplies, and exporters are facing tough situation with regard to export orders as global buyers are asking for deferment of consignments.

He said the need of the hour is to “bring out an amnesty scheme for non-fulfilment/short-fulfilment of exports under various export obligation schemes, especially in a force-majeure (unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract) situation such as the present one”.

Sakthivel added that the current situation warrants urgent remedies and support from the commerce ministry.

“Since the last one week, many of the major brands and buyers from the US and EU have asked for postponement of orders or shipments which have completely upset our business and schedule,” Sakthivel said.

He added that such uncertainties, coupled with a weak demand position in major markets have started impacting the order position, production schedules, inventory pile up, working capital and export realizations.","exporters are facing issues in terms of raw material supply on account of the coronavirus outbreak. some export promotion schemes allow import of machines and raw materials used to make exportable products at zero duty but with an export obligation. a letter to commerce and industry minister Piyush goyal said apparel trade is deeply integrated with the global value chain. a weak demand position in major markets have started impacting the order position, production schedules, inventory pile up, working capital and export realizations.",Negative
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/asias-mood-tested-by-trumps-tariff-threats-3221631.html,"Asian shares battled to extend a global rebound on Tuesday after US President Donald Trump seemed to quash hopes of a trade truce with China, dampening risk appetite across the region.

Japan's Nikkei managed to edge up 0.4 percent, but MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was all but flat.

E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 eased back 0.35 percent, after rising sharply overnight.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he expects to move ahead with raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent currently.

Trump said it was ""highly unlikely"" he would accept China's request to hold off on the increase, planned for Jan. 1.

The comments ran counter to recent speculation about a possible deal when Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this week.

""Trump's pessimistic view on the chances of a game-changing China trade deal may puncture global equity markets' optimistic start to the week,"" said Sean Callow, a senior FX analyst at Westpac in Sydney.

""Combined with last week's harsh report from the U.S. trade representative, investors have only the flimsiest hope that the Trump-Xi meeting in Argentina will amount to more than a hill of soybeans.""

That put trade-sensitive currencies, including the Australian dollar, on the defensive, while the dollar lost some ground on the safe haven yen to 113.47.

The euro edged up a shade to $1.1333 and the dollar dipped to 97.038 against a basket of currencies.

OIL SHIFTS RISKS ON INFLATION, FED

Shares in Apple Inc fell after-hours in reaction to Trump's comments that tariffs could also be placed on laptops and iPhones imported from China.

Trump's remarks came just as the mood among investors had shown signs of brightening and Wall Street took heart from an upbeat holiday shopping period.

Even oil managed to regain a little ground after the gut-wrenching slide of recent weeks.

The Dow ended Monday up 1.46 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 1.55 percent and the Nasdaq 2.06 percent.

The rally came after the S&P 500 on Friday recorded its lowest close in six months, down more than 10 percent from September's peaks and back in ""correction"" territory.

In commodity markets, oil prices had climbed nearly 3 percent on Monday in what was seen as largely a technical correction after weeks of losses.

Early Tuesday, US crude was off 4 cents at $51.59 a barrel. Brent crude futures had closed up $1.68 at $60.48 a barrel.

Analysts at National Australia Bank noted the steep retreat in oil would drag on US inflation in coming months, perhaps offering further reason for the Federal Reserve to go slower on tightening.

""This is a starkly different picture to just a few months ago,"" said NAB's market strategist Tapas Strickland.

""A stable to lower inflation outlook means there is no urgency for the Fed to hike rates,"" he added. ""An early 2019 pause is thus becoming more probable.""

The futures market has already shifted to imply two more hikes at most next year, while the Fed itself is predicting three and more in 2020.

https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/six-psus-now-fallen-angels-after-indias-sovereign-rating-downgrade-covid-19-took-toll-says-moodys/1985892/,"After India’s sovereign credit rating fell to lowest investment grade ‘Baa3’ early in June, six Indian public-sector undertakings (PSUs) have also taken a hit with them now becoming potential “fallen angels”. These six companies in the non-financial sector viz — Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Oil India, Petronet LNG, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation — are now just one step away from being considered junk, global ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service said on Tuesday. “Fallen Angels” are those companies which were earlier in the investment grade category and have slipped to sub-investment grade.

As the coronavirus pandemic has afflicted markets and economy around the world, the Asian list of potential “fallen angels” has reached an all time high of 21 in early June owing to the addition of six Indian PSUs, the agency said. The quantum of names in the list has doubled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 21 Asian companies, which now risk becoming fallen angels, have over $12.3 billion of outstanding bonds maturing in 2021. Of this $12.3 billion, about one-fourth at $3.3 billion are rated. The six Indian companies which have been added to the potential “fallen angels” category are state-run enterprises in the oil and gas sector. They have $1 billion of rated bonds coming up for repayment till 2021, the agency said.

India leaves China behind, but, that is no good news

Since 2008, Chinese companies have dominated the “fallen angels” list which has lately become a domain of Indian and South Korean companies.

Moody’s downgraded its rating on India by a notch recently after worries over growth and the fiscal strain abound. India’s current rating is the last level in the category classified as “investment grade”. “The country’s policymaking institutions will be challenged in enacting and implementing policies which effectively mitigate the risks of a sustained period of relatively low growth, significant further deterioration in the general government fiscal position and stress in the financial sector,” Moody’s said in a statement after downgrading India rating. However, the effect of the cut is likely to be short term on investment flows.","six Indian public-sector undertakings have taken a hit with them now becoming potential ""fallen angels"" the Asian list of potential ""fallen angels"" has reached an all time high of 21 in early June. the 21 Asian companies, which now risk becoming fallen angels, have over $12.3 billion of outstanding bonds maturing in 2021. of this $12.3 billion, about one-fourth at $3.3 billion are rated.",Negative

https://www.financialexpress.com/money/real-estate-revival-holds-key-to-building-a-stronger-economy/1935475/,"It was largely expected. With a view to curb the spread of Covid-19, the 21-day lockdown which was imposed earlier across the country has been extended by another 19 days albeit with partial relief given after 20th April in some parts or regions of the country. The biggest pandemic faced by mankind in over a century, which originated in China and soon engulfed the entire world including most of the developed as well as developing nations, has impacted one and all. With restriction on the movement of people as well as goods & services, barring some of the essential services, the economic activities are currently at a standstill. Needless to say, the lockdown would have a jeopardising impact on the economy.

The Early Growth Indicators

There is a near consensus amongst most of the economists that World economy would slip into recession, with many of them even predicting that the current slowdown would be far worse than that of 2008 financial crisis and next only to ‘Great Depression’. The IMF’s Economic Counsellor has named it the ‘Great Lockdown’ and has estimating the cumulative loss to global GDP over 2020 and 2021 at around $9 trillion, which is greater than the economies of Japan and Germany put together.

Thankfully, India is among the handful of countries that is projected to record positive growth and at 1.9%, India’s growth rate is projected to be the highest among the G-20 nations.

Measures unveiled by Government & Authorities

To curb the impact of pandemic, Governments and authorities across the globe have announced several relief measures. The United States has passed a record $2 trillion Corona relief package. Other countries have also announced similar measures.

Domestically, the Indian government too has announced a relief package to the tune of Rs 1.7 lakh crore, which is mostly aimed at economically weaker section of the society. Compared to relief package announced by some of the major economies, the relief package announced by India is much smaller as it is merely 2% of the GDP as compared to relief packages of the US, Japan, UK & others wherein it is to the tune to 10-12% of GDP. Thus, there is greater expectation that the government would soon unveil another relief package for industries.

The Reserve Bank of India too has done its bit. It has already announced several measures in two tranches. Complementing the Government’s efforts, the apex bank towards the end of March lowered repo rate by 75 basis points to 4.4% and infused liquidity in banking system to the tune of Rs 3.74 lakh crore. It also lowered the reverse repo by 90 bps to 4%. It also announced moratorium of 3-month on repayment of all term loans, including retail loans and on advances to MSMEs.

With the economic growth scenario remaining under cloud, the apex once again intervened on April 17 and announced further reduction in reverse repo to 3.75% besides providing additional liquidity of Rs 1 lakh crore to NBFCs and All India Financial Institutions like NABARD, SIDBI & NHB. It has also announced certain relaxation on loan classification and provisioning as well.

Real estate may offer panacea for economy

One of the reasons that the Indian economy is struggling to attain 7.5-8% kind of growth is the state of real estate. The last few years have been challenging for the sector as it underwent tremendous transformation due to Demonetisation, RERA and GST implementation. The Covid 19 is further likely hit the sector hard, with some of the reports suggesting extreme pessimism regarding the sector.

But as Mahatma once famously said: “In the midst of death life persists, in the midst of untruth truth persists, in the midst of darkness light persists.” – the sector still remains the second largest employer and is an essential cog in India Inc, with close to 300 industries relying on it for growth purposes. Thus, it is utmost important that some measures are announced to revive the sector, which in turn may immensely benefit the economy.

a) One Time Loan Restructuring

One of such measures could be developers’ long-pending demand of restructuring of existing loans for a period of 12 months. Amid the challenging times, the sales of housing units have remained subdued for the last couple of years. This in turn has adversely impacted the loan repayment capacity of a substantial chunk of developers. The unrest caused by Covid 19 is further likely to aggravate the situation. Thus, it would be apt that the Government or the Reserve Bank of India announces one-time loan restructuring for 1 year. This would ensure that developers would have sufficient liquidity at their disposal, which would enable them to turn the tide. Also, with no defaulter tag, developers would be able to raise additional finance from various institutions. Needless to say, it would help in faster completion of project and would create substantial employment opportunity.

b) Waiver of Stamp duty

The other major initiative, which may help the sector revive, is waiver of stamp duty for a limited time period. With stamp duty being one of the biggest sources of revenue, various state governments have substantially hiked circle rate over the years. In many of cases, the hike is not in sync with market realities. As such, stamp duty based on unrealistic circle rate is a major deterrent in buying of properties. Thus, it would be apt that states waive off stamp duty for a limited period. The move would help in the revival of the sector.

c) Special Window for HFCs/ NBFCs

Banks have been reluctant to finance realty projects over the last few years. In absence of it, the sector has heavily relied upon NBFCs and HFCs for its financial requirements. But post the IL&FS as well as DHFL fiasco, even that source of funding has dried up to a large extent. Even some of the HFCs and NBFCs are facing liquidity squeeze. In the wake of the same, providing a special window of finance for HFCs/ NBFCs would not only help them at this critical juncture, but in turn would help in the revival of the realty sector as well.

And there is little doubt, if real estate is able to get its mojo back, the Indian economy would also return to its 8-plus per cent growth rate soon.

Sena's support for Manmohan Singh, a noted economist, came after the Centre dismissed his criticism of handling of the economy by the Modi-government. The Sena, through an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana, asked the government to pay heed to the former PM's warning and not indulge in politics over the issue.

Last week, Manmohan Singh had termed the state of the economy as ""deeply worrying"" and said that the June quarter growth rate of 5% shows that India is in the midst of a prolonged economic slowdown. ""India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate, but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slowdown,"" Singh said in a statement.

However, the government rebuffed Singh's criticism on Tuesday, saying it does not subscribe to his analysis as India has now become the world's fifth-largest economy from 11th during his time.

""The economy is in doldrums. Kashmir and economic slowdown are two different issues. A learned person like Manmohan Singh there should be no politics around the economic slowdown and experts should be roped in to repair the economy. National interest lies in listening to Manmohan Singh's advice,"" the editorial in Saamana said.

The Sena once again cited demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as the main reasons for the slump in the economy.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fiis-turn-net-sellers-in-indian-markets-but-it-is-not-because-of-budget-4885251.html,"Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have turned net sellers, pulling out more than Rs 2,000 crore in from Indian markets in the past four days. The move was not on account of the Budget but on global growth concerns, say experts,

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will table the Budget on February 1. The Nifty has slipped more than 1 percent, so far, in January, and about 3 percent from the record high of 12,430 recorded on January 20.

A snapshot of the 10-day activity of foreign investors suggests that the consensus seems to be short in index futures largely because of global growth concerns fuelled by coronavirus outbreak.

The World Health Organization on January 30 declared the coronavirus epidemic in China a public health emergency of international concern, said a Reuters report. Most economists have already lowered the growth forecast for China by 100-200 bps.

“FIIs are selling aggressively in the Indian equity market for the last few days but it has no correlation with the upcoming Union Budget because they are pulling out their money from emerging markets amid fear of short-term economic slowdown due to worries over coronavirus,” Amit Gupta, Co-Founder, TradingBells, told Moneycontrol.

“It is a global issue which is worrying FIIs because as per past behaviour, emerging markets tend to underperform amid such kinds of issues. FIIs are not only selling in the cash market, they are also betting on the short side via the F&O market,” he said.

Gupta added that FIIs have 60% net short positions in the index futures and these shorts may help in the short-covering rally if something major positive comes up in the Budget.

Even the rollover activity for the February series suggests a cautious stance by traders ahead of the big event.

The Nifty rolls stood near 66.30 percent, compared to the three-month average of 72.13 percent. Market-wide rolls stood at 86.45 percent against the 3-month average of 90.19 percent.

“As the D-Day of Budget 2020 draws nearer, FIIs have pulled back 2,371 crores of funds from the market in order to reduce their exposure and analyse the market. The last few days have been full of quarterly results thereby causing required price changes,” said Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor.

“The Federal Reserve fixed the rate between 1.50-% 1.75%, FIIs seem to be planning to wait for perfect opportunities and invest in handpicked value stocks on the Budget Day and afterward.”

What will cheer FIIs in Budget?

Investors are pinning hopes on some relaxation in personal tax and tweaks in the Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) and the Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT). A low fiscal slippage will also make FIIs happy, say experts.

“The abolishment of LTCG and the rationalisation of DDT may change FIIs' sentiments for the Indian equity market. If the government comes out with any major reforms to boost consumption in the economy, then FIIs will once again head towards the Indian equity market,” says Gupta of Gupta TradingBells.

“There are some worries about the fiscal deficit but if the government will be able to give proper road map that it will manage to bring back the fiscal deficit in a comfortable range in the future then FIIs will be happy,” said Gupta.

He added that there is a high demand from the FIIs community from the government to come out with significant steps to strengthen the Indian financial sector which is the key worry of foreign investors for the last one year.

These were crucial to an eight-month-long investigation by the Competition Commission of India CCI ) in 2010 and 2011 to expose a cartel in India’s cement industry, which resulted in a penalty of Rs 6,317 crore, the regulator’s highest in a single case to date.The CCI has since carried out many probes into alleged anti-competitive agreements and companies’ abuse of their dominant position, but it is still best known for the cement cartel case mainly because of the eye-popping fine. It is nearly half of the Rs 13,523 crore the CCI levied in 135 cases till March 2018, according to the latest data available with the regulator. Of its total fines, the CCI has collected a mere Rs 55 crore, or 0.4%.Compare this to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), which collected $172 million in criminal penalties in fiscal year 2018 (October-September), with the highest ever being $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2015. It has also sent several executives to prison.While the CCI cannot boast figures like DoJ, the very fact that it has the authority to severely penalise violators could be working to its advantage. Meanwhile, some of the recommendations made by the Competition Law Review Committee (CLRC), which submitted its report recently, could make CCI more nimble in the resolution of cases and take it a little closer to its counterparts in the EU, the UK and the US.It was in 2010, almost a decade ago, that the CCI, which had only become operational in May 2009, decided to probe its most high-profile case — to find out if 10 cement companies colluded through the Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA) to limit supplies and raise prices. The CCI said that after two of three CMA meetings at Mumbai’s Grand Hyatt and Hotel Orchid in early 2011, the companies hiked cement prices, which, the CCI said, “establishes that they co-ordinated their decisions and fixed prices after due consultations”. There were also questions over whether Ambuja Cement and ACC, which are part of the Swiss company LafargeHolcim, had attended two of these meetings despite no longer being members of the CMA.The companies and the CMA disputed the CCI’s findings and appealed the penalty. The case has made its way through the Competition Appellate Tribunal, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ( NCLAT ), which replaced the former in 2017, and is now pending before the Supreme Court, which asked the parties to deposit 10% of the penalty last year. Aparna Dutt Sharma, secretary general, CMA, did not respond to a request from ET Magazine for comment. Questions sent to Lafarge-Holcim, UltraTech Cement and Jaiprakash Associates, which were handed the highest penalties, also went unanswered.The delay in the conclusion of this case — and others where fines were levied — has meant that companies have not coughed up what the CCI asked them to. Should that be a cause for concern? Kaushal Kumar Sharma, the first director-general of the CCI, says it would be wrong to equate deterrence to realisation of penalties. Vaibhav Choukse, partner, competition law, J Sagar Associates, concurs. “Companies do not want to be on the wrong side of the competition law as there is a huge reputational loss from a penalty.” A listed company will have to make disclosures to the stock exchanges in case it is fined by the CCI, which could drive its shares down.“It’s not that the CCI wants to make money. The CCI’s idea in the early days was to make a splash and say, ‘We have arrived,’” says a competition lawyer, requesting anonymity. Nisha Kaur Uberoi , national head of competition law at Trilegal, a law firm, says the CCI has created deterrents through a combination of factors: “its ability to levy India’s highest economic penalties on companies, imposition of individual liability as well as advocacy to foster a culture of competition compliance”. By individual liability, she is referring to the CCI’s powers to penalise the directors of an errant company.Ashok Kumar Gupta, chairman, CCI, recently told ET that penalties are not an end in themselves in any enforcement process. “In numerous cases, parties rectify their anti-competitive behaviour during the enquiry process itself so the market correction as such has taken place.”As of March 2018, the CCI had noted 940 competition cases, ordered probes into 400 and completed investigations in 288. Even before the cement cartel case, a CCI order in 2011 gave India Inc an inkling of the regulator’s powers. It investigated the realtor DLF’s conduct in relation to one of its apartment buildings in Gurgaon and found that the company had set terms unfavourable to buyers in their agreement, like their inability to raise objections to changes in the structure by the builder. The CCI report added: “Despite knowing that necessary approvals were pending at the time of collection of deposits, DLF Ltd inserted clauses that made exit next to impossible for the buyers.”The CCI fined DLF Rs 630 crore, which the realtor appealed; the matter is now in the apex court. Also before the Supreme Court is an appeal related to a Rs 591 crore penalty on Coal India for discriminatory terms in fuel-supply agreements. DLF and Coal India did not respond to questions sent by ET Magazine. Besides looking at anti-competitive agreements like cartels and abuse of dominance, the CCI also has to greenlight mergers and acquisitions beyond a certain size. The CCI, set up under the Competition Act, 2002 (amended in 2007), replaced the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission.The CLRC, which the government set up last year, has recommended a series of changes to the CCI. These include a dedicated NCLAT bench for competition cases, given that NCLAT is overburdened with cases under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. Though there is no NCLAT-specific data, as of September 30, there were nearly 1,500 IBC cases pending before the NCLAT or the Supreme Court, according to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India.Some of the report’s suggestions could make the CCI dispose of cases quickly. The introduction of settlement and commitment procedures, for instance, could help avoid pendency of cases. In the EU, which has had settlements since 2008, half the cartel cases are resolved using settlements, in which the parties admit to their guilt in exchange for a 10% reduction in penalties. Since 2004 the EU has also had commitments, in which the parties agree to change their behaviour. The US DoJ has consent decrees, which need to be court-approved.Another recommendation made by the CLRC is that the CCI should be transparent in how it arrives at penalties, like in the EU and the UK. “It’s as if the CCI is pulling figures out of a hat,” says Aditya Bhattacharjea, professor at the Delhi School of Economics and a member of the CLRC.The CCI, according to CLRC recommendations, can levy a penalty of up to 10% of the average turnover of the preceding three years in matters related to abuse of dominance. In case of cartels, it can impose a fine of up to 10% of their turnover or up to three times their profit in each year of the period during which the cartel existed, whichever is higher. “Having penalty guidelines will be good for the CCI when it has to defend its orders in courts,” says the competition lawyer quoted earlier.Regardless of when these recommendations are incorporated into the law, experts say companies could make use of an existing provision to minimise a crippling penalty. A company engaged in an anti-competitive agreement with its competitors can alert the CCI to the existence of the cartel and cooperate in the investigation in the hopes of being waived a part, or the whole, of its fine.Panasonic Energy utilised the lesser penalty option and went to the CCI in 2016 and admitted that it was part of a cartel with Eveready Industries and Indo National (which sells under the Nippo brand), aided by their industry association, to control the distribution and prices of zinc-carbon dry cell batteries, since 2008. Eveready and Indo National also availed of the lesser penalty provision. As a result, the CCI waived 100% of Panasonic’s Rs 75 crore penalty, and reduced Eveready’s and Indo National’s fines by 30% and 20%, respectively, to Rs 172 crore and Rs 42 crore.Cracking down on cartels without one of the participating companies coming forward is not easy, especially since in some cases the CCI may not have more than circumstantial evidence to base its conclusions on. An even bigger challenge is dealing with violations in the fast-evolving world of technology.Acting on information filed by Jaipur-based Consumer Unity & Trust Society and Matrimony.com, the CCI in 2018 fined Google Rs 136 crore for promoting its own specialised search — say, for flights — to the detriment of other websites. The order was stayed by NCLAT. Google is also being probed by the CCI for tying some of its apps to Android and limiting handset makers’ ability to sell devices with alternate versions. “Android has enabled millions of Indians to connect to the internet by making mobile devices more affordable. We look forward to working with the CCI to demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less,” says a Google India spokesperson.Google’s dominance has been under scrutiny in the EU and the US as well. Since 2017, it has been fined a total of $9.3 billion by the EU in three different cases related to its abuse of dominance by favouring its advertising and shopping services over its competitors’ and for bundling some of its applications with Android. (Google has appealed all three orders.) It is also being investigated in the US and so are Facebook and, reportedly, Amazon. “Other than in the EU, competition regulators are exercising caution (with tech companies) because consumers are benefiting from these companies,” says Bhattacharjea.While India may have got a competition authority later than several other countries, new technologies are coming to India soon after they are launched elsewhere. This is why Sharma, former CCI director general, believes that handling tech matters may not be too hard for the CCI. One of the emerging areas of concern for competition regulators worldwide is artificial intelligence-powered pricing algorithms of competitors colluding to fix prices. Who is to be held responsible here in the absence of executives of rival companies acting in tandem?In addition to instances of cartelisation and abuse of dominance in the old-economy sectors, the CCI will have to increasingly deal with competition cases in businesses like ecommerce, ridehailing, food delivery and online travel aggregation (the CCI is currently investigating MakeMyTrip and Goibibo, which merged in 2017, and Oyo Rooms over allegations of predatory pricing, among others). The CCI has also made clear its intent to pursue cases on its own without a formal complaint. But what is unlikely to change, till the CLRC recommendations are implemented, is the time it takes for a case to reach its conclusion.","competition commission of india investigated a cement cartel in 2010 and 2011. regulator's highest in a single case to date was Rs 6,317 crore. of its total fines, the CCI has collected a mere Rs 55 crore, or 0.4%. of its total fines, the CCI has collected a mere Rs 13,523 crore.",Negative

Kolkata: Reliance Jio Infocomm is poised to race ahead of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to emerge as India’s No. 1 telco by revenue share and customers by 2021 and 2022, respectively, brokerage Sanford C Bernstein said.The Mukesh Ambani-led telco, it said, would relentlessly continue to subsidise its popular 4G VoLTE feature phone, called JioPhone, till these twin goals are realised.“Shareholders of Reliance Industries (Jio’s parent) are not complaining, preferring to see Jio continuing to gain share, and we believe neither Airtel nor Vodafone Idea have the stomach to engage in a pointless subsidy war,” Bernstein said in a note to clients.The global brokerage, in fact, expects the two older carriers to look forward to a time when Jio would start monetising its (customer) base through higher pricing after wresting market leadership.Jio’s pricing aggression since its entry in September 2016 forced incumbents to match rates to retain customers, galvanising consumption of voice and data services. Big incumbent carriers were hurt, while fringe players that couldn’t withstand the brutal price war exited and the sector consolidated down to three large private players — Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, among the older ones, and Jio.More recently, strong performances in crucial states and rural mobile markets, have seen Jio boost revenue market share (RMS) by as much as 375 basis points (bps) sequentially to over 26% at the end of September. By contrast, Airtel’s RMS dipped 75 bps to 30.9% amid revenue losses in seven key markets, while VIL’s plunged 190 bps on-quarter to 32.8%, amid revenue slides nearly across India.Jio’s recent Monsoon Hungama offer of exchanging any old feature phone for a JioPhone for about `1,000 (including six months recharge) also proved a runaway hit with users of plain vanilla phones who upgraded to 4G and contributed to the sharp upsurge in the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco’s subscriber base in the September quarter.Airtel’s refusal to fight Jio in the VoLTE feature phone space has come at a heavy price. The telco lost as many as 6.6 million subscribers in the September quarter, while Jio reported a 37 million customer additions during the same taking its total base to over 252 million. Current market leader, Vodafone Idea, which has also refused to counter Jio in the 4G feature phone segment, similarly also lost 13 million customers in the fiscal second quarter, stung by a mix of brutal price wars and rising costs.Small wonder, Bernstein estimates Jio to reach 28% RMS and 26% subscriber share by March next year, especially if Airtel and VIL don’t counter Jio’s call to subsidise its 4G feature phone.“Both Bharti and Vodafone managements have indicated they don’t believe in handset subsidies for prepaid users; so if left unchallenged, Jio could reach the leading revenue market share position by 2021 and by subscribers by 2022,” the global brokerage said.Analysts also expect Airtel and VIL’s decision to unveil minimum recharge plans amid ongoing customer losses to Jio, will see both telcos collectively losing 56 million customers by the fourth quarter of FY19.","mukesh ambani-led telco will continue to subsidise its popular 4G VoLTE feature phone, called JioPhone, till these twin goals are realised. the two older carriers will look forward to a time when Jio would start monetising its (customer) base through higher pricing. big incumbent carriers were hurt, while fringe players that couldn’t withstand the brutal price war exited.",Negative
https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/energy/decline-in-global-gas-prices-credit-positive-for-indian-consumers-icra/story/408523.html,"The plunge in global gas prices is credit positive for the domestic consumers in the medium-term because it will compel industrial and commercial consumers to convert from alternate fuels, ICRA said in its latest report.

Asian spot prices of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have declined to about $2 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) due to increase in supplies coupled with slow demand in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly 29 million tons of liquefaction capacity was added in calendar year (CY) 2019 over 37 million tons added in CY2018.

""Even though LNG trade grew by the highest ever at 40 million tons in CY2019, the demand was outpaced by supply, depressing spot prices. Going forward, another 163 million tonnes of LNG capacity is expected to be added over 2020 to 2025 leading to supply outstripping demand which would continue to weigh on prices,"" ICRA said.

The report added that the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to drag the world GDP into 3 per cent contraction. ""The timing of the recovery in the global economy is uncertain and expected to be prolonged, due to which the demand growth of natural gas is expected to remain muted over the medium term, owing to which prices are expected to remain under pressure,"" it said.

Besides, crude oil prices have also declined precipitously due to slump in demand on account of coronavirus outbreak which would also pressurise LNG prices, it added.

""Owing to the unprecedented supply additions, high inventories and demand destruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic, LNG prices have declined to all time low levels. Mirroring the trend in LNG prices, gas prices at various international hubs have also declined to multi-year lows. Henry Hub prices currently at around $1.5/mmbtu, reflect the excess supply despite the recent production cuts amid unprecedented demand destruction due to Covid pandemic and high inventories,"" said K. Ravichandran, Senior Vice-President and Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.

""While record low prices are unlikely to sustain beyond the shock of the coronavirus, the surplus of LNG supply means prices will remain subdued. From an LNG aggregators perspective low spot prices could compress marketing margins on contracted long-term LNG as consumers would pressurise for reducing delivered prices,"" he added.

According to ICRA, low spot LNG prices are positive from a consumer perspective, however, due to the current low demand across different sectors, most production facilities are operating at moderate capacity utilisations and accordingly consumers which have long-term LNG procurement contracts are unable to exhaust the current contracted quantities of gas and take advantage of spot gas.

With ease in lockdown restrictions and recovery in demand, consumers would be in a position to benefit from low spot prices, it said.

In case of ultra low spot prices, a key beneficiary would be domestic city gas distribution (CGD) companies who are expected to roll out networks in a large number of geographical areas (GAs) and low spot gas prices could provide compelling economics to convert industrial and commercial consumers from alternate fuels, ICRA said.

Moreover, standalone LNG dispensing stations, on which greater regulatory clarity was received recently, could also benefit from demand fillip, it added.

Additionally, in an effort towards enabling gas market and fostering gas trading in the country, the Indian government launched a natural gas trading platform - Indian Gas Exchange (IGX) on June 15, 2020. To begin with, trading has started at the physical hubs at Hazira and Dahej in Gujarat and Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh. The exchange provides six market products such as daily, weekly, fortnightly etc. The contracts traded at IGX are for compulsory physical delivery and are non-transferable.

""While a gas trading exchange would provide efficient and competitive discovery of gas prices, there are several impediments to overcome such as low domestic production vis-a-vis demand, bulk of domestic gas governed by the modified Rangarajan formula, lack of pan India trunk pipeline infrastructure, distance bases transportation tariff regime, different taxation rates across states etc,"" it said.

By Chitranjan Kumar",ICRA says the fall in global gas prices is credit positive for domestic consumers. spot prices of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have declined to about $2 per million British thermal units. the report added that the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to drag the world GDP into 3% contraction. the report also said that crude oil prices have also declined precipitously due to slump in demand.,Negative
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-expected-to-report-slowest-job-growth-in-six-months-6188611.html,"U.S. employers likely hired the fewest workers in six months in November, hindered by a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases that, together with a lack of more government relief money, threatens to reverse the recovery from the pandemic recession.

The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday will only cover the first two weeks of November, when the current wave of coronavirus infections started. Infections, hospitalizations and death rates have sky-rocketed, leading some economists to anticipate a drop in employment in December or January as more jurisdictions impose restrictions on businesses and consumers shun crowded places like restaurants.

""The November employment report may be the last 'strong' employment report for a while until a vaccine is widely available,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""The labor market is showing increased signs of stress, which could manifest itself into smaller monthly hiring gains over the winter months.""

Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 469,000 jobs last month after rising by 638,000 in October, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would be the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and a fifth straight monthly deceleration in job gains, leaving employment 9.621 million jobs below its February peak.

It would be in line with reports on consumer spending, manufacturing and services industries that have suggested a slowdown in the recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression. Hiring peaked 4.781 million in June.

The United States is in the midst of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections. Nearly 200,000 new cases were reported on Wednesday and hospitalizations approached a record 100,000 patients, according to a Reuters tally of official data.

Republicans in Congress struck a more upbeat tone on Thursday during coronavirus aid talks as they pushed for a slim $500 billion measure that previously was rejected by Democrats who say more money is needed.

More than $3 trillion in government COVID-19 relief helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. The uncontrolled pandemic and lack of additional fiscal stimulus could result in the economy contracting in the first quarter of 2021.

""We are going to see another dip in employment sometime this winter and followed by a decline in GDP in the first quarter,"" said Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""Unlike the first wave, there is no massive government stimulus on the horizon to cushion the economy. Interest rates are already zero.""

DOWNSIDE BIAS

Job growth last month was likely held back by further departures of temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census. States and local governments are also expected to have shed more workers, leaving overall government payrolls to decline for a second straight month.

Retailers typically embark on seasonal hiring in November, a practice that has been upended by the pandemic. Economists expect this disruption could throw off the model that the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data.

Payrolls could surprise on the downside. The Institute for Supply Management reported this week its measure of factory employment contracted in November. The Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"" report showed employment rising in all districts on or before Nov. 20, but the U.S. central bank noted ""for most, the pace was slow, at best.""

The unemployment rate is forecast dipping to 6.8% from 6.9% in October. It, however, has been biased down by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" That will keep the focus on long-term unemployment and people working part-time for economic reasons.

Economists will also keep an eye on the share of women in the labor force. Industries that tend to employ women have been hard hit by the recession. Many women have also quit jobs to look after children as schools have moved to online learning.

The number of people out of work for more than six months surged by 1.2 million in October. There were 6.7 million part-time workers. The share of those permanently unemployed increased to 40.9% in October from 35.6% in the prior month.

""Long-term unemployment always rises in a downturn, but the increase in the share of long-term unemployed has been extraordinarily rapid in the pandemic recession,"" said Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ""This matters because people who have been unemployed for more than six months generally have a harder time being reemployed.""

Labor market slack is expected to have left wages barely rising in November. Average hourly earnings are forecast nudging up 0.1%, matching October's gain. The average workweek is seen steady at 34.8 hours. Slower job and wage growth would lead to weakness in a proxy for take-home pay.

""The slowing in income along with the lack of another fiscal stimulus package will constrain household income and spending going forward,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York.","nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 469,000 jobs last month. that would be the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in may. the united states is in the midst of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections. a lack of more government relief money could result in the economy contracting. a spokesman for the labor department says the report is ""very optimistic""",Negative

The Indian economy, despite all its inherent potential, is going through one of its leanest patches recently. Renowned global agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have slashed the country’s growth forecast in their publications. Today, the signs of an economic slowdown are all the more evident.

With the economic slowdown taking the center-stage, resulting in most investments turning red, investors are looking at ways to reverse fortunes and be optimistic.

Interestingly, our rituals, too, are all about keeping negativities at bay, being positive and Muhurat trading is just the beginning.

Positive sentiment on the horizon:

Muhurat trading is an auspicious slot on the day ‘Lakshmi Pujan’ on Diwali when markets open for an hour in the evening. Trading done during that particular period is believed to bring good luck, wealth and prosperity.

For individual and institutional investors, Muhurat trading presents an opportunity to carry out some trading as a token of auspicious buying. More than a means for booking profit, transactions are carried out with the hope of a profitable year ahead.

This year, BSE and NSE will conduct Muhurat trading on October 27 from 18:15 hrs to 19:15 hrs.

How to make the most of Muhurat trading?

As Muhurat trading is the mark of a new beginning, it’s the right time to take stock of your asset allocation and find out if it’s performing as per your liking, most importantly according to your financial goals. Note that with trading restricted to only an hour, Muhurat trading limits liquidity.

With little space to book profit, it is advisable to avoid day trading strategy during this special trading session. New investors looking to get started can make token investments to mark the auspicious occasion.

While doing so, don’t get swayed by the festive sentiments. Invest a small amount, ideally in large-cap scrips. If you are in a dilemma, you can take help from a certified financial planner.

To sum up:

Amid the domestic slowdown, international developments like political tension in the Middle East and the raging trade war between global powers are further expected to put pressure on the Indian economy.

As a response to the ongoing crisis, the concerned authorities have come up with several initiatives like concession in corporate tax, cut in the repo rate and linking of lending rate to external benchmarks for the efficient transfer of benefits of such cuts to the borrowers.

A boost in domestic investment holds the key to the revival of the spirits in the Indian financial markets. Also, paying homage to the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, there can’t be a better occasion than Muhurat Trading to get started.

India, with its highly developed regulatory infrastructure and policy machinery, has gone a long way to set up a competitive business environment. Tiding over the current economic slowdown calls for financial consolidation, of which Muhurat trading can be the perfect beginning.

In a fluid market scenario, a long- term investment strategy can help you leverage the power of compounding and benefit from the inflation-beating returns of equities.

Happy trading!

https://www.financialexpress.com/brandwagon/coronavirus-impact-how-broadcasters-are-dealing-with-content-shortfall/1918376/,"The television broadcast industry is taking a few creative liberties to deal with the lack of fresh content in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. While some broadcasters are developing theme-based edits of existing content, and bringing back iconic shows, others are resorting to reruns of popular shows, and testing the viability of using video conferencing tools to create content.

The Indian film and television industry had decided to halt shoots as a preventive measure until March 31. But the 21-day national lockdown has imposed a longer moratorium on the industry. With a content repository that could last only four weeks, most broadcasters had run out of fresh content by March end.

Riding on nostalgia

Bringing back old shows seems to be broadcasters’ best bet. Public broadcaster Doordarshan led the trend by bringing back iconic shows such as Ramayan, Circus, Byomkesh Bakshi and Shaktiman, among others. Viacom18 is airing reruns of its marquee non-fiction show Bigg Boss (Season 13) at 10 pm every day on Colors.

Zee TV is replacing its prime time shows Kumkum Bhagya and Kundali Bhagya with a few finite web series namely, Karrle Tu Bhi Mohabbat, Baarish, Kehne Ko Humsafar Hain, which were first streamed on ALTBalaji.

Prathyusha Agarwal, chief consumer officer, Zee Entertainment Enterprises, says, “We will also be creating fresh edits of existing shows. For instance, for &TV, we are developing edit-based, long episodes of shows such as Ek Mahanayak – Dr BR Ambedkar and Happu Ki Ultan Paltan.” The broadcaster is expected to tap into the originals library of its OTT platform, Zee5.

Additionally, broadcasters have turned some of their channels into free-to-air for a period of two months on all DTH and cable networks. Sony Pal, Star Utsav, Zee Anmol and Colors Rishtey are among the channels that are now available for free.

‘Home’ productions

The lockdown has led to a significant increase in television viewership, but most of the viewing is concentrated on news, movies and kids channels. The average time spent on GECs dropped by 5% in the week of March 14-21, as per the Broadcast Audience Research Council India, while news and kids channels have seen an increase of 17% and 11%, respectively, in average time spent.

In the US, where talk shows are immensely popular, broadcasters have begun creating broadcast-level content from the homes of the show hosts.

“While we are exploring all kinds of best practices from our counterparts in other markets, replicating the broadcast-from-home model will be tough in a scripted content heavy market like India,” says Deepak Dhar, founder and CEO, Banijay Asia.

Indian programming is dominated by scripted serials and non-fiction reality TV shows — both of which need a large set-up, crew and equipment.

Content creators in India are getting creative though. Cricketer Kevin Pietersen has been hosting interviews via Instagram Live with celebrities such as Indian batsman Rohit Sharma and member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor, while film reviewer Anupama Chopra is using Zoom video conferencing to interview Bollywood celebrities for YouTube channel Film Companion.

These formats are inspiring Indian television producers. Industry watchers say that sports channels are exploring options to replicate interviews via video conferencing and remote content creation formats.

Dhar says that while production has come to a grinding halt, teams are working on developing shows during this time. “This situation has shown us that we need to start evolving in the way we produce our content,” he says.

Ashish Pherwani, partner, media and entertainment leader, EY India, expects movies made on small budgets or movie producers struggling with cash flows to turn to early premieres on television. These too could help broadcasters who are content hungry right now.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

However, in his national address at 10 am on April 14 – the day the first lockdown was supposed to end – the Prime Minister only announced the extension of the lockdown, without much discussion on ways to restart economic activity, at least partially, in phases.

He, however, has been stressing on “jaan bhi, jahaan bhi” -- focusing on both life and livelihood -- as the mantra of the second lockdown against the “jaan hai toh jahan hai” – focusing only on saving lives -- mantra of the previous one.

The Prime Minister has promised to review the situation of the country five days from now on April 20 and basic economic activity may be allowed in certain pockets that prove to be safe from coronavirus infection, albeit with restrictions in place to ensure safety.

Eyes are glued on the Q4 economic growth data, as it includes the figures for one week of lockdown, which has the potential to drag the overall growth figure down. While ICRA estimates the Q4 GDP growth at 1.9 per cent, CRISIL estimates it at 0.5 per cent. SBI research has pegged the Q4 FY2019-20 GDP growth rate at 1.2 per cent. In today’s report, Care Ratings has put the most optimistic Q4 GDP growth at 3.6 per cent. A Reuters poll of economists has forecast India’s fourth quarter GDP growth at 2.1 per cent.

One of the major reasons for diverse predictions could be the absence of reliable headline numbers, making the predictions less precise. The difference in the predictions is so large that six out the 52 economists in the Reuters poll have also predicted a contraction in GDP in Q4. However, the GDP growth in full-year FY20 is unanimously believed to be in the range of 4 – 4.3 per cent. The impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on travel, tourism and hospitality, government expenditure compression amidst revenue shortfalls in March 2020, and subdued credit growth are expected to have adversely impacted service sector performance in Q4 FY2020, said Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist, ICRA.

Generally, business and economic activity shoots up in the last quarter as companies put more effort to meet their annual targets. However, the nationwide lockdown called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last week of March had put a major roadblock before the economy. The coronavirus pandemic is not the only trouble behind the country’s growth, instead, it is superimposed on the previous trouble of a longer-than-anticipated slowdown in the country. These two reasons clubbed together are responsible for the pessimistic growth predictions in the last quarter.

Meanwhile, the growth figures for the fourth quarter will also help in giving some clarity in establishing a base for the predictions of the first quarter when economic activity had almost come to a standstill in April and showed very limited momentum in May. Recently, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that the Indian economy will contract in the current fiscal.","the government is set to release GDP growth figures for the fiscal fourth quarter Jan-Mar tomorrow. while ICRA estimates the Q4 GDP growth at 1.9 per cent, CRISIL estimates it at 0.5 per cent. a Reuters poll of economists has forecast India’s fourth quarter GDP growth at 2.1 per cent. the impact of the coronavirus pandemic is not the only trouble behind the country’s growth.",Negative

For the past few months, we have been staring into the face of a grave danger, to the economy, society, as well as to the human race. What repercussions will ensue, none can fathom. None of us has witnessed a situation like the present one, where flights are grounded, ships remain docked at ports, cars silently parked at the houses, factories are mandatorily closed, and people, who have the good luck and luxury to afford it, remain locked in their own homes without protest.

Business as we know it, is not being conducted. While many employees in the services sector have the luxury of working from home, businesses based on manufacturing or requiring hands-on labour are suffering huge losses. While the efforts of our elected government in protecting the country from the deadly effects of the pandemic are laudatory, the resultant effects on our economy cannot be ignored.

The daily barrage of notifications coming everyday being issued by the government, either as a diktat or as an advisory, is making life tougher for these already struggling businesses.

While this unprecedented situation is beyond one's wildest imagination, the requirement by the state for all citizens to remain philanthropic i.e. neither lay off employees nor cut their salaries for an indefinite period of time appears to be impractical and misguided. Simply put, when one is prevented from operating their business indefinitely and earning profits, how can the state expect them to be philanthropic?

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

According to the latest press release dated May 1, 2020, the lockdown in our country has been extended for a further period of two weeks. The press release, once again, in predictable fashion, creates more ambiguity than clarity on facing the present situation.

It is noteworthy that while there is certain relaxation for e-commerce companies, activities in the demarcated Red Zone are permitted only to the extent of essential goods. One can imagine the problems arising from this declaration, when in many places, as in Delhi, the entire state has been declared a Red Zone. Further, the press release states that private offices can operate with upto 33 percent strength as per requirement, with remaining persons working from home.

I may be alone in this opinion, but the actual implementation of such clauses can only be imagined, not effectuated. Our well-intentioned though haphazard implementation of the lockdown begets the important legal question for businesses forced to sack its workers. What legal consequences will they face? The short answer is that our courts, which are overburdened, will face an explosion of resultant litigation by disgruntled employees and labor unions. Apart from unpaid employees, another major challenge facing businesses is their performance of contracts. Most contracts entered into nowadays contain standardised Force Majeure clauses, which may be rendered ineffectual in view of the present unimaginable situation. However, our judiciary is attempting to remain ahead of the problem.

As recently as last week, the High Court of Delhi in Halliburton Offshore Services Inc. v. Vedanta Ltd. & Anr., granted relief to the petitioner by allowing their claim of restriction on movement due to the present pandemic of COVID-19 to be in the nature of a Force Majeure event, and consequently, the respondent was restrained from invoking a bank guarantee against the petitioner.However, earlier this month, the Bombay High Court, on a strict reading of a Force Majeure clause contained in an agreement, disallowed a party from invoking the said clause in order to terminate a contract pertaining to the distribution of an essential commodity viz. steel, on grounds that the Force Majeure clause was applicable only to the Respondent, and further, that steel being an essential commodity, was not subject to the restriction imposed due to the nation-wide lockdown resulting from the pandemic.

Needless to state that although the aforementioned cases differ vastly in essence, the indefinite lockdown, that is undoubtedly required to stem the spread of COVID- 19, is dramatically increasing the liability of businesses.

Attributing the present situation of the novel coronavirus as an Act of God or a Force Majeure situation shall be dependent on the exact terms of a contract, and courts in general have been known to make strict interpretations of the same.

However, it is noteworthy that as of now, the Supreme Court has not been seized of such issues. If either of the aforementioned judgments were to be challenged before the apex court, it would undoubtedly provide a novel way of reading the same.In view of the numerous challenges faced by our citizenry, a question on the legality of such a lockdown too is constantly being raised. However, it is the judiciary which will finally decide if the actions of either the Legislature or the Executive were toeing the line or veering towards sheer arbitrariness.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/shelved-aramco-ipo-hits-at-heart-of-saudi-princes-reforms-2877821.html,"Saudi Arabia's decision to shelve what was billed as the biggest share sale ever is a major blow to the credibility of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman but there are other ways to finance reforms to strengthen the economy, bankers and investors say.

The initial public offering (IPO) of 5 percent of state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco was a centrepiece of the crown prince's plan to diversify the kingdom's economy beyond oil by raising $100 billion for investment in other sectors.

The 32 year old ruler, widely known as MbS, also promised that listing Saudi Aramco on international stock markets would help create a culture of openness in the secretive kingdom and make it more appealing to foreign investors.

The decision to shelve the IPO raises doubts about the management of the process as well as the broader reform agenda, sapping the momentum generated by Prince Mohammed's dramatic 2030 Vision announcement in 2016 that helped propel him to power in the world's top oil exporter.

""The problem is: the more it gets delayed and the more there's not clarity on why it's getting delayed and what the issues are, the more it undermines confidence,"" said James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS https://www.rsis.edu.sg).

""He's been very good at creating expectations but not as good at managing expectations,"" said Dorsey.

Industry sources told Reuters this week that both the international and domestic legs of the IPO had been postponed indefinitely. Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the government remained committed to conducting the IPO at an unspecified date in the future.

""The reform process has to be judged on its entirety and over a period of years but this will negatively affect perceptions of its credibility overall, considering that the IPO was promised in such high-profile terms,"" said Richard Segal, senior analyst at Manulife Asset Management in London.

VISION 2030

Prince Mohammed launched his Vision 2030 programme with promises to fundamentally transform Saudi Arabia's economy and open up its people's cloistered lifestyles. He has implemented a series of high-profile reforms, including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.

But those moves have been accompanied by a harsh crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen now in its fourth year.

The crown prince's increasingly aggressive stance towards arch-rival Iran and in relations with supposed friends such as Canada and Germany has unnerved allies and investors alike.

""The Aramco IPO was supposed to be an example of a new global level of transparency. Perhaps because there's so much going on and so little explained, it looks like they've gotten worse at transparency,"" said a former senior Western diplomat.

But some bankers said the reform programme was far bigger than the Aramco IPO and, despite the possible political fallout, many changes could still go ahead, or even accelerate, now that senior officials are no longer preoccupied by listing Aramco.

""The reality is there is a lot of other stuff that the authorities could do before doing this huge move of the Aramco IPO,"" said a senior banker whose institution pitched to help arrange the sale.

FDI DRIVE

Riyadh's circumstances have improved greatly since plans for the IPO were first announced in 2016.

Oil was about $35 a barrel at the time and the government was desperate for cash. Oil prices have more than doubled since and the state budget deficit has narrowed sharply, so Riyadh has more room to find other ways to finance projects.

MSCI https://www.msci.com and FTSE Russell http://www.ftserussell.com decided this year to add Saudi Arabia to their emerging market equity indexes, so even without the IPO the kingdom can expect an inflow of $20 billion or more of foreign funds next year.

Meanwhile, the authorities are proceeding, slowly, with other reforms to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).

In July, Riyadh published draft rules for partnerships between the state and private firms to build infrastructure. Last week, the kingdom's water utility said it was talking to international companies about involving them in water distribution and treatment.

In addition to Aramco, authorities have said they aim to sell another $200 billion worth of state assets in the coming years. While many analysts say this looks ambitious, freezing the Aramco IPO may clear the way for smaller sales to go ahead.

""The IPO always had important symbolic value but would not have affected the rest of the Saudi economy very much,"" said Steffen Hertog, associate professor at the London School Economics and Political Science http://www.lse.ac.uk and a leading scholar on Saudi Arabia.

""Challenges like private job creation for Saudis and improving the legal and regulatory environment for local and foreign investors are more important for kingdom's long-term economic health,"" he said.

SABIC SALE

While Prince Mohammed put the value of a 5 percent stake in Saudi Aramco at about $100 billion, analysts reckon the IPO would have only raised some $50 billion to $75 billion as the prince's valuation was over-optimistic.

The money would have gone to the government's Public Investment Fund (PIF), largely to fund projects creating jobs. With unemployment among Saudi citizens officially at a record 12.9 percent, finding ways to boost employment is seen as vital.

But even without the IPO, those projects could still go ahead because Aramco said in July it may buy a strategic stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) from PIF - potentially giving the fund as much money as the IPO.

At market prices, the sale of the PIF's entire 70 percent stake in SABIC to Saudi Aramco would raise about $70 billion.

If the PIF can create jobs, suspending the Aramco sale may even prove politically positive for Prince Mohammed because some Saudis were uncomfortable with the IPO.

""The average citizen saw it as a misguided sell-off of the national patrimony. Many Saudi royals worried it would expose their source of wealth and privilege,"" said Jim Krane, fellow for energy studies at Rice University's Baker Institute.

""So there is probably some level of relief in Saudi Arabia that the state is backing away from the plan.""",the initial public offering (IPO) of 5 percent of state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco was billed as the biggest share sale ever. the decision to shelve the IPO raises doubts about the management of the process and the broader reform agenda. both the international and domestic legs of the IPO have been postponed indefinitely.,Negative

https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/economics-vs-covid-19-the-question-of-how-to-get-cash-to-the-intended-recipients-is-not-as-straightforward/1916638/,"With the coronavirus devastating one economy after another, the economics profession—and thus the analytical underpinnings for sound policymaking and crisis management—is having to play catch-up. Of particular concern now are the economics of viral contagion, of fear, and of “circuit breakers”. The more that economic thinking advances to meet changing realities, the better will be the analysis that informs the policy response.

That response is set to be both novel and inevitably costly. Governments and central banks are pursuing unprecedented measures to mitigate the global downturn, lest a now-certain global recession gives way to a depression (already an uncomfortably high risk). As they do, we will likely see a further erosion of the distinction between mainstream economics in advanced economies and in developing economies.

Such a change is sorely needed. With overwhelming evidence of massive declines in consumption and production across countries, analysts in advanced economies must reckon, first and foremost, with a phenomenon that was hitherto familiar only to fragile/failed states and communities devastated by natural disasters: an economic sudden stop, together with the cascade of devastation that can follow from it. They will then face other challenges that are more familiar to developing countries.

Consider the nature of the pandemic economy. Regardless of their desire to spend, consumers are unable to do so, because they have been urged or ordered to stay home. And regardless of their willingness to sell, stores cannot reach their customers, and many are cut off from their suppliers.

The immediate priority, of course, is the public-health response, which calls for social distancing, self-isolation, and other measures that are fundamentally inconsistent with how modern economies are wired. As a result, there has been a rapid contraction of economic activity (and therefore economic wellbeing).

As for the severity and duration of the coming recession, all will depend on the success of the health-policy response, particularly on efforts to identify and contain the spread of the virus, treat the ill, and enhance immunity. While waiting for progress on these three fronts, fear and uncertainty will deepen, with adverse implications for financial stability and prospects for economic recovery.

When thrust out of our comfort zones in such a sudden and violent fashion, most of us will succumb to some degree of paralysis, overreaction, or both. Our tendency to panic lends itself to still deeper economic disruptions. As liquidity constraints kick in, market participants rush to cash out, selling not just what is desirable to sell, but whatever can feasibly be sold.

When this happens, the predictable result is high risk of wholesale financial liquidation, which, in the absence of smart emergency policy interventions, will threaten the functioning of markets. In the case of the current crisis, the risk that the financial system will reverse-infect the real economy and cause a depression is too big to ignore.

That brings us to the third analytical priority: the economics of circuit breakers. Here, the question is not just what emergency policy interventions can achieve, but also what lies beyond their reach, and when.

To be sure, given that simultaneous economic and financial deleveraging would have disastrous implications for societal wellbeing, the current moment clearly demands a “whatever-it-takes”, “all-in”, and “whole-of-government” policy approach. The immediate priority is to establish circuit breakers that can limit the scope of dangerous economic and financial feedback loops. This effort is being led by central banks, but also involves fiscal authorities and others.

But there will be tricky tradeoffs to navigate. For example, there is significant momentum behind proposals for cash transfers and interest-free lending to protect vulnerable segments of the population, keep companies afloat, and safeguard strategic economic sectors. Rightly so. The idea is to minimize the risk that liquidity problems will become solvency problems. And yet, a cash- and loan-infusion program will face immediate implementation challenges. Aside from the unintended consequences and collateral damage that come with all blanket measures, flooding the entire system in today’s crisis would require the creation of new distribution channels. The question of how to get cash to the intended recipients is not as straightforward as it seems.

There are even more difficulties when it comes to implementing direct bailout programs, which have become increasingly likely. Far from being outliers, airlines, cruise lines, and other severely affected sectors are leading indicators of what is yet to come. From multinational industrial companies to family restaurants and other small businesses, the line for government bailouts will be very long.

Without clearly stated principles as to why, how, when, and under what terms government assistance will be offered, there is a high chance that the bailouts will be politicized, ill-designed, and co-opted by special interests. That would undermine the exit strategies for putting firms back on their own feet, and risk repeating the post-2008 experience, when the crisis was brought to heel but without laying the groundwork for strong, sustainable, and inclusive growth thereafter.

Given how extensive government interventions are likely to be this time around, it is critical that policymakers also recognize the limits of their interventions. No tax rebate, low-interest loan, or cheap mortgage refinancing will convince people to resume normal economic activity if they still fear for their own health. Besides, as long as the public-health emphasis is on social distancing as a means of quashing community transmission, governments won’t want people venturing out anyway.

All the issues raised above are ripe for more economic research. In pursuing these avenues of inquiry, many researchers in advanced economies will find themselves inevitably rubbing up against development economics—from crisis management and market failures to overcoming adjustment fatigue and putting in place better foundations for structurally sound, sustainable, and inclusive growth. Insofar as they adopt insights from both domains, economics will be better for it. Until recently, the profession has been far too resistant to eliminating artificial distinctions, let alone embracing a more multidisciplinary approach.

These self-imposed limits have persisted despite abundant evidence that, particularly since the early 2000s, advanced economies are saddled with structural and institutional impediments that have stifled growth in a manner quite familiar to developing economies. In the years since the GFC (2008), these problems have deepened political and societal divisions, undermined financial stability, and made it more difficult to confront the unprecedented crisis that is now knocking down our door.

While the Berkshire Hathaway’s three biggest ventures including the BNFS railroad, insurance, and the energy business have been in a “reasonably decent” situation but its other businesses (such as the home furnishing store chain Nebraska Furniture Mart and chocolate and candy maker See’s Candies) have been “effectively shut down,” he said, to contain the virus spread.

As the company accelerated efforts against Covid in the second half of March and April, “most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe,” Hathaway said in its Q1 2020 earnings report. Its railroad, utilities and energy, insurance and certain of its manufacturing, distribution and service businesses “have slowed considerably in April.” Buffett told his shareholders that the company has sold around $6.5 billion of stock in April when it pared around 10 per cent stakes in the country’s four largest airlines – America, United, Delta and Southwest Airlines. The billion investor said he made an “understandable mistake” in valuing their stock noting that the airline sector has been “really hurt by a forced shutdown” due to the virus.

Berkshire Hathaway, which reported $137 billion cash in hand, hasn’t made any big investment deal since 2016 when it bought the industrial goods and metal fabrication company Precision Castparts for $37 billion. Buffett said that’s because he hasn’t come across a company “attractive” enough for the deal. “We have not done anything, because we don’t see anything that attractive to do.” However, the company is “willing to do something very big,” he said.","the company reported a 6% increase to $5.87 billion in the first quarter of 2020 amid the outbreak.

Under a certain clause, telecom companies were required to charge a minimum of 50 paisa per SMS above the limit of 100 SMS per SIM per day to avoid commercial bulk texts. “The deletion of Schedule XIII thus implies another step of TRAI in doing away with the tariff regulation and strengthening the regime of tariff regime forbearance,” TRAI said in its latest notification. However, after the removal of this clause, companies now have a free hand in deciding the charges for such bulk messages, PTI reported an official as saying.

“It was felt that tariff regulation which has the potential of adversely affecting the interests of genuine non-commercial bulk users of SMS is no longer required and therefore can be removed,” TRAI said. The Schedule XIII of the Telecommunications Tariff Order was introduced in 2012.

Meanwhile, Indian telecom operators are in for a pleasant surprise by FY25 as their revenues are likely to be doubled by the time period. India has entered into a “tariff discipline phase”, which means that companies such as Vodafone-Idea, Reliance Jio, and Bharti Airtel will enjoy higher ARPU (average revenue per user). “A comparative analysis of over 25 markets indicates that mobile revenues/ARPUs in India could double over FY20-25 to USD 38 billion,” a Jefferies report said on Monday.

Frontline indices fell more than 1.5 percent Friday and the broader markets crashed over 4 percent while on the sectoral front, Nifty Bank lost more than 500 points.

Major worry in market is the correction in midcaps that started even before the Budget and continued today with volumes on the buy side shrinking. Margin calls triggered in the morning led to sell-off in frontline stocks as well.

More than long term capital gains (LTCG) tax of 10 percent reintroduced in the Budget, introduction of a tax on distributed income by equity oriented mutual fund at the rate of 10 percent bothered investors, experts suggest.

A likely compression of price earnings, and hike in interest rates that may hit margin and finance cost for companies with debt on books also hit sentiment.

""One can ascribe this fall to LTCG, revenue deficit shortfall, political uncertainty as people get worried post Rajasthan bypolls where BJP lost the game,"" Ajay Srivastava of Dimensions Corporate Financial Services told CNBC-TV18.

""All in all the government is facing biggest headwinds and people are saying that true cost of demonetisation is coming to the fore. The government has no revenues to meet its political goals, which all I think bothering most to investors who are saying will this continue like this.""

In this market, he said apart from economic uncertainties, political issues will also come to the fore and will become more relevant. Srivastava was thinking of happening somewhere in June-July, but it is happening now.

""MF inflows which were guaranteed with 10 percent distribution tax and were giving dividend every month, it was tax free, but now suddenly everyone is sitting with tax authorities. Now what is bothering investors is will this investment flow keep coming to MFs as now there are large segments go under tax hammer compared to earlier set up. It is not about paying tax but dealing with the tax. So all in all LTCG is not hurting sentiment but 10 percent tax on mutual funds is bothering most to investors now,"" he explained the major reason of worry.

Dipan Mehta, Member BSE & NSE said in an interview to CNBC-TV18 that more than LTCG, the fear in the market is about likely rise in interest rates and the process of compression of price earnings multiples but there is not threat to earnings and earnings remain intact.

Prior to Budget, market was factoring stable interest and justifying higher PE multiples, that equation may be turnaround completely, we are seeing that may be equity may not be the best asset class and we may get decent returns in fixed income as well.

On the whole, the companies which have huge debt on books wil have pressure on interest rates and margins, Mehta said.

Hemang Jani, Head Equity Sales & Advisory, Sharekhan feels the broad market is reacting negatively to the excessive focus on rural and social schemes and the return of LTCG tax.

There is stock specific pressure due to unwinding of positions in high beta stocks and the market will take few days to absorb these proposals, he said.

Srivastava feels the midcap crisis should get stabilised soon. People can hold on to stocks, don't sell out at this point of time, he advised.

http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/sbi-sees-bad-loan-provisions-as-biggest-challenge/1027307/,"State Bank of India, the nation’s largest lender, sees provisioning for soured debt as the biggest challenge for the South Asian nation’s banking system even as credit growth is reviving from a three-decade low.

“Whatever process we resort to for the resolution of non-performing assets there will be a gap in the provisioning,” Chairman Rajnish Kumar said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday. “That is precisely where the support from the government is required. For the banking system to come out of the problem we have to provide for those loan losses that have been incurred.”

Kumar is at the forefront of helping clean up the worst soured-debt ratio among the world’s biggest economies. Overdue loans have dragged economic growth to the lowest since 2014, piling pressure on the government to revive activity before elections next year.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has pledged to inject $33 billion of fresh capital into struggling state-run banks — including SBI — and the Reserve Bank of India has asked commercial lenders to resolve bad loans at 40 of the biggest defaulters within a year. Policy makers are betting these moves will boost loan growth from a 30-year low.

Rate Outlook

“Banks need to recapitalize, write down bad debts and be in a stronger position first,” Kumar said, referring to the government’s plan to merge some state-run banks. “We need to create a few more large banks in the country as the gap between SBI and others is very wide.”

State Bank, which accounts for more than a fifth of India’s banking assets, broke into the ranks of the world’s top 50 lenders in April after it merged with five smaller units and Bharatiya Mahila Bank Ltd. The lender is set to report earnings for the December quarter next month.

Under Kumar, the lender aims to focus on expanding loans to consumers as well as small and medium-sized enterprises. His task will probably become tougher as monetary conditions tighten. India’s inflation has breached the central bank’s target, increasing the odds the RBI will raise borrowing costs sooner than expected. It’s due to review policy Feb. 7.

“Our sense is that going forward the inflation numbers will stabilize and at least for the next six months there will not be an up-move in terms of the central bank’s policy rates and government bond yields,” Kumar said.","the nation's largest lender sees provisioning for soured debt as the biggest challenge for the south Asian nation's banking system. chairman Rajnish Kumar is at the forefront of helping clean up the worst soured-debt ratio among the world's biggest economies. overdue loans have dragged economic growth to the lowest since 2014, piling pressure on the government to revive activity before elections next year.",Negative

The last such drop was seen in Q1 2017, post demonetisation.Office absorption in Q1 2020 was backed by strong pre-commitment levels in new completions during the quarter. The quarter witnessed a net absorption of 8.6 mn sq ft of Grade A office space , out of which pre-commitments accounted for 4.9 mn sq ft, said JLL The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic became more apparent in March as most businesses defer their real estate decisions. IT- ITeS (56%) as well as co-working (13%) occupiers drove leasing activity during the quarter.“The evolving COVID-19 crisis is prompting corporates to re-evaluate their commercial real estate strategies, with a focus on enhancing resilience measures. There will be a greater emphasis on cost management, employee wellbeing and sustainability, and the adoption of flexible working practices as resilience practices ramp up,” said Ramesh Nair, CEO & Country Head, JLL.Furthermore, construction activity and the process of obtaining requisite approvals from the government also slowed down in the beginning of March, in line with growing concerns of the impact of COVID-19. “New completions were recorded at 8.6 mn sq ft in Q1 2020, a fall of 40% Y-o-Y from levels observed in Q1 2019 and representing the second largest dip witnessed in new completions in the last five years. Post demonetisation, new completions dropped to less than 20% of that seen in Q1 2016,” adds the report.The three larger markets of Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi NCR accounted for nearly 75% of the net absorption in Q1 2020, despite the overall decline in the overall market. Net absorption in Mumbai and Chennai more than doubled in Q1 2020 as compared to Q1 2019, led by strong leasing activity in the first two months by IT/ITeS occupiers.”The strong leasing momentum of 2019 continued in the first two months of 2020 before the pandemic impacted the Indian market in March. Several leasing deals in the final stages of negotiation were deferred as the office market witnessed a net absorption decline of 30% y-o-y. New completions also saw a fall of 40% y-o-y during Q1 2020. Several office assets in the final stages of completion were stuck owing to delays in obtaining requisite approvals from the government authorities,” said Samantak Das, Executive Director and Head of Research, REIS, JLL.The consultancy firm said that over the next few months, leasing is expected to be mainly driven by renewals and consolidation activity. With fresh take up of spaces likely to be limited, landlords might have to sit on locked in capital (completed buildings) for a relatively longer time period. Business continuity plans and remote working strategies have been successful. Hence, future demand from occupiers is likely to take into account the need for flexible workspace.","net absorption of office spaces in india in Q1 2020 witnessed a decline of 30% from the peak observed in Q1 2019. the last such drop was seen in Q1 2017, post demonetisation. the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic became more apparent in march as most businesses defer their real estate decisions. the three larger markets of Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi NCR accounted for nearly 75% of the net absorption in the quarter.",Negative
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/franklin-templeton-fund-closure-an-eye-opener-for-rbi-umesh-mehta-5185841.html,"Franklin Templeton’s fund closure is an eye-opener for the RBI that its liquidity efforts are either insufficient or are not effective in de-freezing the liquidity crisis, Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities, says in an interview to Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q) Franklin Templeton has shut down six credit risk strategy debt funds. This is the second casualty of the coronavirus outbreak after IndiaNivesh. Do you think investors will again lose faith like they did after the 2008 financial crisis?

A) Investors currently are in a state of fear and shock but during such a crisis causalities do happen and the credit risk of debt funds is a natural extension of a liquidity crisis.

Therefore, this is not a systematic crisis but is considered a part and parcel of such downtrends. However, it is an eye-opener for the RBI that despite its liquidity efforts, these measures are either insufficient or are not effective in de-freezing the liquidity crisis.

Hopefully, now that the credit risk debt fund crisis has occurred, it is expected that things will be taken care of at the regulatory end.

Q) What can the government do to mitigate the credit crisis that led to the winding down of Franklin Templeton schemes?

A) There is a lot that the government needs to do to bring back confidence and trust in the economy but all wishes cannot be granted.

The minimum -- the government should take on the risk of credit defaults of SMEs and MSMEs such that they are able to access fresh line of credit to revive their depleting businesses.

This is similar to the government having credited a sum of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 a month for three months for farmers and women in their Jan Dhan accounts directly.

Q) A volatile week for Indian markets but the Nifty managed to hold on to 9,000, supported by some positive global cues and expectations of a stimulus package. But it looks like 9,300 is a crucial resistance level for the Nifty50. What are your views on the market?

A) 9,300 is indeed a crucial level for the Nifty and acts as strong resistance as it is nothing but 38 percent retracement of the market’s recent fall as per Fibonacci’s retracement levels.

Such levels assume importance because even international markets are hovering around similar retracement levels. Unless we see substantial improvement in the situation on both – the COVID-19 front and the business resumption front-- we believe 9,300 will be a strong resistance level.

Q) What are the important data points and levels to watch out for in the coming week?

A) 9300-9400 levels will be a cluster of strong resistance for the market and any increase in VIX may resume the downtrend in the bourses.

Nonetheless, astute government stimulus and important policy decisions to kick start the economic engine, which is currently at standstill, are expected to be key pointers for the markets going ahead.

Q) Small and midcaps underperformed and we are seeing some stress in the broader market space. Has falling GDP growth rate made things worse for some stocks? What should investors do if they have small & midcap-focused portfolios?

A) Amid continued deterioration in the economy, small and midcaps have really been hit hard. But, this is a matter of reality, those who are strong and large will lead as and when things start to look brighter.

It is also feared that some small and midcap companies might go into oblivion in dark times like these. Some of them may even destroy complete values.

Therefore, as a prudent approach, one may consider switching from such funds to largecap frontline funds. This would certainly be a difficult decision but would pay off in the long run.

Q) There is so much volatility. Are there any all-weather stocks that one can look at?

A) Assuming that someone really wants to remain invested in equities at all times, then FMCG as a sector should act as a defensive play, although that sector, too, might see some profit booking if the market goes deeper into a recessionary spiral.

Ideally, it is said that in bull markets equity is the king and in uncertain times cash is the king. One has to remain invested selectively but at the same time keep liquidity in order to take advantage of further falls.

Investors will have a long time to pick and select stocks for investment. Beaten down sectors and stocks ideally should outperform markets once the bull market resumes and defensives would then underperform.

Chennai/Mumbai: The Tata Group may eliminate jobs at some of its businesses to save fixed costs as it grapples with falling profits due to the coronavirus pandemic, and global economic projections pointing to a challenging time ahead.The pandemic had led to a suspension of the conglomerate’s several businesses — including aerospace, automotive and aviation — depressing its earnings in key markets across the world. The conglomerate has already made moves to cut contract workers engaged in manufacturing and other functions at its various facilities, including at Tata Motors and its UK arm Jaguar Land Rover.Tata Motors, after sinking Rs 9,864 crore into the red in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, said “there are widespread opportunities to cut costs across the organisation and all actions will be taken with prudence”, without getting into specifics. The flagship of the Tata Group has initiated a cash improvement programme of Rs 6,000 crore and 5 billion pounds at its India and UK units. Sources said the company plans to axe jobs at various levels in the domestic business. The labour union at Tata Steel’s Netherlands unit said the management planned to slash 1,000 of the 9,000 jobs at the site to improve the profitability of the metal producer.The senior leadership at the group’s several businesses, including Indian Hotels Company (which runs the Taj chain), has already taken a cut in remuneration as part of a broader restructuring plan.

https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/coronavirus-in-us-covid-19-confirmed-cases-reach-half-a-million-22000-dead/story/400826.html,"Americans spent a glum Easter Sunday largely confined to their homes by the still-raging coronavirus pandemic as the U.S. death toll neared 22,000, with more than half a million confirmed cases nationwide.

With 42 states imposing strict stay-at-home orders most churches were shuttered, although many erected crosses outside or even offered drive-through services conducted by priests, pastors or ministers wearing latex gloves and surgical masks.

Other Americans turned to online church services to mark the holiest day in the Christian calendar. In Louisiana, the evangelical Life Tabernacle megachurch near Baton Rouge defied local government orders to shut down, holding its Easter Sunday service as planned, said Reverend Tony Spell.

""Our rights come from our creator, not from a governing body,"" Spell told Reuters, adding people traveled from across the region to attend.

In some states, attempts by authorities to clamp down on Easter services have sparked legal battles over the rights of government to prevent Americans from attending church, even under pandemic conditions.

On Saturday, the Kansas Supreme Court upheld an executive order barring more than 10 people from gathering for religious and funeral services. The decision, a victory for Democratic Governor Laura Kelly, followed an attempt by a Republican-led legislative body to overturn the order.

The United States, with the world's third-largest population, has recorded more fatalities from COVID-19 than any other country, nearly 22,000 as of Sunday evening according to a Reuters tally.

Roughly 2,000 deaths a day were reported for the last four days in a row, the largest number in and around New York City. Even that is viewed as understated, as New York is still figuring out how best to include a surge in deaths at home in its official statistics. As the death toll has mounted, President Donald Trump mulled when the country might begin to see a return to normality.

Trump Eyes May 1

The sweeping restrictions on non-essential movement now applied to most Americans have damaged the economy, taken a painful toll on commerce and raised questions over how long business closures and travel curbs can be sustained. The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits in the last three weeks surpassed 16 million.

The Trump administration sees May 1 as a potential date for easing the restrictions, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, said on Sunday. But he cautioned that it was still too early to say whether that goal would be met.

""We see light at the end of the tunnel,"" Hahn told ABC's ""This Week,"" adding, ""Public safety and the welfare of the American people has to come first. That has to ultimately drive these decisions.""

In the latest sign of the disruption wrought by the disease, one of the nation's largest pork processing plants was shuttered after workers fell ill, and its owner warned the country was moving ""perilously close to the edge"" in supplies for grocers.

""It is impossible to keep our grocery stores stocked if our plants are not running,"" Ken Sullivan, chief executive of Smithfield Foods, said in a statement on Sunday.

Dozens of workers at a beef production plant in Greeley, Colorado, have tested positive for COVID-19, according to its owner, meatpacking company JBS USA. The union representing workers at the plant said two employees have died.

In recent days, public health experts and some governors have pointed to some hopeful signs that the worst of the pandemic might be past.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top U.S. infectious disease expert, said he was cautiously optimistic and pointed to the New York metropolitan area, which had its highest daily death toll last week but also saw a decrease in hospitalizations, intensive care admissions and the need to intubate critically ill patients.

""Once you turn that corner, hopefully you'll see a very sharp decline and then you can start thinking about how we can keep it that way,"" Fauci told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""If all of a sudden we decide 'OK, it's May whatever,' and we just turn the switch on, that could be a real problem.""

Fauci and other public health experts say widespread testing will be key to efforts to reopen the economy, including antibody tests to find out who has already had the disease and could be safe to return to work.

New government data shows a summer surge in infections if stay-at-home orders are lifted after only 30 days, according to projections first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by a Department of Homeland Security official.

https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/coronavirus-pandemic-impact-exports-collapse-by-35-in-march-more-pains-in-sight/1929678/,"Merchandise exports crashed by almost 35% year-on-year in March to $21.4 billion, the sharpest monthly decline in at least three decades since liberalisation, and imports plunged by 28.7%, as the COVID-19 outbreak and a consequent lockdown since March 24 wrought havoc on external trade. Trade deficit narrowed to a 13-month low of $9.75 billion in March.

With close to a half of their orders cancelled now and the nation-wide lockdown extended up to May 3, exporters warn of a much steeper decline in both outbound and inbound shipments in April. In any case, key markets — the US and the EU — have been badly hit by the pandemic.

Merchandise exports, which had already contracted by 1.5% y-o-y up to February, ended the last fiscal with a 4.8% fall to $314.3 billion. Imports dropped 9.1% in FY20 to $467.2 billion.

Barring iron ore, exports of all the 30 major groups witnessed a contraction last month. The sharpest slide was witnessed in oil meals (70%), followed by meat, dairy and poultry (45.5%), engineering goods (42.3%), gems and jewellery (41%), leather and leather products (36.8%), plastics and linoleum (35.7%), garments (-34.9%) and carpets (34.7%). Petroleum product exports dropped 31.1%, partly due to a crash in prices, while rice exports declined by 28.3% and electronics goods by 21.5%.

Core (non-oil and non-gold) exports dropped by 34.2% in March, while such imports fell by 29.1%.

Overseas buyers are using the crisis to renegotiate contract terms and seek a cut in product prices. Domestic manufacturing units are shut and logistics chains in tatters, even though ports are functioning. However, with the government allowing some units to start operations, the situation is expected to ease in May, say exporters. But external headwinds and subdued domestic manufacturing continue to hurt exports. Even a depreciation of the rupee against the dollar is hardly any consolation, as the currencies of some of the competitors like Indonesia and Malaysia have weakened at a faster pace.

Most of the top 25 destinations for engineering goods exports are facing a lockdown. These 25 markets together accounted for $53 billion of the $71 billion worth outbound shipments of these products in the April-February period, said Ravi Sehgal, chairman of EEPC India.

The Federation of Indian Export Organisations president Sharad Kumar Saraf cited the cancellation of over 50% of orders, gloomy forecast, major job losses and rising NPAs amongst exporting units to urge the government to immediately announce a relief package for exports. “COVID-19 interest-free working capital term loan to exporters to cover the cost of wages, rental and utilities, EPF and ESIC waiver for 3 months from March to May 2020 and extension of pre- and post-shipment credit by 90-180 days on their maturity are the much needed steps to help the exporting community during such difficult and testing times,” he said.",exports fell by almost 35% year-on-year in march to $21.4 billion. imports plunged by 28.7% as COVID-19 outbreak wrought havoc on trade. trade deficit narrowed to a 13-month low of $9.75 billion in march. exporters warn of steeper decline in both outbound and inbound shipments.,Negative
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/with-an-eye-on-faltering-rupee-rbi-expected-to-raise-rates-next-week-2987481.html,"The Reserve Bank of India is likely to raise interest rates in early October, despite relatively tame inflation, to prop up a retreating rupee, according to a Reuters poll of economists who also trimmed their near-term growth forecasts.

In an abrupt change from the last survey conducted two months ago, which predicted rates would stay on hold until this quarter next year, two-thirds of 61 economists polled September 19-25 said the RBI would lift the repo rate at least once by year-end.

Slightly over half said RBI Governor Urjit Patel and the Monetary Policy Committee would deliver a 25-basis-point rise to 6.75 percent at the October 5 policy meeting, with one economist calling for a 50-basis-point rise.

The predicted rate hike would be the RBI's third this year, having lifted borrowing costs in June and August. The US Federal Reserve is forecast to raise rates this week - its third this year - according a separate Reuters poll.

For many analysts, the retreating Indian rupee, which has tumbled nearly 15 percent since the start of the year and is the worst-performing major Asian currency, is likely of concern to policymakers.

On Tuesday the rupee, hit recently by growing credit concerns engulfing non-banking financial companies, was trading at 72.68 to the dollar.

The finance ministry also wants RBI to boost liquidity.

""For the RBI, I think it becomes necessary to provide a policy response. The question was only of timing,"" said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS in Singapore.

""Some would say it (rate hike) could have come sooner ... it probably would have been a bit more beneficial. But better now than never.""

If the RBI does raise rates, it would be the latest in a series of emerging market central banks that have been pressured into tightening policy in response to a tumbling currency.

Fortunately for the RBI, the economy is doing well. The Indian economy is forecast to expand by an annual rate of more than 7 percent every quarter for the next two years, although slower than the surprise 8.2 percent rate clocked last quarter.

This means that India will remain the world's fastest growing major economy, but economists have chopped forecasts somewhat for coming quarters.

""Although the high growth rate in Q2 might be partly attributed to favourable base effects ... the underlying dynamics of the Indian economy shows that virtually all high-frequency data is flashing green,"" said Hugo Erken, senior economist at Rabobank.

Prices of crude oil - the country's biggest import have surged by over 20 percent this year. That in turn has swollen the current account gap to 1.9 percent of GDP, swinging to deficit from a small surplus of 0.7 percent a year ago.

That gap is forecast to widen further to 2.8 percent of GDP by the fiscal year ending in March 2019, before easing slightly to 2.5 percent in 2019-20.

Just over half of 49 respondents who answered an additional question said the biggest economic risk over the coming year was higher fuel prices.

The escalating US-China trade war has not had a major impact on India so far but has spurred on a broad selloff in emerging market assets since the beginning of this year.

The sharp fall in the rupee has not stirred much worry about inflation, however, which was just under 3.7 percent in August, slightly below the 4 percent where the RBI prefers it to be.

It is expected to average 4.1 percent this quarter and next, but rise to 5 percent by the middle of 2019 - significantly lower than the predictions in the last poll two months ago.

Economists were almost evenly split on whether a weaker rupee posed the biggest upside risk to inflation, with 26 of 51 respondents saying it was.

But even if the RBI raises rates on October 4, it will still struggle to keep up with the Fed, which is expected to keep tighten policy well into next year.

""The RBI will have to do more, though that looks unlikely on the grounds of on-target inflation and stress in the financial sector,"" Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING, wrote in a research note.",two-thirds of economists polled say RBI will raise rates in early October. rupee has tumbled nearly 15 percent since start of year. rupee is worst-performing major Asian currency.

People may travel less now that they have discovered how much they can get done from home. Or they may commute more by car to avoid jostling with others on crowded buses and trains.

The auto industry was bracing for a brutal year even before the coronavirus idled factories, closed dealerships and sent sales into a free fall. Now, things are about to get really Darwinian: The industry is expected to realign in ways that could have a profound effect on the eight million people worldwide who work for vehicle manufacturers.

It took almost a decade for car sales in the European Union to recover from the recession that began in 2008. The US market took about five years to bounce back, but sales have been flat since 2015. Explosive growth in China initially helped compensate, but the market has been in decline since 2018. As Volkswagen, Daimler, Fiat Chrysler and other companies slowly restart their assembly lines, people who work in the car business are beginning to ponder what the repercussions of this crisis will be.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

“We shouldn’t be too optimistic and expect that in 2021 everything is going to go back to normal as if nothing happened,” Ola Källenius, the Chief Executive of Daimler, told reporters during a recent conference call. The pandemic, he said, “will probably have a huge effect on the economy and we have to prepare.”

Here’s a look at what to expect.

Factory closures and labour strifeAutomakers worldwide had at least 20 percent more factory capacity than they needed before the coronavirus hit, analysts say. That idle manufacturing space cost them money without producing any profit. As sales plummet further, shutting down underused plants may be a matter of survival.

“Some of those big plants in Europe are going to really struggle,” said Peter Wells, Director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School in Wales. The going will be especially tough for the companies that make smaller cars, which tend to be less profitable, like Fiat, Renault or Volkswagen’s SEAT brand.

In Europe, it’s impossible to close a factory without labour strife and political resistance because so many jobs are at stake. Severance payments to workers and other costs can make it as expensive to shutter a plant as it is to build one.

“It’s about the politics more than the economics,” Wells said.

In an example of the kind of fights that may lie ahead, workers shut down a Nissan plant in Barcelona only two days after it opened in early May, demanding that the Japanese company commit to maintaining its presence in Spain.

Electric cars could come sooner (maybe)Sales of electric cars have been surprisingly resilient even as lockdowns gutted sales of gasoline and diesel powered vehicles.

In March, as much of Europe went into lockdown, car sales on the continent fell by more than half. But registrations of battery-powered cars surged 23 percent, according to Matthias Schmidt, an analyst in Berlin who tracks the industry.

In April, lockdowns caught up with electric cars, too, and their sales fell 31 percent, according to Schmidt’s estimate. But that was nothing compared with the total European car market, which plummeted 80 percent.

It is not clear whether the surge in electric car sales is a trend or a quirk. Many of the electric vehicles registered early this year had been ordered earlier, Schmidt said. Carmakers may have taken their time delivering cars that were bought in 2019 so the vehicles would help meet stricter European Union limits on carbon dioxide emissions that took effect in 2020.

Carmakers may not be as motivated to sell electric cars in coming months. They will be tempted to instead push SUVs, which generate far greater profits and are easier to sell now that fuel prices have plunged.

Much will depend on government incentives and regulations. Europe and China are doing more to promote electric cars than the United States under the Trump administration. Battery-powered cars are still much more expensive than gasoline vehicles. In a recession, fewer people may be able to afford them without subsidies.

An opening for startupsTurmoil in the market could be good for electric car startups like Byton and Lucid, which have proliferated after Tesla showed it was possible to challenge the traditional carmakers. The startups have a chance to attack the market while the established companies are struggling.

“The spaces in the market might open up a bit,” Wells said. “Once the fractures start to emerge, things start to happen.”

For other challengers, the pandemic has been a huge setback. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, which threatened to make car ownership obsolete for urban residents, have suffered because everyone is staying home. The Silicon Valley companies that promised self-driving cars by 2020 are still years away, and the pandemic is interfering with the human road testing they need to perfect their technology.

Get ’em while they’re cheapFew sectors get less love from investors than the old-line carmakers. Shares in Renault, for example, have fallen 70 percent in the last year, and the stock market values the company at just 5.7 billion euro, or $6.2 billion. (Billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Michael Bloomberg and Elon Musk are worth far more as individuals than Renault with its 180,000 workers and sales of 3.8 million cars last year.)

There may be one group of investors willing to overlook the high risk and meagre profits of car making. Chinese investors could see rock-bottom valuations as an opportunity to get a foothold on the continent.

Geely Holding, a carmaker based in Hangzhou, set a precedent when it bought Volvo Cars from Ford in 2010. Geely also own 8 percent of Volvo AB, a Swedish truck maker that is separate from the car company. Geely’s Chairman, Li Shufu, owns almost 10 percent of Daimler. The Chinese automaker BAIC Group owns another 5 percent of Daimler.

Further incursions by Chinese investors are certain to meet political resistance. Germany is expected to pass legislation making it easier to block foreign acquisitions. France has passed similar legislation, and has significant sway over Renault because it owns 15 percent of the shares.

But foreign investment might be welcome if it helps preserve jobs. Geely has revived Volvo Cars and the region around its home base in Goteborg, Sweden.

Pair up or perishCarmakers will face even more pressure to spread around the cost of developing electric cars and other new technologies. Existing partnerships, such as the one between Volkswagen and Ford Motor to develop autonomous driving software, could be expanded.

“It’s pretty likely that we will see former enemies or former competitors start to team up with each other,” said Axel Schmidt, a Senior Managing Director at the consulting firm Accenture who focuses on the auto industry.

These alliances, though crucial, are tough to manage. Renault has struggled to overcome tensions with its longtime partner, Nissan.

Rethinking globalisationThe pandemic exposed just how interconnected the world is and how a factory closure in one part of the world can shut down an assembly line in a different hemisphere.

“What we are all learning, and I talk to a lot of managers and CEOs in Germany, is that we all have to rethink our logistics and supply chains,” said Olaf Berlien, Chief Executive of Osram, a German maker of lighting products for autos and other uses.

“Because of the price pressure that we are all under, we took the cheapest provider wherever in the world it might have been,” Berlien said. “We undervalued the provider who was just around the corner.”

Others are not so sure that carmakers will be more willing to buy local. Källenius of Daimler said supply chains were already built to withstand disruption and had stood up well during the crisis. Not a single Mercedes went unbuilt because of a supply chain problem, he said.

“I wouldn’t come too quickly to the conclusion that we have to regionalise supply chains,” Källenius said. “The globalisation that we have achieved in the last 20 years has led to enormous productivity gains. I would see it as a mistake to back away from that.”

https://www.livemint.com/news/india/how-china-fear-hits-indian-traders-11607264530187.html,"After dealing in the import of fancy goods and hair accessories from Ningbo—an industrial hub south of Shanghai in China—for several years, Mumbai-based trader Amit Shah has decided to call it quits.

“Suddenly, there are too many restrictions on imports. There’s no clarity. To make things worse, the domestic market is yet to pick up after the pandemic and the (subsequent) economic slowdown. Meanwhile, container freight rates have gone through the roof. There is no option for me but to down the shutters,"" says Shah. He adds that a large part of the Chinese import trade that he has seen others indulge in while doing business over the years is unethical and illegal, with unimaginable levels of under-invoicing and bribing at the customs and ports.

Yet, the new norms have put barriers on even seemingly legitimate business. Shah is hardly alone in expressing distress. Rebin Sunny of Omega Trading, who used to import half a dozen 40-ft containers of car tyres from China and Taiwan every month, is at a loss too. “Abrupt changes in import policies have jeopardized my business,"" he says.

The pandemic and the government’s efforts to reduce Chinese imports following the India-China border skirmishes in June have unsettled the trading community all across the country. In parliament, the commerce minister Piyush Goyal had claimed that imports from China have declined by more than a quarter (around 28%) to $22 billion during April-August 2020.

After New Delhi clamped restrictions on imports, thousands of importers, traders, and wholesalers are now forced to wait and watch while struggling to make ends meet.

Several months into the onset of diplomatic tensions which left a shadow on trade, India’s approach still seems to be largely blunt force instead of being targeted. And unintended consequences are steadily piling up. For instance, when Customs authorities began compulsory physical checks on all shipments originating from China, starting June, it further messed up economic revival in certain key sectors that rely on imported goods.

The import basket is quite diverse; Indians lap up a whole range of goods manufactured by its neighbour. They include electronic goods, smartphones, consumer durables, solar cells, pharmaceutical ingredients, industrial goods, vehicles, tyres, toys, fancy goods, sports goods and music instruments, among many others.

Most importers agree that bilateral trade has been growing alarmingly in the past decade and that India may need to take steps to reduce its dependence on China. But a barrage of tariff and non-tariff barriers came in at a time when India is already facing an economic crisis, without giving importers adequate time to prepare for the rainy day. The question now is: How quickly can India adopt a more nuanced strategy that would cause the least amount of impact on local actors?

Anti-China sentiments

There are a few quick takeaways. Despite all the political din, China continues to enjoy the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status. Goyal said in a statement that there is no proposal currently under consideration to withdraw the MFN status. While the government’s efforts are on to encourage local manufacturing and exports, India cannot afford to shut imports from China officially. Over the last few years, the government has forced many companies, especially in the telecom and auto sectors, to set up assembly lines and local production. Some companies have already started domestic sourcing and their products go under the ‘Make in India’ label.

Some importers in India have in fact sidestepped China and turned to Asean countries for sourcing their requirements due to fears of abrupt policy changes. On the other hand, some traders have started rerouting their imports through other countries. So, the expectation in some quarters is Chinese goods may end up in India via Taiwan or Vietnam, though costs shoot up for traders in case of rerouting.

A cross-section of importers has told Mint about how they’ve already been forced to shut down their businesses or go slow over the last few months. “The anti-China sentiments went through the roof. Many who had already built an inventory were struggling to empty their warehouses. Where is the question of placing new orders?"" asks Sumit Rawat, a Mumbai-based importer of high-end audio/video equipment.

Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which claims to represent 70 million traders in the country, said that there are several complaints that have been received in the last few weeks about ships being stranded and shipments being put on hold. “If there are curbs and ship movements are restricted, it’s also impacting exports. We have requested traders to send in their grievances so that we can take them to the government.""

The organisation intends to meet Piyush Goyal with two requests. “We need to get all shipments cleared without any delay. Second, the government should come up with short-term policy guidelines till the next Budget. The lack of clarity is not good for the economy,"" said Khandelwal.

FM’s long battle

On 1 February, finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman unleashed a furious attack on Chinese imports. The customs duty on tableware and kitchenware made of porcelain or China ceramic, clay iron, steel and copper were doubled to 20%. The duty on several electrical appliances such as water heaters, hair dryers, ovens, cookers, toasters, coffee makers, heaters, fans and grinders, among an array of such products, were also doubled to 20%. Duty on toys, dolls, tricycles and scooters saw a steep hike from 20% to 60%. The government was killing two birds with one stone: Slowly shutting down Chinese dominance wherever possible, and pushing local manufacturing.

For Kochi-based Kottaram Trading Company, which owns the popular Nolta brand of crockery ware and kitchen appliances, the Budget proposals were the first blow, quickly followed by the lockdown and the anti-China sentiments and the concomitant non-tariff barriers. Siby K Thomas, director (finance), said the economic slowdown induced by the pandemic and the recent tensions at the border have been the proverbial final nail on their Chinese imports.

“We have steadily brought down dependence on imports and moved to Indian production for half of our product line-up. But Indian production lacks the cosmetic finish that Chinese products provide. There is also at least a 10% increase in the cost of production. Going forward, we plan to spread out imports to other countries instead of concentrating on China. We have already begun importing glassware from UAE and Thailand. We will look to import goods from Asean countries and avail the duty benefits. Since there is a ban on foreign travel, we are going slow,"" says Thomas.

The pandemic has shrunk the domestic market, especially in south India, which is a big market for Thomas. “During the first three months of the lockdown, we saw a 40% drop in the purchase of consumer durables such as non-stick vessels, cutlery, glassware, crockery ware and such. The recovery is pretty slow,"" he says.

While overall business has shrunk, the spike in container freight cost in a highly volatile market has cut their profit margins too.

The ripple effects

For long, the Indian government wasn’t comfortable with China’s growing clout in the bilateral trade. In 2019-20, the trade between China and India stood at $82 billion, with a deficit of $49 billion in China’s favour. There is a dip in the deficit, but India’s exports continue to remain a fraction, one-sixth of the value of goods imported by India. China, which was India’s largest trading partner between 2013-14 and 2017-18, has already slipped below the US in 2018-19, and is likely to slide down the ranking further.

But the fact is that a flurry of recent moves to counter imports came at a cost. Many raw materials and key ingredients have been in short supply as imported goods keep getting detained at various ports and airports. In June, there were huge delays in the clearance of containers from ports. But before the situation could get out of hand, the government did swing into action and exempted import of some key raw materials for pharmaceutical products as well as goods brought in by top importers from compulsory checks. However, smaller companies and traders continue to face the music.

Delay in imports has had a devastating effect on Indian manufacturing. For instance, India’s pharma sector depends heavily on the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), or the raw materials, produced in China. Two-third of India’s imports of APIs come from China. Bloomberg has estimated the Chinese import bill at $2.4 billion, out of the total spending of $3.56 billion for API imports.

In June, the government also banned tyre imports and shut down a big parallel market in the country.

“We were regularly importing car tyres from Maxxis (Taiwan) and Linglong (China), two of the world’s top 10 tyre manufacturers. Even after paying over 43-45% duty (28% GST and 15% import duty), the tyres used to be sold at nearly 50% discount to the Indian products,"" says Rebin Sunny of Omega Trading. He was retailing them through a wide network of dealers in south India.

While most of the imported tyres went to the replacement market, there is also a sudden shortage of ultra-high performance (UHP) tyres in India, he says. “The luxury car makers in India were sourcing their special tyres from plants abroad run by Pireili, Continental, Michelin and the like. These companies do not have manufacturing facilities in India. Also, it’s difficult to build specialty tyres here because of low volume.""

After some automakers raised a hue and cry, the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has now started issuing licences on demand to them selectively for importing superior quality tyres that are not manufactured in India. “Apparently, these licences come with a caveat. You can import tyres only if they are meant for export-oriented vehicles,"" Sunny says. This leaves the luxury cars sold in the domestic market in a dilemma.

The government move to classify tyre imports into the restricted category was primarily to prevent dumping of low-quality tyres from China, which were retailed in India at 25-30% of the price of locally manufactured tyres. Of course, the move has helped domestic players to enhance production. A senior official from CEAT said most of the tyre factories in India, including those run by his company, are running at nearly 100% capacity, something not seen in many years.

Two other segments that are facing acute difficulty are electronic music instruments and sports goods. A whole range of keyboards and electric guitars from the likes of Korg, Yamaha and Fender was coming from China while most badminton/table tennis rackets, shuttles and accessories were being imported from China too. The stringent and time-consuming checks at ports are delaying the imports, creating a severe shortage in the domestic market.

In June, the government also restricted imports of television sets and agarbattis. In October, it banned the import of air conditioners with refrigerants. All these decisions were taken to boost domestic production.

As the government keeps an eye on dumping by China and other countries into India, traders are at the receiving end of sudden shifts, which have become frequent this year. “Surely, India should not be a dumping yard for anyone. Dumping is unethical and creates a lot of problems,"" says Khandelwal. But there is a caveat.

Only when a country or a firm exports an item at a price lower than the price of that product in its domestic market can it be called dumping, as per international trade rules. Of course, it impacts the price of that product in the importing country, leaving local manufacturers in the lurch. In such situations, international trade rules allow countries to impose tariffs on such products to provide a level-playing field to domestic players.

But for Indian manufactured goods to fill the emerging void, they will have to get price competitive. And fast. Or else, China’s loss may just be another Asian country’s gain.

“Most traders who earlier depended on Chinese imports are now shifting their procurement to other countries like Vietnam, Taiwan and South Korea,"" says Khandelwal. “It may take a year or so to stabilize."" There is enough empirical evidence to suggest that India is on an unfinished agenda.

Comex gold was trading moderately higher near $1,725/oz after a 0.6% gain on May 13. Gold traded higher, supported by choppiness in the equity market and the US dollar index.

Risk sentiment remains weak amid disappointing economic data, downbeat growth outlook, US-China tensions, increasing virus cases, fear of a second wave of infection in previous hotspots like China and warnings against rushed reopening of economies.

US PPI fell 1.3% in April, the biggest drop since the index began in December 2009, reflecting pressure on the economy. Adding to it, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the economy would take many months to recover from the pandemic.

ETF inflows also show continuing investor interest.

Gold holdings with SPDR ETF rose by 8.48 tonnes to 1,092.14 tonnes on May 13, the highest since April 2013.

Gold may witness choppy trade, reflecting a mixed trade in the US dollar. However, the general bias may be on the upside amid global growth concerns and hopes of additional monetary easing measures.

After a 1.9% decline on May 13, NYMEX crude was trading above $25 a barrel.

After sharp gains in the last few days, crude has turned directionless due to mixed factors.

Supporting crude price is the improving supply picture as OPEC and the US continue to reduce output. However, demand outlook continues to be bleak as major economies reel under virus-related restrictions.

US crude production fell for the sixth consecutive week to 11.6 million barrels per day, the lowest since July 2019 and 11.5% less than the record high level seen in February.

US Energy Information Administration, earlier this week, lowered its estimate for crude production for 2020 from 11.76 million barrels per day to 11.69 million bpd.

Along with the US, OPEC and allies are also aggressively cutting output. OPEC and allies 9.7 million barrels per day production-cut deal kicked in from May 1 and members are working on adhering to the terms.

Saudi Arabia has indicated it will cut output by an additional 1 million bpd to 7.5 million bpd starting June.

Demand concerns are high as weak economic data point to a negative impact of the virus-related restrictions.

US PPI slumped 1.3% in April as against the forecast of a 0.5% decline. Also weighing on prices is the weaker outlook, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that it may further lower global growth forecast.

Adding to demand concerns, after US EIA, OPEC also lowered its global forecast. In its monthly report, OPEC reduced its forecast for 2020 crude demand by 2.23 million bpd and expects it to fall by 9.07 million bpd.

Mixed factors may keep crude price choppy, however, general bias may be on the upside amid improving supply picture.

On May 14, the focus will be on IEA’s monthly outlook, US economic data and development relating to the virus outbreak and US-China tensions.

Fitch Ratings today it expects state-owned Indian Oil Corp's (IOC) net debt levels to increase due to its large capital expenditure and investment plans in the medium term and affirmed a rating equivalent to India's sovereign rating.

The 'BBB-' rating with stable outlook ""equalises the India-based company's rating with that of its largest shareholder, the State of India (BBB-/Stable), based on Fitch's Government-Related Entities (GRE) Rating Criteria,"" the rating agency said in a statement.

""Fitch expects IOC's capex to remain high to upgrade refineries to meet new emission standards (BS-VI) and to expand refining and petrochemical capacity, including the expansions currently underway.

Fitch forecasts average capex of Rs 25,000-30,000 crore per annum over the next five to six years,"" it said.

IOC's financial profile, it said, is likely to remain moderate over the medium term due to its high capex and investment plans.

Its financial profile has improved over the last couple of years with net leverage (net adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR) falling to 2.0x in the year ended March 2018 (FY18) from 2.7x in FY16 (FY17: 2.1x), mainly on account of higher gross refining margins (GRMs).

""We expect IOC's net debt levels to increase due to its large capex plans in the medium term. However, we believe IOC's credit metrics will remain comfortable with net leverage of around 2.5x over the next two to three years, provided its dividend outflow normalises from the high levels of the last two years,"" it said.

Fitch said it has assessed IOC's standalone profile at 'BB+' to reflect its dominant market position as the largest oil refining and marketing company (OMC) in India, the average-but-improving complexity of its refining assets and a moderate financial profile.

""High capex requirements are likely to keep free cash flows negative over the next few years,"" it said adding ut assesses IOC's status, ownership and control by the sovereign as 'strong'.

""Fitch assesses the socio-political implications of a default by IOC as 'very strong'. A default would significantly affect the country's energy security given IOC's position as the largest OMC.

""IOC, along with two other state-owned OMCs, imports a large share of crude oil - a default would jeopardise their ability to do so, resulting in disruptions to the economy, the statement said.

Fitch sees the financial implications of an IOC default as 'strong' as it is one of the key state-owned borrowers in India and a financial default may have a strong impact on the availability and cost of financing options for the state and other GREs, it said.

IOC has 80.7 million tonnes per annum of refining capacity (33 percent of the total in India). It operates 11 of the 23 refineries in the country.

IOC also has a 49 percent share of the country's crude and product pipeline (by length) and 44 percent share in petroleum products with over 48,170 customer touch points.

Fitch said IOC is exposed to the international crude-refining cycle as reflected in the volatility of its historical GRMs. However, the ongoing refinery upgrades are likely to lower the volatility impact over the medium term.

""We also expect IOC to benefit from strong demand for petroleum products in India over the medium term in light of its dominant market position,"" it said.

Petroleum-product consumption in India has increased strongly at a CAGR of 5.6 percent from FY12 to FY17 and we expect growth to remain strong (around 5 percent) over the medium term amid the prospect of robust GDP growth, it added.

Also, IOC's refining asset quality is expected to improve from the planned upgrade and expansion, resulting in higher profitability and cash flows.

IOC's strong liquidity, Fitch said, is reflected in its large cash and equivalents of around Rs 11,600 crore (including Oil Marketing Companies GoI Special Bonds) as at end-FY18 against long-term debt maturities of around Rs 3,500 crore.

In addition, the company had large unutilised working capital limits of around Rs 8,000 crore as of end-FY18. IOC also enjoys ready access to domestic and international capital and banking markets.","the board has approved implementation of Petrochemical and Lube Integration Project at lndianOil's Gujarat Refinery. the project is expected to cost an estimated cost of Rs 17,825 crore.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/investors-could-look-at-top-rated-company-fds-as-options-shrink/articleshow/76082199.cms,"Mumbai: Falling bank deposit rates should not make you lose heart. Fixed deposits of top-rated companies could be an attractive investment option, especially for those desiring safety and reasonable returns. With the Reserve Bank of India announcing the closure of government bonds that paid 7.75 per cent interest and the country’s largest lender State Bank of India slashing deposit rates, financial planners are advising investors to consider fixed deposits of companies such as HDFC, Bajaj Finance, ICICI Home Finance and Mahindra Finance.Investors in a corporate deposit can earn as much as 200-240 basis points higher than deposit with a nationalised bank like SBI. While an SBI deposit pays a maximum of 5.4 per cent, a deposit in Mahindra Finance pays 7.8 per cent for 40 months. Bajaj Finance offers 7.6 per cent for a five-year deposit. Investors can opt to receive interest payment on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, and many retirees often use such products to meet their monthly expenses.“Uncertainty in stock markets, negative environment around debt mutual funds and no fresh issuance of NCDs is turning investors towards corporate fixed deposits,” said Anup Bhaiya, CEO, Money Honey Financial, a Mumbai-based distributor.Investors prefer these companies because of their stable track record, strong parentage and top-notch ratings. While there is a preference for safety over higher returns, investors deem the current rates offered by banks to be unviable. The government bonds offered post-tax returns of 4.4 per cent annually for a person in the highest tax bracket. Though returns were not considered high, individuals preferred them for their safety. The highest interest rate offered by SBI is 5.4 per cent after the 40-basis point cut.“Investors are looking to lock money at higher rates in these corporate deposits as they believe rates will go down further,” said Rupesh Bhansali, head (distribution), GEPL Capital.Many senior citizens prefer corporate deposits over debt mutual funds as these are simple to understand, with defined rate of interest. The scrapping of six schemes by Franklin Templeton that has led to redemptions being stopped indefinitely has contributed to the aversion to debt funds. Returns after tax deductions in these fixed deposits work well for those whose income are not subject to tax or for people in the marginal tax bracket.Financial planners point out that investments in company FDs should be done after planning for emergency funds. “Build your contingency fund first through bank deposits and after that is done, opt for such deposits. Since they are illiquid, investment must be made with a view of holding till maturity,” says Vinayak Kulkarni, a Mumbai-based financial adviser.","falling bank deposit rates are turning investors towards fixed deposits. investors prefer companies because of their stable track record, strong parentage and top-notch ratings. government bonds offered returns of 4.4 per cent annually for a person in the highest tax bracket. the highest interest rate offered by SBI is 5.4 per cent after the 40-basis point cut. a deposit in ICICI Home Finance pays 7.8 per cent for 40 months.",Negative

NEW DELHI: The government issued revised GDP data for the 2005-12 fiscal years that lowered growth under the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, in contrast with recalculated numbers that had been released in August and sparking a controversy ahead of general elections in a few months. The back series adjusts GDP numbers for the period using new methodology with the base year as FY12.The four years of the current government show higher average growth than that achieved during the UPA under the recalibrated national accounts. Under the back series, growth in the UPA years was slower with the peak of 10.3% in FY11 scaled back to 8.5%.The August revision had shown four years of 9%-plus growth during FY06-FY08 while the latest numbers don’t cross 9%. The average growth for the UPA years after the back-series revision for FY06 to FY12 declines to 6.82% from 7.75% earlier, well below 7.35% during the four years of the present government. The UPA ruled from 2004 to 2014, when it gave way to the current BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.Former finance minister P Chidambaram said the Niti Aayog, which was involved in the exercise, should be scrapped. “Niti Aayog’s revised GDP numbers are a joke. They are a bad joke. Actually they are worse than a bad joke. The numbers are the result of a hatchet job. Now that Niti Aayog has done the hatchet job, it is time to wind up the utterly worthless body,” he said in a series of tweets.Questioning the revised numbers, Congress member Ahmed Patel said 140 million had been lifted from poverty and per capita income rose 300% during the UPA’s tenure. “No trickery can change this. They couldn’t beat UPA’s economic growth so they changed the formula to please themselves,” he said.“In its desperate attempt to rewrite GDP data, the government resembles the student who cannot pass an exam without cheating,” Congress leader Ahmed Patel said.Responding to Chidambaram’s comments, Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar tweeted: “@PChidambaram_IN it would be far more in keeping with your acumen to give us details of why the new back-series data is wrong than merely to assert that they are wrong. I challenge you to prove them to be technically deficient.”The August numbers had been calculated by the Sudipto Mundle committee set up by the National Statistical Commission (NSC), which had bumped up growth during the UPA years based on the socalled production-shift method. That showed growth to be faster in FY04-FY12 and lower before that in 1994-95, triggering a war of words between the BJP and Congress, with the latter claiming India did better under the UPA.“The UPA government delivered the best-ever decadal growth… The back-series calculation of GDP has proved that the best years of economic growth were the UPA years 2004-2014,” Chidambaram had said at the time.The government had dismissed the numbers saying the GDP back series issued by the NSC committee amounted to “experimental results” meant to facilitate a decision on the approach to be followed and were not official estimates. It also questioned the quality of growth under the UPA, saying it had been fuelled by debt and a high government fiscal deficit.Ministry of statistics and programme implementation secretary Pravin Srivastava said on Wednesday that the latest back-series calculation was made by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).All countries have to align GDP data with UN standards for comparison. “The government wanted the back-series data,” Srivastava said.The latest data show growth falling from a high of 7.9% in FY06 to 5.2% in FY12 as against 9.3% and 6.6% respectively under the old series with FY05 as base year. Kumar said this difference was not a coincidence.“The back-series GDP data is the result of hard work of CSO officials who had recalibrated the economy. These numbers have been thoroughly vetted by leading economists before being made official,” he said.Independent experts said the new numbers didn’t alter the overall trajectory.“Directionally, the new series is similar to the old series, which suggests that the latter was not misleading the policymakers on whether the pace of growth was accelerating or slowing down,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist, ICRA.Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist, India Ratings, said the data showed minor change. “Even this data shows deceleration in investment rate from 39.8% in FY11to 30.6% in FY18 and decline in gross savings rate to 29.6% in FY17 from 36.2% in FY11. These are major economic challenges which Indian economy is currently facing,” he said.The Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics (ACNAS) recommended the methodology used for calculating the GDP back series. While the methodology for preparing back-series estimate for 2004-05 to 2010-11 is largely the same as methodology followed in the new base (2011-12), in certain cases owing to limitations of the availability of data, either splicing method or ratios observed in the estimates in base year 2011-12 have been applied.",the government released revised GDP numbers for the 2005-12 fiscal years. growth under the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was slower. the revised numbers were released in august but were not recalculated. the government has been criticized for releasing the revised figures. the figures spark a controversy ahead of the general elections in a few months. former finance minister P Chidambaram said the revised numbers were a joke.,Negative
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/market-cap-to-gdp-ratio-lowest-in-10-years-time-to-buy-or-turn-cautious-5444751.html,"The ratio, which is also known as Warren Buffett indicator, compares the value of all stocks at an aggregate level to the value of the country's total output. A value above 100% indicates that the market is overvalued while a number close to 50% indicates that it is undervalued.

The market-cap-to-GDP ratio has declined swiftly – from 79 percent as of FY19 to 56 percent (FY20 GDP) – much below the long-term average of 75 percent and closer to levels last seen during FY09, according to a report by Motilal Oswal.

The market-cap-to-GDP ratio is currently at its lowest level since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. The ratio, which is used to determine whether the overall market is undervalued or overvalued, suggests that it might be the right time to put in money, but experts beg to differ.

The lowest in the last two decades was 42 percent in FY04. However, the number of listed and traded companies back then were much lower vis-à-vis today. The ratio hit a peak of 149 percent in December 2007 during the 2003-08 bull run, the report added.

The numbers might give an impression that the stock market might be trading at cheap levels, but experts suggest that the ratio does not reflect the true picture of the economy as well as markets. The true market-cap-to-GDP ratio is slightly skewed.

The success and the applicability of the market-cap-to-GDP ratio is higher when the market-cap reflects a much larger share of the economic activity in the country, said the Motilal Oswal report.

India Inc. in the year 2019 saw robust investment momentum from private equity with total investment of $37 billion as compared to $36.16 billion in the year 2018 (as per a report by private company data tracker Venture Intelligence).

“The true market cap to GDP ratio is slightly skewed as the PE investments which came in large numbers have not been captured while considering market cap. In addition to this, if one assesses the impact of COVID -19 which would largely materialise going ahead, the growth is projected to contract by 3.20% in FY2020-21 (World Bank),” Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Therefore, though this ratio looks attractive but optically it is still on a higher side taking into account the PE investment and true GDP picture,” he said.

“Historically, and specifically in recent years we always had low Mcap to GDP ratio. During the COVID-19 market crashed to abysmal levels and Mcap to GDP went below 50 which reflected the stark undervaluation in the broader market,” Paras Bothra, President of Equity Research, Ashika Stock Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Though this is not the only indicator to gauge the market valuation. Also, this indicator itself got changed sharply with decelerating GDP growth and anemic earnings,” he said.

Is it a wealth-creating opportunity?

The Indian market after slipping into a bear market has bounced back by more than 30 percent from the lows. Given that the ratio is slightly skewed, market cap-to-GDP ratio may be near its long-term average or slightly below but it is currently absolutely not at low levels on a like to like comparison, suggest experts.

Whether the aggregate Mcap rise or fall, identifying individual sectors which have its own bull and bear phase with changing fundamentals needs to be closely studied, they say.

“Identifying companies and emerging leaders in it which are likely to benefit from the tailwind of a sector is a reliable way to make sustainable wealth,” says Bothra of Ashika Stock Broking.

“Whether the overall market is in a bear or a bull market, there will be sectors which are always having a bull or a bear phase of its own for reasons mentioned above. This is primarily going to be my focus area,” he said.

Taher Badshah, CIO – Equities, Invesco Mutual Fund in an interview with Moneycontrol said that in a post-COVID world, the new normal for India Inc. will likely involve dealing with a defensive consumer, cautious borrowing and lending practices, conservative capital investing by corporates, greater digital and online intervention and even higher dependence on state support for driving growth in the system.

https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/construction-equipment-demand-to-falter-further-icra/1955839/,"The construction equipment industry is expected to witness 20% degrowth in calendar year (CY) 2020. A recent survey revealed that dealers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are saddled with significant inventory, which will negatively impact the carrying costs of the industry in H1 FY2021, said an Icra note on Monday. Demand revival is likely only in the third quarter of FY2021, the credit rating agency said.

The Indian construction industry is facing numerous headwinds as a result of the economic slowdown and other factors impacting construction activities. As a result, the construction equipment (CE) industry witnessed a significant volume degrowth of 16% in CY2019. Volumes degrew by 22% in FY2020. The situation has been further exacerbated by the Covid-19 outbreak and the nationwide lockdown. The industry is expected to degrow 20% during CY2020. These were the conclusions of Icra’s survey of CE dealers across 12 states in the country — Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, J&K, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The extensive survey was conducted throughout April.

According to Icra’s findings, in FY2020, 43% of the respondents witnessed volume degrowth > 25%. Dealers in few states like Karnataka and Bihar reported volume growth between 5 and 5%. Tough financing environment and liquidity strain in the market made it difficult for majority of the dealers to secure funding, thereby impacting sales to some extent during FY2020.

Majority of the respondents indicated that funds flow from the government was weak. While central government payment was flowing, payments from state governments were stuck, which, in turn, impacted CE demand. As for rental demand, 50% of the respondents said it was in line with previous years while 30% felt otherwise, which impacted fresh CE buying to a certain extent.

Sales during March was severely impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown as 83% of the respondents witnessed volume degrowth of more than 60% (in some cases as much as 80-90%). Typically, March of every fiscal is the best month during which the CE sales witnesses a surge in volumes. But this was not the case in FY2020, which lead to relatively higher inventory holding.

Currently, 85% of the respondents hold more than one month of inventory, thereby adding to higher interest costs for Q1FY2021. Despite tight conditions, dealers received timely funds from financiers for sales during February and March, even while the lockdown impacted sales in March.

Nearly 71% of the respondents expect demand to revive during Q3 FY2021, after Q2 FY2021, which is typically a lean period for the industry on account of monsoons. The extent of volume degrowth during FY2021 remains uncertain given current market conditions; 50% respondents expect volumes to decline by 15-25% while 29% expect volumes to remain flattish.

Emission norm change (on production of engines >50HP) to TREM IV standards for backhoe loaders and wheeled loaders is scheduled for October. More than 70% respondents expect the emission norm changes to be implemented as scheduled. More than 85% respondents expect cost of the equipment to increase by 5-10% given the upfront investments incurred by OEMs to implement emission norm changes in wheeled loaders and backhoe loaders.

Pavethra Ponniah, VP and sector head, Icra, said, “Apart from the impact of the lockdown during March to May, Covid-19 has crippled several industries and eroded livelihoods. Weakness in government revenues streams, more so at the states; redirected government support to healthcare, possibly at the cost of all other capital spends; the need for structural changes incorporating social distancing in several industries like construction; movement of labour and material; and the cost of restarting the economy — all these thwart the ability to make forecasts for sectors intrinsically linked to the underlying economy. Unforeseen headwinds will be many in the coming months.”","the construction equipment industry is expected to witness 20% degrowth in calendar year (CY) 2020. the situation has been further exacerbated by the Covid-19 outbreak and the nationwide lockdown. the credit rating agency said demand revival is likely only in the third quarter of FY2021. the survey was conducted across 12 states in the country. in FY2020, 43% of the respondents witnessed volume degrowth > 25%.",Negative

https://www.livemint.com/news/world/covid-19-impact-us-fed-officials-see-rates-remaining-low-through-2022-11591813014786.html,"Washington: The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday repeated its promise of continued extraordinary support for the economy as policymakers projected a 6.5% decline in gross domestic product this year and a 9.3% unemployment rate at year's end.

""The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,"" the Fed said in its latest policy statement. The first policymaker economic projections since December see the overnight interest rate remaining near zero through at least 2022.

Though much of the statement repeated language from its April meeting, the central bank did promise to maintain bond purchases at ""the current pace"" of around $80 billion per month in Treasuries and $40 billion per month in agency and mortgage backed securities - a sign it is beginning to shape its long run strategy for the economic recovery.

That is expected to begin in earnest in 2021 with growth forecast at 5%.

The pledge to keep monetary policy loose until the U.S. economy is back on track repeats a promise made early in the central bank's response to the coronavirus pandemic. That response included cutting its key overnight interest rate to near zero in March and making trillions of dollars in credit available to banks, financial firms, and a wide array of companies.

But the projections are the first issued since December, and offer policymakers' views on how fast employment and economic growth might recover, and an initial steer on how long the federal funds rate will be pinned down.

Through most of last year U.S. central bankers felt they were in an enviable spot, with record low unemployment, tame inflation, and a strong expectation that both would continue.

But the pandemic has now thrown them into what may be a years-long fight to bring Americans back to work after some 20 million jobs were lost from March through May.

On Wall Street, which had been near unchanged ahead of the Fed statement, stock prices rose, with the benchmark S&P 500 Index gaining by 0.3%. Treasury security yields rose and the dollar fell against the euro and yen.

https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/little-impact-so-far-on-global-food-supply-chain-but-anxiety-driven-panic-could-change-that-wfp/1918673/,"The rapidly growing novel coronavirus pandemic is so far having little impact on the global food supply chain, but that could change for the worse and soon if anxiety-driven panic by major food importers takes hold, the World Food Programme (WFP) has said.

In a new report, “COVID-19: Potential impact on the world’s poorest people: A WFP analysis of the economic and food security implications of the pandemic”, the UN agency said global markets for basic cereals are well-supplied and prices generally low.

However, given the highly globalised nature of food production and supply, commodities need to move from the world’s ‘breadbaskets’ to where they are consumed and the novel coronavirus-related containment measures are starting to make this more challenging.

“Disruptions are so far minimal; food supply is adequate, and markets are relatively stable,” WFP Senior Spokesperson Elizabeth Byrs said, noting that global cereal stocks are at comfortable levels and the outlook for wheat and other staple crops is positive for the rest of the year. “But we may soon expect to see disruptions in food supply chains,” she said, explaining that if big importers lose confidence in the reliable flow of basic food commodities, panic buying could ensue, driving prices up.

A grain market analyst at the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), quoted anonymously in the report, said the problem is not supply, but “a behavioural change over food security”. “What if bulk buyers think they can’t get wheat or rice shipments in May or June? That is what could lead to a global food supply crisis,” the analyst said.

For low-income countries, the consequences could be devastating, with long-term repercussions, with coping strategies coming at the expense of such essential services as health and education. It recalled that when a food price crisis struck in 2008, the world’s poorest households ? which typically spend the largest share of income on food ? suffered disproportionately.

Using the economic pillar of the Proteus food security index – and taking into account dependency on primary commodities such as fuel, ores and metals for export earnings – the report said that countries in Africa and the Middle East are most vulnerable.

Africa accounts for the majority of the almost 212 million people in the world who are chronically food insecure and the 95 million who live amidst acute food insecurity, the report said. Byrs said labour shortages could disrupt the production and processing of labour-intensive crops in particularly, especially in vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Other potential sources of disruption include blockages along transport routes ? a particular concern for fresh produce ? and quarantine measures that could impede farmers’ access to markets. Going forward, the WFP report said, it is essential to monitor food prices and markets, and to transparently disseminate information ? thus helping to strengthen government policies while also averting public panic, and social unrest.

It said that in places where food insecurity is caused by restricted access, rather than lack of availability, cash-based transfers — which can often be made through contactless solutions — should be considered as a standard response.

“Planning in-kind food assistance is essential,” the report said, noting that supply chain disruptions are likely to affect higher-value items first. Such items involve more tiers of suppliers, human interaction and dependency on few suppliers ? putting specialized nutritious food more at risk than staples, it said.","new report says global markets for basic cereals are well-supplied. but commodities need to move from 'breadbaskets' to where they are consumed. fears that panic buying could ensue if major importers lose confidence. if fears are not overcome, prices could rise, causing a global food supply crisis. 212 million people in the world are chronically food insecure.",Negative

The index has seen volatility as it traded in a wider range of around 190 points during the day and closed lower ahead of expiry of February futures & options contracts on Thursday.

The index formed bearish candle on the daily charts, though it managed to hold psychological 10,800 levels.

The volatility is likely to continue in coming sessions due to geopolitical tensions, experts said, adding once this event gets settled down, the Nifty50 is likely to move upwards.

The Nifty50 opened sharply higher at 10,881.20 to touch an intraday high of 10,939.70, but wiped out all gains in afternoon amid volatility and hit a day's low of 10,751.20. The index fell 28.60 points to close at 10,806.70.

""Bulls remained vulnerable to the cross border news flows as Nifty50 witnessed a wild swing of around 190 points in both the directions before signing off the session with a bearish candle which resulted in a modest cut when compared to its previous day’s close,"" Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.

He said as the trends are getting influenced by the external factors (news flows relating to geo political tensions), in the very short term market may remain volatile and unpredictable.

Once the dust gets settled around these issues market shall catch up with the prevailing short to medium term trend which slightly appears to be positively biased for time being, he added.

Mazhar said technically speaking, in the event of any positive development market may rally and initially head towards 11,000 kinds of levels whereas breach of 10,729 shall initially extend the downswing towards 10,645 kind of levels.

As markets are moving swiftly in both the directions, without giving proper directional clue, it looks prudent on the part of short term traders to remain on sidelines for time being, he advised.

Volatility was too high as India VIX moved up sharply by 10.45 percent at 18.90 levels.

Sudden spike in VIX has given a pause in the positive momentum and VIX has to cool down below 16-15 to get the smooth ride in the market, experts said.

On option front, maximum Put open interest (OI) is at 10,400 followed by 10,700 strike while maximum Call OI is at 11,000 followed by 10,900 strike.

Call writing is at 11,000 followed by 10,950 strike while Put unwinding is at immediate strike price.

Experts said option band signifies a trading range between 10,720 to 10,929 zones.

""Nifty index formed a bearish candle on daily scale as it has got stuck in a trading range and follow up action is missing on both the sides as dips are being bought while bounce is being sold in the market,"" Chandan Taparia, Associate Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

Now it has to continue to hold above 10,750 zones to extend its move towards 10,888 then 10,929 zones while on the downside support exists at 10,720 then 10,650 levels, he added.

Bank Nifty remained highly volatile throughout the session as it traded in a wider range of 26,700 to 27,200 zones. It closed 153.65 points lower at 26,799.30 and formed a Bearish Engulfing Candle on daily scale as selling pressure is being witnessed at higher levels.

""The index got stuck in between 26,666 to 27,200 zones since last 11 trading sessions. Now it requires a decisive range breakout from the current trading band to commence the next leg of momentum,"" Chandan said.

https://www.financialexpress.com/market/grand-plans-rs-53k-cr-rights-issue-to-help-ril-lighten-balance-sheet/1945355/,"In a capital raise that will help it further deleverage its balance sheet after the $5.7-billion deal with Facebook, Reliance Industries (RIL) on Thursday said it would mop up Rs 53,125 crore from shareholders via a rights issue. The conglomerate’s effective debt at the end of 2019-20 is estimated at around Rs 1.5 lakh crore and it hopes to become debt-free in CY2020. RIL ended 2019-20 with a consolidated operating profit of Rs 1,02,280 crore.

RIL said it was looking to complete a capital raise of Rs 1.04 lakh crore by June 2020 with help from the rights issue, Facebook’s Rs 43,600 crore investment and the previous investment by BP PLc.

The company said, on Thursday the deal to sell a 20% stake in its oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business to Saudi Aramco was on track.

A stronger balance sheet will allay concerns at a time when the Indian economy is expected to contract following the disruption due to the outbreak of Covid-19 and consumer demand is espected to remain muted. Post the Facebook deal announcement on April 21, Moody’s had observed: We expect the transaction to reduce RIL’s consolidated net debt/EBITDA by 0.4x to well below 3.0x, the tolerance level for its Baa2 rating.

RIL’s promoters have said they would subscribe to both their quota of shares as also all of the unsubscribed portion. Shareholders will be entitled to 1 share for every 15 shares held at Rs 1,257 apiece.

The capital will come in handy as analysts expect RIL’s operating profits — especially from the petrochemicals and refining businesses –to be under pressure this year. The digital and telecom businesses, however, are expected to do well. Moody’s noted it expected the company’s ebitda to decline over the next 12 months but said the credit metrics may remain appropriate for its ratings if it successfully executes its announced transactions.

On 12 August 2019, RIL said it has signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell a 20% stake in its Oil to Chemical (O2C) business to Saudi Aramco. The O2C business, which has an enterprise valuation of $75 billion, includes RIL’s refining and petrochemical divisions, and RIL’s 51% stake in its fuel marketing business. RIL also announced that it has entered into a deal with BP Plc to sell a 49% stake in its fuel marketing business in India for $1 billion. Moody’s said the proceeds from these transactions will result in a $16 billion reduction in RIL’s net debt. RIL’s first rights issue in three decades, will see partly- paid shares with a face value of Rs 10, being issued, allowing shareholders to pay up over a period of time. While 25% must be paid on application, the balance will need to be paid in one or more calls.",the conglomerate's effective debt at the end of 2019-20 is estimated at around Rs 1.5 lakh crore and it hopes to become debt-free in CY2020. the company said it was looking to complete a capital raise of Rs 1.04 lakh crore by June 2020. the deal to sell a 20% stake in its oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business to Saudi Aramco was on track.,Negative

https://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/science/japans-decision-to-release-fukushima-radioactive-water-into-sea-will-cause-disease-along-asian-coastal-belt-say-experts/2131019/,"Japan’s decision to release radioactive contaminated water from its wrecked nuclear plant in Fukushima into the sea by 2022 has led to alarm bells ringing in India with experts warning it would set a wrong precedent and impact aquatic and human life along coastal belts of several parts of the world.

The contaminants of the massive quantities of nuclear water will include radioactive isotopes such as cesium, tritium, cobalt and carbon-12 and may take from 12 to 30 years to decay. It will destroy everything it comes in contact with almost immediately and cripple the economy related to the fishing industry and lead to a spectrum of diseases, including cancer.

“This will be the first incident of high volumes of radioactive water being released in the sea and can set a wrong precedent for others to follow. Concerns related to the environment and health are crucial for the existence of the human race. Therefore, alternative arrangements may be debated globally,” A K Singh, director general of health science at the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO), told PTI.

On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the north-eastern coast of Japan, triggering a 15-metre tsunami that damaged the 5,306 MW Fukushima nuclear plant. It is the second biggest nuclear disaster in the history of nuclear power generation after Chernobyl in 1986.

After the accident, 1.2 million tonnes of radioactive contaminated water released from the reactors in over 1,000 tanks were kept in a cordoned off large area near the Fukushima plant.

However, authorities are running out of space as the plant is to be decommissioned and the Japanese government has decided to release the radioactive contaminated water in the sea starting 2022.

The decision to release the radioactive water was taken on October 16, 2020 after years of debate.

Singh, among the Indian government’s top nuclear health scientists, said the release of contaminated water into the ocean will directly impact human and aquatic life.

“The possibility of ingestion of tritium in humans will increase and since this isotope will distribute in all organs in humans and long. Radioactivity monitoring in fish and other aquatic life in near vicinity (coastal areas) and drinking water will be necessary. Deposition of the radioactive elements on the rocks has also to be seen,” he said.

While Japanese authorities have said the water would be diluted before being released and it would only contain only tritium, other health experts who have been monitoring the issue said the risk involved should never be undermined.

Yudhyavir Singh, assistant professor of anaesthesia and critical care at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said the risks will depend entirely on the amount of the contaminants present in the nuclear wastewater and their nature.

“Mostly contaminants are radioactive isotopes which include cesium, cobalt, carbon-14 and tritium. The half-life of cesium is 30 years, it will take 30 years of half of the material to decay. Also the half-life of tritium is 12 years,” he told PTI.

“All the radioactive isotopes are carcinogenic and can induce cancer on prolonged exposure. In Chernobyl, it has been seen in the rise of thyroid cancer post nuclear leakage after 20 years,” he said.

Once the water is released into the ocean, it would be advisable to move and stay away from the coastal area in the region while completely avoiding seafood, added Yudhavir Singh, who has several publications on critical care and is a renowned researcher too.

“In the past, it has been seen that radioactive material discarded in France travelled to the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and found in the bodies of seals and Tortoises,” he said, warning that South East Asian nations will be at higher risk.

Environmentalists and several organisations, including Safecast and Greenpeace, have urged the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the operator of the Fukushima plant, to build more storage tanks and keep the water stored.

Greenpeace claimed the water could change human DNA if consumed.

“Tritium is a beta emitter with low energy so causes damage to the DNA leading to genetic damage and affecting reproductions. It will depend upon the radioisotopes contaminants in the water. Cesium has a half-life of 30 years and will be the last to decompose,” Yudhyavir Singh said.

The quantity of cesium in the nuclear waste water may take 180-300 years to decompose, he said.

Citing studies from the World Health Organisation, M C Misra, former director of AIIMS, Delhi, said an increase for specific cancers for certain subsets of the population inside the Fukushima Prefecture is very likely.

“A 2013 report predicts that for populations living in the most affected areas there is a 70 per cent higher risk of developing thyroid cancer for girls exposed as infants, a 7 per cent higher of leukemia in males exposed as infants, a 6 per cent higher risk of breast cancer in women and 4 per cent higher risk, overall, of developing solid cancers for females,” Misra told PTI.

Misra, who has dealt with all types of medical cases, including that of radiation, said Japan could have easily prevented the entire accident.

“The Japanese focused on the prevention principle without paying due attention to the mitigation principle as if it was sure that an accident was impossible. The power unit of the Fukushima plant was built on the basis of a design developed in 1960 and, therefore, the station was not ready for a crisis situation of the 21st century,” Misra said, citing the complexity of such situations.","contaminants of massive quantities of nuclear water will include radioactive isotopes such as cesium, tritium, cobalt and carbon-12. it will destroy everything it comes in contact with almost immediately and cripple the economy related to the fishing industry. experts warn it will impact aquatic and human life along coastal belts of several parts of the world.

https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/cait-suggests-imposition-of-minimum-operating-price-for-products-on-e-commerce-sites/1767190/,"Traders body CAIT on Sunday suggested the government to impose a “minimum operating price” for products, alleging that traders are at the receiving end of a pricing onslaught posed by e-commerce firms and brands in collusion with banks. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has written a letter in this regard to Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal.

“Under the circumstances and visualising it as a price war, we suggest it is the high time when the government must step in and enforce the fundamental of Minimum Operating Price (MOP) which is the price consisting of landing price, operational cost and reasonable profit margin and below the MOP no product should be sold in the market,” CAIT said in the letter.

The traders’ body alleged that e-commerce companies and brands in collusion with banks, by charging much lower price than the actual market value are depriving the government of GST and other revenue. “It is the responsibility of the Brands to advise to their buyers to sell their products at MOP to maintain the market hygiene keeping in mind that retailer should earn at least minimum margin to cover his operational cost and earn very thin margin,” CAIT suggested in the letter to Goyal.

It said there should be a uniform policy of discounting by brands both for online and offline trade. “Cash back on credit cards given by the banks should also be made applicable to offline trade. There should not be any kind of exclusivity either for online or offline trade. Upgrade or buyback offer by brands should remain the same for both offline and online trade. All schemes of the brands should be made available to online and offline trade in a transparent manner,” CAIT said, arguing that this will create a level-playing field for every player in retail trade.

In this context, we suggest that the government should initiate a discussion with all stake-holders on MOP and frame rules for the same, the traders’ body observed. It also suggested that the government should constitute a Regulatory Authority to regulate and monitor all verticals of retail trade including small retail, big retail, e-commerce and direct selling besides MOP, and if anyone wants to offer any scheme, the same should be approved by the Regulatory Authority.

“The cash on delivery (COD) in e-commerce should not be allowed and all deliveries in online sale should accept digital payments only. We are sure that it will receive your kind attention and you will be pleased to take necessary action in order to curb unethical and unfair business practices of e commerce companies and restructuring of retail trade of India which is a key to vision of Prime Minister to make India a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024,” CAIT said.","traders' body CAIT has written a letter to the government on monday. it alleges that e-commerce firms and brands are depriving the government of revenue. the traders' body also suggested the government should impose a ""minimum operating price"" for products. it said there should be a uniform policy of discounting by brands both for online and offline trade.",Negative

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd are likely to see earnings decline and credit metrics weaken due to fall in oil prices, Moody's Investors Service said on Thursday. ONGC and OIL get rates equivalent to those prevalent in the international markets. Oil prices in the international markets last month slumped to a two-decade low of $18 per barrel before rebounding by some measure.

In addition to the decline in oil prices, ONGC and OIL also face a reduction in government-regulated prices for the natural gas they produce.

""We expect ONGC's earnings to decline and its credit metrics to weaken because of lower oil prices over the next 12-18 months,"" Moody's said in a report on Asian national oil and gas companies.

Although ONGC is an integrated oil and gas company, its downstream segment contributed only about 30 percent of its consolidated EBITDA for the year ended March 31, 2019 (fiscal 2019).

Crude oil, which accounted for about half of its total production, contributed nearly 80 percent of its upstream revenue in FY19.

""In addition to the decline in oil prices, ONGC also faces a decline in natural gas selling price. The natural gas selling price in India is regulated by the government of India which has revised the price of natural gas with effect from April 1, 2020, to $2.39 per million British thermal units (btu) from $3.23 per million btu,"" Moody's said.

ONGC's credit metrics, it said, will weaken but still remain appropriate for its baa2 rating.

""However, if prices remain depressed for longer than we expect, its credit metrics will weaken beyond our downgrade threshold,"" it said.

Although it is likely that ONGC will be able to reduce its capital spending, the company is yet to announce any such reductions. As a government-owned company, it will be challenging for ONGC to meaningfully reduce its dividends, the rating agency said.

""In terms of liquidity, ONGC has insufficient cash to address its near-term debt maturities. However, given that the company is majority-owned by the government, we expect it to be able to refinance its upcoming debt maturities through its access to Indian banks,"" it said, adding it had already downgraded ONGC to the same level as the sovereign rating on India (Baa2 negative).

A sovereign rating downgrade will result in a downgrade of the company's rating.

""ONGC also remains exposed to a possible consolidation in the oil and gas sector in India and may be asked by the government to acquire other oil and gas companies,"" it added.

For OIL, crude oil accounted for about 60 percent of its total production and about 80 percent of its total revenue in FY19.

""Based on our price assumptions, we expect OIL's EBITDA for FY21 will be about 55 percent lower as compared with FY20 and its credit metrics will be weaker than the tolerance level,"" it said, adding OIL's credit metrics will recover to levels appropriate for its baa3 rating by fiscal 2022.

In terms of liquidity, OIL has no material near-term debt maturity and thus will have adequate liquidity, provided it generates enough cash flow to fund its capital spending and shareholder returns.

Moody's said government support will continue to underpin Asian national oil companies' credit quality through the market downturn.

Sharply lower oil prices will hurt the earnings and strain their credit metrics.

""Should their credit metrics weaken materially and result in a decline in their Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA), we expect that the degree of rating movement for NOCs will be low,"" it said.

The rating agency said companies are expected to embark on austerity measures to conserve cash.

""National oil companies (NOCs) will likely scale back capital spending and investments to preserve cash to tide over the low price environment. Some NOCs will be able to reduce dividends, while others will find it more challenging to do so given their government's dependence on oil and gas sector revenue, especially as governments announce further economic stimulus packages,"" it said.

ONGC had announced an interim dividend in March.

""Most Asian NOCs will have adequate internal cash sources to fund planned capital spending and dividend payments in the low oil price environment. We expect the NOCs will continue to have strong access to capital given their strategic importance to their respective governments,"" it added.",ONGC and oil india likely to see earnings decline and credit metrics weaken.

https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/is-india-ready-for-economic-growth/1991504/,"Economic growth is about increasing the value of measurable economic activities, and is a convenient (if overemphasised) proxy for increases in welfare. One can measure aggregate economic activity by capturing its components, valuing them and adding them up, either from the perspective of expenditure, or income. India’s pandemic lockdown brought a forced halt to a large fraction of economic activity, so national income and expenditure would naturally take a big hit.

The problem in such circumstances, aside from the fundamental issue of basic survival for many people affected by the loss of income, is that such reductions have ripple or multiplier effects, deepening and prolonging the initial loss. This phenomenon led to the Great Depression of the 1930s, and that traumatic time helped to change the way in which appropriate economic policy responses were conceived. In particular, government was recognised as being uniquely able to spend in bad times (including transferring money to its citizens, who would do the actually spending in that case), to cushion first-order income losses and their even more substantial ripple effects.

Every government has been responding in this manner to pandemic-caused halts to economic activity. In previous columns, I reported what I thought was a broad consensus view, that the Indian government’s fiscal response has been inadequate, given the hit taken by the economy as a result of the lockdown. It has been a bit difficult to estimate the overall impact of government measures, in terms of net fiscal “stimulus”, but a dozen or so different analysts reported numbers mostly ranging around 1% of GDP (the standard measure of aggregate economic activity). Recently, however, Surjit Bhalla, who holds a very important position as India’s Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), provided a headline number of a 5% fiscal package.

He argued that this is one of the largest responses among all economies in the world, and that India is now “Ready for Growth”. I hope he is correct, but given the importance of this issue for the Indian economy going forward, the basic issue of how much the government is supporting aggregate economic activity seems to be worth re-examining, before one gets into issues of the quality of structural reforms and long-run growth prospects.

Bhalla bases his estimate on the IMF Policy Tracker, which reports its own estimates of various components of the government’s economic package. He reports added expenditure of 3.5% for poor households, migrant workers and agriculture, plus another half percent transfer to state governments, together totalling 4% or so. The headline number is not derived explicitly, but is supported by some qualitative arguments, including methodological disagreements with all the analysts who preceded him. The methodological issues seem to be complex, and include issues of where spending gets counted, and whether certain kinds of guarantees indirectly support spending that would otherwise not have taken place.

Who is more accurate? Reviewing one analysis, as reported in The Wire on May 17, provides a detailed calculation of a direct fiscal stimulus of 1% of GDP, much less than the IMF numbers, the sources of which are not provided. More recently, Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India and chairman of the National Statistical Commission, has also offered calculations that amount to around a 1% fiscal stimulus, possibly doubled by multiplier effects. Using a consistent approach, he estimates the corresponding response to the 2008-09 crisis, which was much less severe, at 3% of GDP. Yet, another detailed and thoughtful evaluation of the entire economic package, by Rajeswari Sengupta and Harsh Vardhan (like Sen’s analysis, available at http://www.ideasforindia.in) concludes that the incremental government spending in the overall package is less than 2% of GDP.

Several analysts of the temporary shock to economic activity estimate its magnitude at 10% or more of annual GDP for 2020-21. In that case, even a 5% stimulus would be inadequate, and the bulk of analyses indicate that even allowing for indirect effects, the total package the government has come up with is less than that. On the bright side, the monetary policy response has been more appropriate, but monetary policy measures are not as direct as putting money into people’s pockets, and the distributional impacts are also less favourable than when money is transferred to the poor.

I have not been able to find an official government analysis, or a rebuttal of academic and private sector analyses of the economic package, beyond the government’s own discourse and framing. The issue is not one of politics or of the quality and impact of economic reforms: it is a basic question of what the government is actually planning and accomplishing in its efforts to engineer an economic recovery from the lockdown. India will resume growth, but the questions are how much and how soon, and what will be the ultimate economic cost in terms of lost income and welfare. The answers depend on what the government does, and, at least to me, it is not clear that it is doing the best it can.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/eu-launches-antitrust-investigations-into-apples-app-store-apple-pay-5411851.html,"The European Commission on June 16 launched formal antitrust investigations into tech giant Apple's rules pertaining to its App Store and Apple Pay platforms. The two parallel investigations will assess whether Apple's rules for app developers on the distribution of apps via the App Store and its conduct in connection with Apple Pay violate the European Union's (EU's) competition rules.

The probe into Apple's App Store will look into the mandatory use of Apple's own proprietary in-app purchase system and restrictions on the ability of developers to inform iPhone and iPad users of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities outside of apps.

Meanwhile, the other investigation will look into the company's ""terms, conditions and other measures for integrating Apple Pay in merchant apps and websites on iPhones and iPads, Apple's limitation of access to the Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality (“tap and go”) on iPhones for payments in stores, and alleged refusals of access to Apple Pay.

""...the Commission has concerns that Apple's terms, conditions, and other measures related to the integration of Apple Pay for the purchase of goods and services on merchant apps and websites on iOS/iPadOS devices may distort competition and reduce choice and innovation,"" it said in a statement.

Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of the Commission's competition policy, said, ""It appears that Apple obtained a “gatekeeper” role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple's popular devices. We need to ensure that Apple's rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers, for example with its music streaming service Apple Music or with Apple Books.""

She also noted, ""Mobile payment solutions are rapidly gaining acceptance among users of mobile devices, facilitating payments both online and in physical stores. This growth is accelerated by the coronavirus crisis, with increasing online payments and contactless payments in stores. It appears that Apple sets the conditions on how Apple Pay should be used in merchants' apps and websites. It also reserves the “tap and go” functionality of iPhones to Apple Pay. It is important that Apple's measures do not deny consumers the benefits of new payment technologies, including better choice, quality, innovation and competitive prices.""","the european commission launches antitrust investigations into apple's rules. the probe will look into the mandatory use of Apple's own proprietary in-app purchase system. the other investigation will look into the company's measures for integrating Apple Pay. the Commission says it has concerns that Apple's rules may distort competition. the company reserves the ""tap and go"" functionality of iPhones to Apple Pay.",Negative
https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/demonetisation-effect-unemployment-rate-hit-45-year-high-in-2017-18-shows-leaked-govt-report/1460361/,"India’s unemployment rate rose to a 45-year high during 2017-2018, the Business Standard newspaper on Thursday quoted a government survey as showing, in the latest setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi just months before a tightening election.

The assessment by the National Sample Survey Office conducted between July 2017-June 2018, showed the unemployment rate stood at 6.1 percent, the highest since 1972-73, Business Standard reported.

The survey has become a political issue after the acting chairman and another member of the body that reviewed the job data resigned saying there was delay in its release. The head of the government-funded National Statistical Commission P.C. Mohanan said on Wednesday that he and colleague J. Meenakshi were unhappy at the non-publication of jobs data that had been due for release in December and alleged interference by other state agencies over backdated GDP data.

Business Standard said the report showed that joblessness stood at 7.8 percent in urban areas compared with 5.3 parts in the countryside. The data is significant because this was the first comprehensive assessment of India’s employment situation conducted after Modi’s decision in November 2016 to withdraw most of the country’s banknotes from circulation overnight, the report said.

India’s economy has been expanding by 7 percent plus annually — the fastest pace among major economies — but the uneven growth has meant there are not enough jobs created for millions of young Indians entering the workforce each year. This has put pressure on Modi as he seeks to retain power in a general election due by May.

Earlier this month, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a leading independent think-tank, said the country lost as many as 11 million jobs last year.","the assessment by the National Sample Survey Office showed the unemployment rate stood at 6.1 percent, the highest since 1972-73. the survey has become a political issue after the acting chairman and another member of the body that reviewed the job data resigned saying there was delay in its release. the head of the government-funded national Statistical Commission said he and colleague.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with Russia and other producing countries - a grouping known as OPEC+ - agreed over Easter to cut output by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in May and June, equating to about 10 percent of global supply before the coronavirus outbreak.

Additional output cuts by the United States, the world's biggest producer, and other nations outside the OPEC+ group will take the estimated total reduction to about 19.5 million bpd.

""With demand destruction forecasts ranging from 15 million to 22 million bpd in April 2020 and these measures not even coming into place until May, we are likely to see a substantial overhang in the short-term,"" said Nitesh Shah, director of research at New York-based WisdomTree Investments.

Oil prices remain more than 50 percent down this year.

Rystad Energy's head of oil markets, Bjornar Tonhaugen, said that implementation of the international deal would be a logistical challenge that would take weeks at least.

""Reducing upstream supply is not just turning off the tap or pushing a button. We would be surprised to see overall OPEC+ compliance at 50 percent through May,"" he said.

Inventories, where available, are expected to fill up fast even as some countries among the G20 group of nations agreed to buy oil for their national reserves.

Still, U.S. production is falling in tandem with a drop in prices and there are signs that the coronavirus outbreak may have peaked in some areas of the world.

In China, where the virus started and is now largely under control, demand appears to be returning, with data showing that crude oil imports rose 12 percent in March from a year earlier.

Supporting prices, U.S. shale oil output is expected to register a record monthly drop in April, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Monday.

Production has been sliding for several months, but the declines are expected to accelerate sharply in April with a loss of nearly 200,000 bpd of production, the EIA said.","oil prices plunge again as investors are unconvinced that record supply cuts could soon balance markets. the coronavirus pandemic has wiped out more than 50 percent of global oil supply.

https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/there-are-jobs-in-2017-jobs-gain-was-12-8-million-says-pmeac-member-surjit-bhalla/1244824/,"At the time when the Narendra Modi government is facing criticism for jobless growth, noted economist and PMEAC member says that in 2017, there was a job gain of 12.8 million. In a column written in the Financial Express on Saturday, Surjit Bhalla said, “If the QES data is extrapolated to the entire non-farm population, job growth in India was 10 million; EPFO based estimates place it at 7 million; our estimate for 2017 (CMIE data) is a job gain of 12.8 million.”

He said that there are three independent but piecemeal sources of data on employment growth—QES, CMIE and EPFO. Analysing different data, Surjit Bhalla said that the employment growth has been the highest in NDA periods. “In the UPA period coincident with NSSO data (2004/5 to 2011/12) GDP growth averaged the highest ever, with a CAGR of 7.8 % a year (as also inflation—CAGR of 7.4 %—but that story can be told on another day). However, employment, (principal status), increased by only 11 million; according to the weekly status, employment increased by a similar 11.4 million,” he wrote in the column.

“This was the employment creation inheritance of PM Modi. And, before the economy could really get started, it was hit by two successive droughts in 2014/15 and 2015/16,” he said, adding that droughts are not good for employment is an old true fact.

Making a strong case for health employment growth in India, he also said that the jobs data by Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) is the most pessimistic. “The raw CMIE data (unadjusted by Census population estimates for 22 age-sex groups; 15-19, 20-24… >=65 years for both men and women) shows a total job gain of 1.4 million. But, this is incorrect since the survey population in each age-sex cell is not a good estimate of the Census population in each age-sex cell,” he wrote.

The Narendra Modi government has been saying that there has been job creation and what is lacking is comprehensive jobs data. The government is expected to release a jobs data report later this year, which will map creation of jobs with a different and efficient methodology.","noted economist says in 2017, there was a job gain of 12.8 million. he says there are three independent sources of data on employment growth. the government is expected to release a jobs data report later this year. he says the data is not accurate since the survey population is not a good estimate. he says the data is not reliable and that the economy is not doing well.",Negative
https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/fpi-outflow-hits-4-month-high-of-rs-21000-cr-in-sept/story/283227.html,"Overseas investors pulled out a massive Rs 21,000 crore ($3 billion) from the capital markets in September, making it the steepest outflow in four months, on widening current account deficit amid global trade tensions.

The latest withdrawal comes following a net infusion of close to Rs 5,200 crore in the capital markets (both equity and debt) last month and Rs 2,300 crore in July.

Prior to that, overseas investors had pulled out over Rs 61,000 crore during April-June.

According to the latest depository data, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) withdrew a net sum of Rs 10,825 crore from equities in September and Rs 10,198 crore from the debt market, taking the total to Rs 21,023 crore ($3 billion).

This was the highest outflow since May, when FPIs had pulled out Rs 29,775 crore. FPIs never fully returned to the Indian equity markets after pulling out net assets worth Rs 61,000 crore during the quarter ended June 2018.

Although they net bought assets to the tune of Rs 7,500 crore cumulatively in July and August, the quantum of inflows was much lower than what was seen in the past when they invested with full conviction.

This indicates that there has been a fair bit of uncertainty and cautiousness among FPIs investing in the Indian equity markets in the recent times, experts said.

The outflow in September was due to global trade tensions, widening current account deficit on the back of surge in oil prices, depreciating rupee, concerns over the government's ability to meet fiscal deficit targets and lower than expected GST collection, said Himanshu Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst at Morningstar.

""All these factors deteriorated the country's macro environment. It has also cast a doubt on the sustainability of the economic growth which is closely watched by the FPIs. This coupled with expensive valuation triggered a sell-off from FPIs in September,"" he noted.

Additionally, given the global trade tensions, there has been risk-aversion among foreign investors which explains their cautious stance towards emerging markets like India, which are considered to be riskier than their developed counterparts, he added.

So far this year, FPIs have pulled out over Rs 13,000 crore from equities and more than Rs 48,000 crore from the debt markets.","foreign investors pulled out a massive Rs 21,000 crore ($3 billion) from the capital markets in September. this was the steepest outflow in four months, on widening current account deficit. this was due to global trade tensions, depreciating rupee and concerns over deficit. experts say there has been a fair bit of uncertainty and cautiousness among foreign investors.",Negative
https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/fitch-ups-indias-economic-growth-forecast-to-7-4-for-fy19-but-cites-these-as-risks/1205108/,"Fitch Ratings today raised India’s economic growth forecast to 7.4 per cent for 2018-19 but cited higher finance costs and rising oil prices as risks. It also said that the rupee has been among the worst performers vis-a-vis Asian currencies this year. The global credit rating agency had earlier estimated the GDP growth at 7.3 per cent for the current financial year. For 2019-20, it projected the growth at 7.5 per cent. Fitch forecast global oil price to remain around USD 70 per barrel in 2018, up from USD 54.9 a barrel last year. It said it expects oil price to cool to USD 65 a barrel next year. “We have revised up our forecast for 2018-19 growth to 7.4 per cent from 7.3 per cent in March. However, higher financing costs (stemming from monetary tightening and higher market premiums) and rising oil prices should limit the upside to growth,” Fitch said in its Global Economic Outlook.

The Indian economy grew at 6.7 per cent in 2017-18. In the fourth quarter (January-March) the GDP grew at 7.7 per cent. Fitch said the Indian rupee has been one of the worst performing currencies in Asia this year, although the depreciation was more muted than during the 2013 taper-tantrum episode. “India has better macroeconomic fundamentals than in 2013 and very low foreign ownership rates in the domestic government bond market, but the current account deficit has been widening as a result of rising oil prices, reviving domestic demand and poor manufacturing export performance,” it said. Last month, US-based Moody’s cut India’s growth forecast for 2018-19 to 7.3 per cent from 7.5 per cent citing rising oil prices.

Fitch said inflation has picked up since mid-2017, despite food inflation being muted. “The rise in the oil price and the INR depreciation should add to price pressure in the coming months, although we expect inflation to be contained within the upper band of the RBI’s target range.” Fitch projected retail inflation to be 5 per cent by the end of 2018. The Reserve Bank earlier this week hiked its policy rate by 0.25 per cent, citing inflation risks. Fitch retained the global growth forecast at 3.3 per cent in 2018 and 3.2 per cent for 2019, reflecting the disappointment over distribution of growth, with shortfalls in a number of smaller economies. It said however that expansion will be on-track or slightly better in the world’s two largest economies – the US and China.

It also said the near-term global growth prospects remain robust despite rising trade tensions and political risks. Fitch Chief Economist Brian Coulton said: “Global trade tensions have risen significantly this year, but at this stage the scale of tariffs imposed remains too small to materially affect the global growth outlook. “A major escalation that entailed blanket across-the-board geographical tariffs on all trade flows between several major countries would be much more damaging.”

It said a major escalation that entailed blanket across the-board geographical tariffs on all trade flows between major countries would be much more damaging. “This still looks quite unlikely, but the US administration’s continuing focus on reducing bilateral trade deficits – which will be very hard to achieve in the near term – increases the risk of sustained tensions,” Fitch said.","rupee has been among the worst performers vis-a-vis Asian currencies this year. global oil price forecast to remain around USD 70 per barrel in 2018. rupee grew at 6.7 per cent in 2017-18, compared to 7.7 per cent in 2013. rupee is expected to be the most volatile currency in the world. a softer rupee could mean a stronger growth in the coming months.",Negative

I am structurally bullish and in long-term investing, there is nothing wrong in that: Porinju Veliyath I still believe one has to invest in midcaps and smallcaps to make much higher returns than the market, Porinju Veliyath, Founder & Portfolio Manager, Equity Intelligence India, tells ET Now.

You can skip through the corrections and still create wealth, that is my experience over the last 30 years,, Founder & Portfolio Manager,, tells ET Now . The IT stocks now, in spite of apprehensions, uncertainties and grey areas, are growing at 15-20% if you see last five years’ CAGR. The 10-year CAGR looks even better.Edited excerpts:It is very true that the macros are reversing and dramatically. Not many people expected the way oil prices reversed, the rupee and the markets got steady, The media have been exaggerating the negatives. When the market has a bad sentiment, investors are not in a buying mood, it adds to the agony. There was so much exaggeration regarding the trade war, the NBFC crisis and again the so-called macro headwinds. Now things are looking better and there are reasons for the investors to cheer.We had a very bad 2018. It was very painful for all kinds of investors. Those who were not affected earlier got affected in the later part of the year. That is definitely going to reverse in 2019. It is an election year. Many investors are waiting for the election before taking a buying or investing decision.But that is not the way one should look at equity or long-term investing. It is perhaps a very good opportunity when people are talking about the election outcome and whether Modi will come back or not. That is not very relevant at this point of time for long-term investors.In the past, after every election, irrespective of the fact whether or not the outcome was liked by investors or corporates, the markets have always gone up, The best example is 2004 when Congress and CPM jointly formed a government. Most people thought there is nothing worse than that but still the markets performed very well. That has gone up three times in subsequent years and this time the concerns are very different. Ultimately it melts down to the earnings of companies and valuation. It is a very comfortable time in the market for new investors to come and invest in equities. The existing investors hold on to their investments with a lot of confidence.The leadership changes after every fall in the market. Even this time, the future opportunities are going to be very different. People should not go by past performance and the past leadership. We are heading for new sectors and new opportunities and themes.In that context, we have recently been looking at IT, especially the midcap IT segment. Normally investors see it as a rupee trade. That is why it did not do very well. There has been consolidation over the last 18 years. In the previous two rallies, the IT stocks were almost ignored, even though the rally in 1999-2000 was led by IT stocks.The IT stocks now, in spite of all those apprehensions, uncertainties and grey areas, are growing at 15 to 20% if you see last five years’ CAGR. The 10-year CAGR looks better. Even earning wise, it is better than the revenue CAGR. The price earnings multiples are at historical lows.Just compare this with the consumer companies, the FMCG companies are growing at 8-10%. The best of them are growing at 12% and we are giving 30 and 40 PE multiples. The question here is whether it is a secular growth. Can we expect 15-20% CAGR for these companies for the next five years? I believe a lot of these midcap companies are making innovations and a lot of them are reinventing themselves, going for more digital revenues.Such companies are going to grow at 15-20% and I would not be surprised if a few of them grow 20-25%. This can be one of those leaders of the next bull market , especially in 2019.Yes. The housing finance companies (HFCs) and NBFCs were much fancied in the last many years and had too high valuations. Some of these companies tried to take advantage by manipulating and by hiding things. Now things are getting settled but at the same time, I do not think this is something which can bring down India or its economy or its financial system.It is not that big. Some people are comparing the NBFC crisis even with the Lehman crisis. That is nonsense. We are not up to that. So, things will get settled. I believe the worst is over for the sector.In the finance sector, as it is, the bankruptcy code, the NPA resolution process is very encouraging. Of course, we all wish it was much faster and much more but it has got its limitations. This is the dirt that has accumulated over the last many years and it will take some time to show progress.It is a slow process but is very impressive. People have been under-estimating the bankruptcy code and other reforms happening in this country. This will go a long way. It will be remembered after 10, 20 and 30 years. Our financial system is getting stronger than before.There was a time even I was very bullish on this sector. We expected a lot of upturn in the whole vertical but it was a bit disappointing and the stocks in the sector have performed very badly. Shankara and all is a very different thing. They have got company specific issues and that’s why I never invested into that.We have a company called Hindustan Sanitaryware, HSIL and that stock has come to a multiyear low. But many solid companies in that segment have corrected well and investors can look for some of those companies in the sector.Eventually, housing construction will bounce back. Perhaps the demonetisation halted the float of black money in the system. But this is a temporary phenomenon, Ultimately people will make homes and there will be deals. We are just coming back. There was a one-two years of gestation period after demonetisation and the crackdown on black money. That was very important and a much required thing.But investors can look for some select stocks in that sector. It remains a good sector.I have mostly been fully invested. Structurally I am very bullish. I believe life is so short. I do not want to go into negativism and waste my life. I am structurally a bullish person. I love my country. I have that positive way of looking at things and in long term investing and there is nothing wrong in that. You can skip through the corrections and still create wealth that is my experience over the last maybe 30 years.I have to admit that I am going through some kind of embarrassing time as a fund manager because lot of people who have invested do not really understand volatility, especially people who have invested with me knowing that I predominantly invest in the midcaps and smallcaps all the time. I still believe that is the way to go if you want to make much higher returns than the market. So, there will be some pockets where you will be hit hard and we are going through this in 2018.I believe the whole thing will be reversed in 2019 but at the same time there will be some companies which I have invested or you have invested, generally people have invested they may not come up in the next rally or in the coming years. So one has to be very careful and very choosy.The times are changing. The disruptive world out there and many small businesses may not survive well and profit margins can be affected. It is too dynamic a situation. As investors you have to look for new themes and opportunities in the market that is where the fun is. But we also have got stuck with some stocks which we cannot even sell and buy something good. I am very confident it is a fantastic opportunity.At the same time, markets in general, are not very cheap. I definitely have to agree to that. You have to go through the new themes and opportunities to make money going forward. Markets are not very cheap but at the same time the earnings were also depressed. So, look at the normalised earnings and the price earning multiples. The market is very comfortable now in general and stock picking is going to be exciting.Yes, we still hold the shares. That is one of our largest holding in portfolio management. I still have the conviction.I do not know. If I am not bullish, I would not be holding it. In case of Kaya there is a very trustable management with futuristic business model. It is a well-managed company and the valuations are very attractive at this point of time. We are holding the shares. We have got vested interest so please do not take it as a recommendation.By December 2019, Nifty and Sensex is definitely going to be at new highs. Markets have been in highs and at the same time, investors have lost money. Some of the stocks that have been beaten down are investment-worthy companies. I am seeing hundreds of stocks which will be more than 100% up by next December 2019. That is a tremendous opportunity despite the election outcome and at the same time I am very confident that the current government will continue and reforms will be followed up. We are in the right inflexion point.","Porinju Veliyath, Founder & Portfolio Manager, equity intelligence india, tells ET Now. he says investors can skip through corrections and still create wealth. the IT stocks now are growing at 15-20% if you see last five years’ CAGR. the media have been exaggerating the negatives.

https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/us-to-allow-8-countries-to-continue-buying-iran-oil-after-sanctions-on-november-5-says-mike-pompeo/1370827/,"The US has agreed to temporarily allow eight countries to continue buying Iranian oil after it reimposes crippling sanctions on Tehran on November 5, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday, citing “significant reductions” in imports of oil from the Persian Gulf nation. India is one of the countries expected to get the exemptions. But senior administration officials refused to spell out the names on Friday. The list of these exemptions would be announced on Monday, Pompeo told reporters during a conference call on Iranian sanctions, with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. While the US had previously wanted countries including India to completely halt oil purchases from Iran by November 4 when its full sanctions against Tehran come into force, it seems to have relented considering the havoc the move to completely take out Iranian supplies from the market would have had on prices.

Pompeo said that countries like India, if it gets the exemption, would be asked to bring down their oil imports from Iran to zero in six months’ time. Negotiations are still ongoing, he said explaining the reasons for not revealing the names of the countries that are expected to get exemptions from the US from this latest and so far the toughest American sanctions on Iran.

“We expect to issue some temporary allotments to eight jurisdictions, but only because they have demonstrated significant reductions in their crude oil and cooperation on many other fronts and have made important moves towards getting to zero crude oil importation. These negotiations are still ongoing. Two of the jurisdictions will completely end imports as part of their agreements. The other six will import at greatly reduced levels,” Pompeo said. These economic sanctions are just a part of the US government’s total effort to change the behaviour of the Iranian regime, he said.

“On November 5th, the United States will reimpose sanctions that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal on Iran’s energy, shipbuilding, shipping and banking sectors. These sanctions hit at core areas of Iran’s economy. They are necessary to spur changes we seek on the part of the regime,” he said. “In order to maximise the effect of the president’s pressure campaign, we have worked closely with other countries to cut off Iranian oil exports as much as possible,” Pompeo said.

The expected list of exemptions to eight jurisdictions, that too temporary, is far less than the 20 countries, including India, which were exempted from Iranian sanctions during the previous Obama administration, he said. “We will have issued, if our negotiations are completed, eight and have made it clear that they are temporary,” he said. “Not only did we decide to grant many fewer exemptions, but we demanded much more serious concessions from these jurisdictions before agreeing to allow them to temporarily continue to import Iranian crude oil. These concessions are critical to ensure that we increase our maximum pressure campaign and accelerate towards zero,” Pompeo said.

As a result of the latest sanctions, he said the US expects to have reduced Iranian crude oil exports by more than 1 million barrels even before these sanctions go into effect. “This massive reduction since May of last year is three to five times more than what many analysts were projecting when President Trump announced our withdrawal from the deal back in May,” he said. “Starting today, Iran will have zero oil revenue to spend on any of these things. Let me say that again: Zero. 100 percent of the revenue that Iran receives from the sale of crude oil will be held in foreign accounts and can be used by Iran only for humanitarian trade or bilateral trade in non-sanctioned goods and services,” he said.

Pompeo said the latest US sanctions are targeted at the regime, not the people of Iran who have suffered grievously under this regime. “It’s why we have and will maintain many humanitarian exemptions to our sanctions, including food, agriculture commodities, medicine and medical devices,” he said. India, which is the second biggest purchaser of Iranian oil after China, is willing to restrict its monthly purchase to 1.25 million tonnes or 15 million tonnes in a year (300,000 barrels per day), down from 22.6 million tonnes (452,000 barrels per day) bought in 2017-18 financial year, sources in New Delhi said.

The US will also demand the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) global financial network stop supporting Iranian banks as part of enforcing sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear programme and alleged support for terrorism.

In May, President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 landmark Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) terming it as disastrous”. Under the Obama-era deal, involving five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany, Iran agreed to stop its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. After the US’ withdrawal from the deal, Trump signed fresh sanctions against Iran and warned countries against any cooperation with Tehran over its controversial nuclear weapons programme. Iran has dismissed these charges and maintains that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.","the list of exemptions would be announced on Monday, secretary of state said. if India gets the exemption, it would be asked to bring down their oil imports from Iran to zero in six months’ time. the list of exemptions is far less than the 20 countries, including india, which were exempt from the sanctions. the sanctions were lifted as part of the nuclear deal on Iran’s energy, shipbuilding, shipping and banking sectors.",Negative

Excerpts from an interview:

Why has it been so hard to make a national push on water, similar to sanitation or the more recent nascent attempt on health?

For some reason, policy makers in India have consistently failed to recognise the key importance of water for the sustainability of India’s growth process and its vital significance in the lives and livelihoods of millions. This has to urgently change.

There has been enough pushback from citizens who are enduring water stress. Are these making any qualitative difference and do they offer some way forward?

Citizens efforts are vitally important but at best they are exemplars for government of the direction national policy must take.

A committee chaired by you in 2016 had recommended a slew of water-related reforms, including the setting up of a National Water Commission. Has there been any progress?

Whenever I presented the proposals, whether to the Ministry of Water Resources, the Niti Aayog or the Prime Minister’s Office, the response I got was overwhelmingly positive, much more positive, for example, than when I was a member of the Planning Commission. Even so, the proposals have not moved forward due to the extraordinary resistance from vested interests within the Central Water Commission, who exercise an almost mystifying power over water policy in India. It gives me no joy to say this but I am afraid this has to do with the political economy of corruption in India.

This is also the reason why despite spending more than Rs400,000 crore on major and medium dam projects in India, we have a recurring and intensifying crisis of water. Trillions of litres of water stored in our dams is not reaching the farmers for whom it is meant. Unless we reform the management of our irrigation commands, this problem will remain. We need to move towards participatory irrigation management and hand over the management of these commands to Water User Associations of farmers. Wherever we have done this, much success has been achieved. These examples need to be scaled up.

Do you think India has had a serious reckoning with the condition of its groundwater resources?

Sustainable groundwater management is the single most important water reform we need to urgently undertake since groundwater is, by far, India’s most important source of water. India is the largest consumer of groundwater, way ahead of even China, which is in second place. During my tenure in the Planning Commission, we initiated the National Aquifer Management Program (NAQUIM), the largest such program ever undertaken in human history.

But over the years, even as groundwater has grown in importance, the central and state groundwater boards have been consistently shorn of human resource capacity. We need a large scale network of partnerships with academic institutions and civil society organisations in order to implement NAQUIM, which seeks to both measure and manage aquifers.

The heads of three global agencies warned Wednesday of the risk of a worldwide ""food shortage"" if authorities fail to manage the ongoing coronavirus crisis properly. Many governments around the world have put their populations on lockdown causing severe slow-downs in international trade and food supply chains.

Panic buying by people going into confinement has already demonstrated the fragility of supply chains as supermarket shelves emptied in many countries.

""Uncertainty about food availability can spark a wave of export restrictions, creating a shortage on the global market,"" said the joint text signed by Qu Dongyu, head of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roberto Azevedo, director of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

""In the midst of the COVID-19 lockdowns, every effort must be made to ensure that trade flows as freely as possible, specially to avoid food shortage(s)"" from developing, they said in their statement.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""When acting to protect the health and well-being of their citizens, countries should ensure that any trade-related measures do not disrupt the food supply chain,"" they added.

Over the longer term confinement orders and travel restrictions risk causing disruptions in agricultural production due to the unavailability of agricultural labour and the inability to get food to markets.

""Such disruptions including hampering the movement of agricultural and food industry workers and extending border delays for food containers, result in the spoilage of perishables and increasing food waste,"" said the three leaders.

They also stressed the need to protect employees engaged in food production, processing and distribution, both for their own health and that of others, as well as to maintain food supply chains.

""It is at times like these that more, not less, international cooperation is essential,"" they said.

""We must ensure that our response to COVID-19 does not unintentionally create unwarranted shortages of essential items and exacerbate hunger and malnutrition.""

https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/imf-global-debt-record-usd-164-trillion-india-praised-right-policies/story/275209.html,"The world is drowning in debt like never before. According to the IMF, global debt, public and private alike, hit a record $164 trillion in 2016 - almost 225 per cent of the world's economic output - up 8 per cent from 2015. Debt-to-GDP ratios in the advanced economies are at levels not seen since World War II, while the same for emerging market and middle-income countries have hit levels last seen during the 1980s debt crisis. To ram home the bad news, ""the world is now 12 per cent of GDP deeper in debt than the previous peak in 2009"", as the latest Fiscal Monitor report put it.

According to Vitor Gaspar, Director, IMF Fiscal Affairs Department, which prepared the report, most of the global debt is in advanced economies, at 105 per cent of GDP on average. But in the past decade, emerging market economies have been responsible for most of the increase. Debt-to-GDP ratios for the latter in 2017 reached almost 50 per cent and are expected to continue on an upward trend. ""One-fifth of emerging market and middle-income economies had debt above 70 per cent of GDP in 2017, similar to levels in the early 2000s in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. Among low-income developing countries, 20 per cent now boast debt above 60 per cent of GDP, compared with almost none in 2012,"" said the report.

""Underpinning debt dynamics for all countries are large primary deficits, which reached record levels in the case of emerging market and developing economies,"" it added. Here's why high government debt and deficits are cause for concern:

It can make countries vulnerable to a sudden tightening of global financing conditions, which could disrupt market access and put economic activity in jeopardy.

Past experience shows that countries can be subject to large unexpected shocks to public debt-to-GDP levels, which would exacerbate rollover risk. Furthermore, IMF has previously established that fiscal risks can be highly correlated with each other, with a distinct bunching of contingent liability realizations during crisis periods.

It can hinder a government's ability to implement a strong fiscal policy response to support the economy in the event of a downturn. Historical experience shows that a weak fiscal position increases the depth and duration of recession-such as in the aftermath of a financial crisis.

Arguably, high debt can also result in lower growth because it can crowd out private investment and create uncertainty about higher future distortionary taxation.



Against this backdrop consider that as per IMF data, India's general government debt (as a percentage of GDP) has been pegged at 70.2 per cent for 2017, up 2 per cent since 2012. In fact, it boasted the second highest debt, after Brazil, in the Emerging Market and Middle-Income Economies category. But the figure is projected to steadily go down here on, from 68.9 per cent this year to 61.4 per cent by 2023. ""The debt level is relatively high, but the authorities are planning to bring it down over the medium term with the right policies,"" said Abdel Senhadji, Deputy Director, IMF Fiscal Affairs Department, at a press conference, adding that India is planning to continue with the consolidation in the current fiscal year and over the medium term. According to the IMF, India's debt ratio projection for 2023, along with a fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent by 2019-20, ""are appropriate"".

China slammed

In contrast, China's government debt to GDP ratio stood much lower at 47.8 per cent in 2017. However, the IMF report holds the country responsible for a whopping 43 per cent of the global debt increase since 2007, calling it ""a driving force"". The main concern ""has to do with the level and pace of accumulation of overall debt, private and public. So, the control over the debt level - in particular, the rhythm of debt accumulation - is a major challenge for the Chinese economy,"" said Gasper. According to IMF data, China's general government debt (as a percentage of GDP) is expected to balloon from 47.8 per cent in 2017 to 65.5 per cent by 2023.

Dismal outlook for the US

The projections for the US are similarly dismal. ""In the US, the revised tax code and the two-year budget agreement provide additional fiscal stimulus to the economy. These measures will give rise to overall deficit above $1 trillion over the next three years, and that corresponds to more than 5 per cent of the US GDP,"" said Gasper, adding, ""Debt is projected to increase from 108 per cent in 2017 to 117 per cent of GDP in 2023. If tax cuts with sunset provisions are not allowed to lapse, public debt would climb even higher.""

Thankfully, the outlook for the world at large is a lot more positive - the IMF forecasts indicate that debt-to-GDP ratios would come down over the next three to five years in most countries. This, of course, hinges on them delivering fully on their policy commitments. So the report calls out for immediate decisive action on the part of nations to strengthen fiscal buffers and advance policies/reforms to reduce vulnerabilities, taking full advantage of the recent broad-based pickup in economic activity. ""Countries are advised to avoid procyclical fiscal policies that exacerbate economic fluctuations and ratchet up public debt,"" said Gasper.

Incidentally, the report also gives a thumbs up to Aadhaar, the constitutional validity of which is currently being debated in the Supreme Court. ""Digitalization can improve financial management and ultimately the efficiency of public spending... Biometric technology to identify and authenticate individuals can help reduce leakages and improve coverage of social programs. With more than 1.2 billion registered citizens in India's biometric identification system, Aadhaar, the country stands out as a leader in this area,"" it said. Significantly, the IMF also underscored that digitization is no panacea, and the report made clear that ""governments must address multiple political, social, and institutional weakness and manage digital risks"".

Most of the companies which are part of the index are bluechip names and are leaders of their respective sectors. With the recent fall seen in the markets, many of the blue-chip names are trading at multi-year lows.

The question now is – are these stocks good long-term buys? Moneycontrol spoke to experts on this and they said, not all stocks which have hit their 52-week lows are long term buys, but only a select few.

Some of the stocks which are going through a turmoil are due to structural or industry-specific issues, hence, it does make sense to avoid while some of them are under pressure due to institutional selling.

It makes a valid case for investors who are looking at an investment horizon of 2-3 years. Because the volatility is likely to continue amid the Coronavirus outbreak at least till the time a medically approved vaccine comes to light.

“Investor, looking to build long term portfolio, can start investing in blue chips companies such as Reliance Industries, HDFC twins, Bajaj finance, Asian paints, Colgate, Britannia, Dabur, L&T, Axis Bank, Titan, Cipla, Infosys and TCS which are available at a reasonable valuation,” Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Though we do not rule out further downside in the stock price due to on-going virus concern and its impact on the economy, we would advise buying these fundamentally sound stocks in a phased manner for healthy returns over the next 2-3 years,” he said.

Experts do advise caution on the part of investors before making a buy or a sell decision. Positions in quality stocks can be made in a staggered manner keeping in view the risk profile of investor(s) in order to avoid opportunity loss, suggest experts.

“Markets are in grip of risk aversion due to the spread of coronavirus pandemic. Though the stocks have corrected significantly from their highs, the uncertainty involved in the markets has not abated given the escalation of new cases and causalities due to the virus esp. in the US and Europe,” Pankaj Bobade, Fundamental Research head, Axis Securities Limited told Moneycontrol.

“If one has more than 3 years of investment horizon, one can look at investing in the corrected blue chips in staggered manner thereby averaging the cost of acquisition,” he said.

https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/basic-income-towards-a-path-of-resilience/1929720/,"India has been given time to prepare, or in the jargon of the moment, to get ahead of the curve before the death toll mounts, and the economic slump heaps further misery on people.

A hundred years ago, the Spanish flu swept the world, killing over 40 million. But, the world economy did not suffer from a depression. Paradoxically, while we hope that the Coronavirus will kill far fewer, the ensuing economic depression will, on current trends, be much worse. If so, there will be many more deaths.

The main reason is that the economic crisis has been waiting for some time to happen. The pandemic is like a trigger. The global economic system has evolved into global rentier capitalism, not anything close to free-market capitalism. With rentier capitalism, more and more of the income and wealth flow to the owners of assets-physical, financial and so-called intellectual property. The share of income going to people who work and labour has been falling across the world.

A new class has emerged, the precariat, consisting of millions who are not in the informal economy as traditionally understood or in what the left likes to call the proletariat, but who are deeply insecure, with low, fluctuating and uncertain incomes. They are living on the edge, mostly with chronic debt. One downturn will tip many into the abyss.

This relates to a key difference between 1920 and 2020. A hundred years ago, the US economy was able to bounce back because the private debt was less than 50% of national income, corporate debt was insignificant, and the size of the financial sector was not large relative to the real economy. Just before the pandemic struck this year, private debt was over 150% of the US national income, and corporate debt was 73% of GDP. In Britain, Japan and many other countries, private and corporate debt were also at record levels.

This means that the major economies entered the pandemic in an extremely fragile state. The negative multiplier effects of a small downturn will be huge, and this is not going to be small. Moreover, the global system is grossly over-financialised, with finance accounting for over 350% of American GDP, and over 300% of Britain’s. Expect the stock market crashes of recent weeks to be a harbinger of worse.

What we are confronting is the biggest global demand shock in history. It requires brave and transformative economic policy. While central banks and the international financial agencies will resort to fancy monetary instruments and will do their utmost to prop up corporations and financial markets, it is what happens to ordinary people that will matter most.

We should presume that the Indian government is not complacent or timid. But, a key principle must be kept in mind. Whatever the delaying effect of lock-downs, deaths due to the pandemic and to the ensuing economic downturn will be much higher if ordinary people are not given the resources to be resilient. Indeed, the slogan should be: Rescue, Resilience, and Revival.

Having worked on it for over 30 years, I am convinced that the optimum way to provide resilience is through a basic income system. We are fortunate in this respect. We piloted that system in villages of Madhya Pradesh and west Delhi, and we know that it works, and is feasible in India. Our pilots showed that even in what might be called ‘normal times’, a community-wide basic income system improves health, nutrition, schooling and production, and induces local multiplier effects of the sort most urgently needed in the crisis. It is not inflationary because the increased local demand induces increased local supply of basic goods and services.

With numerous rural-urban migrants flocking back to their villages, imagine the potential of providing every man and every woman with Rs 500 a month. We know this is not much but is still a little more. As we found, the emancipatory value is greater than the monetary value. Just as they should avoid paternalistic schemes such as universal grain distribution, a recipe for chaos, corruption, waste and inequities, the authorities should avoid targeting or selectivity through means-tests. They fail in the best of times, not reaching those in need. The basic income must be paid to every usual resident in every community across the land. It can be collected back, as a tax, from the rich in due course.

As other economists have argued, a short-term rise in public budget deficits in current conditions is fiscally good. The cost in lives and economic loss of not going in the direction recommended would be many times that cost. But, expenditure switching is also essential, since the existing subsidy state is bloated, chronically inefficient and shockingly inequitable. The government should take advantage of the crisis to combine payment of basic income with fiscal reform that would be much harder in more normal conditions.

Several interesting schemes are trying to mobilise private money as donations to such initiatives as the PMNRF and PM CARES. Those are likely to be politicised, and even if they were genuinely philanthropic, there would be widespread suspicion that they have ulterior motives. Better for the affluent to allocate money to help legitimise a basic income system by making a start in randomly chosen districts, setting an example that the state and central governments could follow with conviction.

Perhaps, what is needed is a variant of the Bombay Plan, in which political leaders and leading industrialists and other affluent persons could come together to institute a policy that could set an example for the whole world. There is the technology to be able to identify everybody and deliver basic incomes (it could even induce much more documentation). Above all, there are potentially millions of lives to be saved.

The market does not look good. It has been on a weak footing. The foundation of what is happening right now was laid six months back. Many of the technical charts that we follow have been negative for a while now. The technical indicators have not been in sync with the price action but because the Nifty had such a great run on account of a handful of stocks, we never questioned the technical indicators till Nifty hit 12,300-12,400 levels.In light of the developments of the past week, it does seem that this is not a plain vanilla correction. It is a short term downtrend wherein the markets will continue to make a series of lower tops and lower bottoms and this can continue for many weeks and maybe even many months.The market participants are used to seeing indices correct or turn around to go back to making new highs. This might not happen right now because when you look at the momentum on the way down, and the volumes, some of the larger stocks are clocking in bad days. And this is an indication that there is a big shift happening.The markets are also going through collateral damage given what is happening around the world. This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. The first pointer to work with is the budget day low of around 11,620. You could see some stopover demand there but we believe that eventually this market is headed towards that zone of 11,300 to 11,350 and maybe even to 11,100 and this has been our working view for the last one month. All rallies will find a lot of resistance, so the upside is clearly capped to the 11,900 area. And because there are too many sectors participating on the way down, Bank Nifty which was an outperformer in the last couple of days is only now sitting up for the largest decline. We would not be surprised if Bank Nifty loses about 10 per cent from these levels.I would be more bearish on capital goods, the reason being in the good times when Nifty got close to levels of 12,400 level, the stocks from this sector did not participate. And now as the markets are going through a difficult phase, capital goods is clearly one of the biggest underperformers. Larsen & Toubro is a great example because it did absolutely nothing in the last three months. Many of the top capital good stocks are setting up for a much bigger breakdown that could lead to 10 per cent to 15 per cent downside for the index and for most of the stocks.Autos, well they had a lovely run. They moved up 30 per cent from the lows of last August, September but the manner in which some of them have just come off in the last 10 days that does not look heartening at all. In this environment, the weak is getting weaker, and the cheap is getting cheaper and this trend will continue on for the next many weeks. We will have to really review in the last week of March but at least for the next four to six weeks, capital goods, FMCG, auto, metals, banking are a complete avoid and the only two spaces that we like are IT and healthcare. We believe one can hide is chemicals and insurance too. So, these four pockets will outperform but everything else in the market looks quite bleak.In the banking space, for the last year, year and a half just one stock – HDFC Bank acted like Pied Piper. So, when this stock did well, the Bank Nifty did well and because the Bank Nifty did well it helped Nifty.Some of these top-performing stocks of the last 18 months may witness some downside and if that were to happen, then the Bank Nifty will take a hit. We are working with an immediate target of about 29,700 which was around the budget day low, and once that gets violated we would not be surprised if Bank Nifty goes down to 28,900 and eventually 28,000.A possible 2,000 point fall on the Bank Nifty is likely and some of the top names in the space, apart from ICICI Bank which has broken out of a 10-year consolidation, look weak.PSU banking is in terrible shape; most stocks are making 52-week lows and there are no signs of bottoming out. We have recommended our subscribers to stay away from this space because you really do not know where this is going to end in terms of its downtrend.","market does not look good. it has been on a weak footing, says nirmal. markets are going through collateral damage given what is happening around the world. nifty is now sitting up for the largest decline. nifty is a short term downtrend. nifty is a good example of how the market is going to react to the global crisis.",Negative

While Covid-19 would significantly impact the business in the short term (say two months), we expect it to bounce back thereafter, led by pent-up demand and a packed line-up of movies. We cut FY2020-21E Ebitda estimates by 10-23% and retain FY2022E estimates.

Sharp 40% correction from peak presents an opportunity to buy this stock at an attractive valuation.

Almost all state governments have ordered complete shutdown of cinemas in order to contain Covid-19 outbreak. Subsequently, producers have pushed back movie releases and production studios have halted ongoing shoots. These restrictions could continue for a few weeks. We assess potential ST impact of Covid-19 on PVR’s financials assuming a complete shutdown for two months (base case). Exhibit 1 shows break-up of PVR’s cost structure. Film hire costs, F&B COGS, electricity are variable costs. Employee costs (permanent + contractual workforce) and other expenses (travel costs, repair & maintenance, advertising and other G&A expenses) are semi-variable in nature. Even as rental cost is largely fixed (fixed rent or MG + revenue share), several lease contracts have a provision

for partial/complete waiver in situations such as this.

As per our estimate, PVR would incur cost of Rs 750 mn/month in the event of a complete shutdown. Cash inflow would be nil during this period and revenues would be booked at Rs 150 mn/month (amortization of BookMyShow/Paytm convenience fee deal). We estimate Ebitda loss of Rs 600 mn/month (Rs 750 on cash basis) and cash loss (including interest expense) of Rs 850 mn/month. PVR has utilized available W-cap facility of about Rs 1.5 bn and increased cash-levels to about Rs 2-2.5 bn. Net debt as of date is about Rs 9.2 bn. We expect a strong bounce back in demand post Covid-19 led by pent-up demand, and packed line-up of movies (Q4FY20/Q1FY21 releases deferred would be scheduled during Q2-Q4FY21). Further, we believe that PVR’s performance is largely linked to content quality and weak macro has modest impact on the operating performance. Given this, we expect footfalls to largely recover post Covid-19 even in case of some incremental weakness in macro. That said, we note that advertising revenue growth could decelerate if economy slows down further. We like PVR for its thought leadership, premium location presence and branding, leadership in monetization and profitability, and execution track record. We value the stock at 11X FY2022E EV/Ebitda (excluding Ind-AS 116). We have cut our FY2020-21E Ebitda estimates by 10-23% as we model complete shutdown of about two months (base case).","we upgrade PVR to ‘buy’ from ‘reduce’ with FV of Rs 1,800 (Rs 1,850) valuing it at 11X FY2022E EV/Ebitda (unchanged) we cut FY2020-21E Ebitda estimates by 10-23% and retain FY2022E estimates.

In broad terms are we going to continue to harm children to protect vulnerable people, or not?""Health minister Matt Hancock has set a goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month, a tenfold increase that industry leaders have questioned due to shortages of specialist chemicals and testing kits. It is also considering immunity certificates.Medley said the antibody tests could help but were not working so far.Separately the government said it would free prisoners who were deemed to be low risk and were within weeks of release.Prime Minister Johnson, who has been in self-isolation after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, said he would invite opposition party leaders to a briefing next week with Britain's chief medical officer and scientific adviser.""As party leaders we have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency,"" he said.","government has ordered people to stay home unless absolutely essential to venture out. experts question whether the shuttering of the economy will cost more lives. a quarter of a million people could die from the coronavirus. a second senior government adviser fears the country has painted itself into a corner. a ten-year target of 100,000 tests per day is set for this month.",Negative

https://www.financialexpress.com/market/india-sees-pe-vc-deals-worth-45-billion-in-2019-highest-inflow-in-10-years-report/1957707/,"India continued to be the second largest deal market in the Asia-Pacific region in 2019 with over 1,000 private equity and venture capital pacts valued at USD 45 billion – the highest in the last decade, a report by Bain & Company said on Wednesday.

Private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investment in the country rose to its 10-year peak primarily due to the increasing number of large deals greater than USD 100 million as well as an increase in their average deal size, the firm’s India Private Equity Report 2020 said.

The report, developed in partnership with the Indian Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (IVCA), also found that exit value in 2019 decreased, finishing at nearly USD 13 billion against USD 17 billion in 2018 (excluding Flipkart’s exit).

This was still the third-highest for the last decade. The dip over last year was led by a decrease in the number of exits from 265 to 200.

India-focused dry powder (marketable securities that are highly liquid and considered cash-like) will remain healthy, but a potential reduction in investments could occur in the first half of 2020, accompanied by a price correction across the board, the report noted.

India continued to be the second largest private equity deal market in Asia-Pacific (APAC) with the most growth in the region, it said adding that India’s share of the APAC deal market increased to nearly 25 per cent in 2019, and the investment value was about 70 per cent higher than in 2018 and nearly 110 per cent higher than the previous five-year average.

Meanwhile, China’s PE market witnessed a decline in both deal value and volume due to trade war concerns, social unrest and stringent Renminbi fundraising regulations, the report said.

Of the top 15 deals in India – which constituted more than 35 per cent of the total investment value in 2019 – five were in real estate; three in IT and ITES; and the rest across banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), telecommunications, energy and consumer technology.

Notable large investments in 2019 included stakes in Reliance Jio Infratel, Pipeline Infrastructure, Axis Bank, GMR Airports, GVK Airport Holdings and Paytm. Real estate and infrastructure, telecom, IT and ITES, and BFSI contributed to more than 90 per cent of the growth in investment value.

BFSI investments were fuelled by deals in banks as well as non-banking financial companies with investments of USD 8.4 billion, while consumer technology attracted USD 7.7 billion of investments in 2019. Almost half of these investments were in vertical e-tailers/marketplaces and fintech companies.

“From an investment perspective, we will likely see a short-term dip in investment activity with COVID-19, as already evidenced globally. However, this imminent price correction across the board will present an investment opportunity.

”Investors need to triage their portfolio and take actions to adapt to the changes in the economy which includes taking immediate actions to ensure business continuity and plan for value creation to retool their businesses for the future,” Arpan Sheth, Partner at Bain & Company and one of the lead authors of the report, said.

He added that the market disruption caused by COVID-19 could lead to growth in select pockets such as e-commerce, enterprise technology, healthcare, and on-demand services.

Like previous years, the total share of buyouts rose with an increase in growth and late-stage investments. These featured a few large individual buyouts like Reliance Jio Infratel (USD 3.5 billion) and Pipeline Infrastructure (USD 1.8 billion), the report said.

With recent investments from global players, competitive intensity in the Indian investment market has progressively increased, with 662 active funds in 2017-19 compared with 553 funds in 2015-17, it added.

The report pointed out that the COVID-19 pandemic signals the possibility of a significant impact due to increased global interconnectedness and the virus’ high spread rate.

India is beginning to face the impact of COVID-19, with major import and export destinations impacted as well as the stock market which has taken a hit in recent months, it said.

The report said, based on global financial crisis experience, deals invested during or after a downturn tend to do well.

Overall APAC-focused fundraising slowed considerably, dropping to about USD 80 billion in 2019 from nearly USD 200 billion in 2017. This was largely driven by weakening Renminbi-based funds, reflecting the Chinese government’s tightened restrictions on PE investments.

A majority of investors expect the fundraising environment to be more challenging in the next 12 months, driven by record-setting previous years, cautiousness of a slow economy and limited partnerships being highly selective with increasing competition, the report said.

“A strong exit track record will be important for future investments. Having seen record investments last year, Software as a Service and cross-sector technologies will be the attractive opportunities for investors in the future,” Sriwatsan Krishnan, Partner at Bain & Company and a co-author of the report, said.

With an unpredictable public market, strategic sales became the preferred mode of exit, accounting for about 50 per cent of exit volume.","private equity investment in the country rose to its 10-year peak. exit value in 2019 decreased, finishing at nearly USD 13 billion against USD 17 billion in 2018 (excluding Flipkart’s exit) this was still the third-highest for the last decade. of the top 15 deals in India – which constituted more than 35 per cent of the total investment value in 2019 – five were in real estate; three in IT and ITES; and the rest across banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), telecommunications",Negative
https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/textile-processing-industry-will-not-be-able-to-recommence-operations/1941672/,"Even though the Gujarat government has granted permission to recommence operations, the Ahmedabad-based Rs 25,000 crore textile processing industry will not be able to function as there is no demand (domestic and international) of processed textile in wake of Covid-19 pandemic.

Till March 24, 2020, over 300 textile processing units situated in and around Ahmedabad used to process on an average nearly 1.5 crore metre cloths on daily basis. With announcement of nationwide lockdown, this highly labour intensive industry suddenly ceased.

“It is not easy to resume work. Markets across the globe are almost closed. Even if some demand generates in near future, it would take at least a fortnight to make a textile processing unit to function normally. Migrant labourers have left for their native places and most of the local labourers residing in red zones declared by authorities. Hence, they wouldn’t be able to leave their areas till further orders,” says Nitin Thakker, president of Ahmedabad Textile Processors Association (ATPS) adding that in such situation it would be impossible to run a unit with immediate effect.

Already owners of textile processing units are under severe pressure to pay their instalments of loans, salaries of their employees and contract labours and other fixed expenditures, said Thakker, who is also member of a committee formed by Union ministry of textile for the development of textile sector in the country. According to him, currently people’s priorities are food and medicine, textile and apparels would come later and hence there wouldn’t be any demand in near future.

The highly labour intensive textile processing sector of Ahmedabad provides direct employment to nearly 1 lakh people and indirect employment to more than three lakh people. He further said that it would be extremely difficult to follow social distancing guidelines of government in the case of textile processing units as textile processing requires large number of labourers.

Crores of rupees have been stuck as these textile processors have supplied processed textile all across the country on credit and due to sudden lockdown purchasers are not able to pay them. “We can’t blame on buyers as they haven’t been neither able to do value addition on processed textile or sell it to their buyers. Hence they don’t have money to pay us. Nobody knows when this vicious chain would end,” said an owner of a large textile processing units, whose Rs 75 crore have been stuck due to lockdown requesting anonymity.","the Gujarat government has granted permission to recommence operations. but the industry will not be able to function as there is no demand (domestic and international) of processed textile in wake of Covid-19 pandemic. with announcement of nationwide lockdown, this highly labour intensive industry suddenly ceased. owners of textile processing units are already under severe pressure to pay instalments of loans, salaries of their employees and contract labours.",Negative

The Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc across financial markets. Even the hitherto steady fixed income market is shaken. Investors are concerned about credit quality and liquidity of the underlying instruments. In such unbridled times, we review the banking and PSU (public sector undertaking) category, which invest 80% of their assets in debt instruments of banks, PSUs, public financial institutions (PFIs) and municipal bodies.

Better credit & liquidity profile

These funds primarily invest in top-rated instruments of the debt market—bonds and debentures issued by banks, PSUs and PFIs—thus providing a better credit profile for investment compared to most other mutual fund categories.

Credit quality comparison among debt funds ranked in the CRISIL Mutual Fund Ranking of March 2020 shows that banking and PSU funds have predominately invested in top-rated papers versus most other categories with portfolio average maturity above one year. Average exposure of these funds to AAA rated papers stood at 92% in April 2020. Exposure to similar AAA papers stood at 53% for medium duration funds, 72% for dynamic bond funds, 84% for short duration funds and 91% for medium to long duration funds, while long duration and corporate bond funds had higher exposure at 97% and 98%, respectively.

In addition to having higher investments in top-rated papers, the category had the least amount of investments in securities that had ‘negative’ or ‘watch negative’ outlook by rating agencies. It had just 1.4% of exposure to such securities as of the latest portfolio disclosure (April 2020). The next best were medium to long duration funds with 1.5% exposure to such securities, while credit risk funds had the highest exposure of over 27.4%.

Further, analysis of debt mutual fund portfolio liquidity of corporate bonds based on CRISIL’s internal model that factors trades and spreads of issuers show that the category also has relatively high liquidity in the underlying portfolio, enabling the fund manager to rebalance the portfolio more efficiently. Analysis of their portfolio for month of April 2020 reveals that banking and PSU funds enjoyed the average exposure at 94.6% to liquid assets (includes liquid corporate bond issuers, sovereign papers and cash & equivalents) only marginally lower than long duration funds (95.3% exposure).

Among other similar debt categories, medium to long duration funds had 82.4% exposure, corporate bond funds had 81.9%, dynamic bond funds had 72.7%, short duration funds stood at 71.4%, medium duration funds had 51.2% and credit risk funds had 25.3% of their portfolio in similar liquid assets.

Performance analysis

The category has also shown encouraging performance, beating all other categories analysed viz., corporate bond, credit risk, dynamic bond, medium duration, medium to long duration and short duration funds in 1, 3, 5 and 7- year periods ended May 22, 2020 with returns of 11.83%, 8.32%, 8.40% and 8.53% respectively. In the latest six-month period till May 22, the category average returns were 5.30%, marginally lower than medium to long duration funds which benefitted from the interest rate easing and gave 5.67% returns during the period.

Fitment

Investors with a low risk appetite looking for a relatively safe investment avenue can consider banking and PSU debt funds. However, these are mark-to-market products and exposed to market risk. Go for analysis of personal risk-return profile, portfolio attributes of the scheme, the fund house’s track record before investing.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Several Air India passengers flying out of New Jersey’s Newark Liberty International Airport have complained of being bitten by bed bugs while in flight.

According to a report by Hindustan Times, Toneskar said the seats were ‘infested’ and they had to downgrade to economy just to escape the bugs. The economy seats were allegedly damaged and most facilities were inoperable.

Air India reached out to Toneskar, after he lodged an official complaint, and offered an apology, assuring him that corrective measures would be taken.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/turkey-says-us-waging-economic-war-lira-weakens-2874341.html,"The lira slid on Thursday after Turkey accused the United States of waging ""economic war"" amid a bitter standoff between the NATO allies over the fate of a Christian pastor detained by Ankara.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman said Washington must respect the legal process concerning the pastor, Andrew Brunson, whose trial in Turkey on terrorism charges has infuriated US President Donald Trump.

The lira dipped as far as 6.1350 against the dollar and was 0.7 percent weaker on the day at 6.0785 at 1200 GMT. The dollar was boosted by US Federal Reserve minutes indicating it would raise interest rates in September.

The lira is down 37 percent this year, with the crisis in Turkish-US ties exacerbating losses prompted by concerns about Erdogan's influence on monetary policy. He says interest rates are the ""mother and father of all evil"" and opposes hiking them.

Economists said Turkey had still to convince investors it was ready to take measures needed to shore up its economy.

""The problems of Turkey are not fixed,"" said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities. ""There is not one single structural solution or reform that has been advanced or detailed by the local authorities.""

Maggio added that lira volatility had increased due to thin trading volumes as Turkish markets are closed all week for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha.

Erdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, told Reuters overnight that comments by Trump's national security adviser showed the United States was targeting Turkey's economy.

John Bolton told Reuters that Turkey had made a ""big mistake"" in not freeing Brunson, and was sceptical about $15 billion of investment support from Qatar, saying it was ""utterly insufficient to have an impact on Turkey's economy"".

""(Bolton's) statement is proof that the Trump administration is targeting a NATO ally as part of an economic war,"" Kalin said.

""The Trump administration has established that it intends to use trade, tariffs and sanctions to start a global trade war.""

""RESTRICTIVE AND PUNITIVE""

Until Kalin's statement, Turkish officials had been silent about comments on Turkey this week by Trump and Bolton. Trump told Reuters on Monday he would make no concessions to Ankara in return for Brunson's release.

Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for two decades, has been detained for 21 months and is now under house arrest. He denies the charges against him.

Trump, who counts evangelical Christians among his core voter base, has doubled tariffs on metal imports from Turkey, prompting Ankara to raise tariffs on U.S. car, alcohol and tobacco imports by the same amount.

Ankara has also initiated a WTO dispute complaint on the tariffs.

""Turkey will protect its national interests on every platform and work with the rest of the world against restrictive and punitive measures,"" Kalin said, adding that Qatar's support had had a positive impact on markets.

""The steps we have taken to prevent an assault on the Turkish lira yielded positive results"" and the Finance Ministry and other institutions will continue to ""take precautions and protect our economy"", Kalin added.

A German government source said the International Monetary Fund could help Turkey weather its currency crisis, but Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, Erdogan's son-in-law, has said Ankara has no plans to go to the IMF.

Cemil Ertem, Erdogan's chief economic adviser, reinforced that message on Thursday, saying Turkey must deepen economic and trade ties with the European Union and other countries.

""Let alone the IMF, not one crumb of the IMF mentality must come through our door after this. If it does then we will face a real collapse and crisis,"" Ertem wrote in Milliyet newspaper, describing the ""attack"" on Turkey's economy as a ""fantastic opportunity"" for all emerging economies.

The analyst Maggio highlighted market concerns that Turkey's central bank has not been hiking interest rates despite double-digit inflation and the ailing lira.

""They just squeezed liquidity out of the market but now they have started to reduce that squeeze, which is removing the support the lira received,"" said Maggio. ""I would be very surprised to see a sustained rally in the lira.""

In his comments to Reuters, Kalin also said Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a banker at Turkey's state-owned Halkbank, had been unjustly convicted in the United States for taking part in a scheme to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Atilla was sentenced to 32 months in jail in May.

Kerala had sent its suggestions in writing and Vijayan had deputed Chief Secretary Tom Jose to represent the state.

Reports say that only seven states are allowed to speak during the video meet with the Prime Minister today and Kerala was not among those seven states. Kerala CM had the opportunity to speak in the PM’s second interaction held on April 11. For today’s meeting, the states who have no permission to speak have been asked to submit in writing what they want to convey to the Centre.

Monday’s meeting is the fourth such interaction with chief ministers since March 22 when he discussed the coronavirus situation and steps taken to limit the spread of the virus. It was on March 24 that the Prime Minister had announced the nationwide lockdown to control the spread of the virus.

Today’s meeting comes as the second phase of the nationwide lockdown enters its final week. While the Centre and states are likely to discuss a graded exit plan from May 4, there are also concerns over the impact that this opening of the economy would have on the spread of COVID-19. Some states have already recommended that the lockdown be extended beyond May 3, while many others have said they will go by whatever the Centre decides.

Kerala has so far reported four coronavirus-related deaths and 458 positive cases. The deadly virus has infected over 30 lakh people in the world.

Even as states begin to reopen for business, a further 2.4 million workers joined the nation’s unemployment rolls last week, and there is growing concern among economists that many of the lost jobs are gone for good.

The Labor Department’s report of new jobless claims, released Thursday, brought the total to 38.6 million since mid-March, when the coronavirus outbreak forced widespread shutdowns.

While workers and their employers have expressed optimism that most of the joblessness will be temporary, many who are studying the pandemic’s impact are increasingly worried about the employment situation.

“I hate to say it, but this is going to take longer and look grimmer than we thought,” Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, said of the path to recovery.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Bloom is a co-author of an analysis that estimates 42% of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss.

“Firms intend to hire these people back,” he said, referring to a recent survey of businesses done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. “But we know from the past that these aspirations often don’t turn out to be true.”

The precariousness of the path ahead was underscored Thursday by the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell. “We are now experiencing a whole new level of uncertainty, as questions only the virus can answer complicate the outlook,” he said in remarks for delivery at an online forum.

The economy that does come back is likely to look quite different from the one that closed. If social distancing rules become the new normal, causing thinner crowds in restaurants, theaters and stores, at sports arenas, and on airplanes, then fewer workers will be required.

Large companies already expect more of their workers to continue to work remotely and say they plan to reduce their real estate footprint, which will reduce the foot traffic that feeds nearby restaurants, shops, nail salons and other businesses.

Concerns about working in close quarters and too much social interaction could also accelerate the trend toward automation, some economists say.

New jobs are being created, mostly at low wages — for delivery drivers, warehouse workers and cleaners. But many more jobs will vanish.

“I think we’re in for a very long haul,” Bloom said.

Torsten Slok, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities, agreed that the government’s latest report pointed to lasting job losses. Even with states reopening, “the hemorrhaging has continued,” he said.

“I fear that maybe there is something more fundamental going on,” particularly in occupations most affected by social distancing rules, Slok added. He expects the official jobless rate for May to approach 20%, up from the 14.7% reported by the Labor Department for April.

A household survey from the Census Bureau released Wednesday offered further evidence of the widespread pain: 47% of adults said they or a member of their household had lost employment income since mid-March. Nearly 40% expected the loss to continue over the next four weeks.

Nonetheless, Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, knocked down the idea of extending unemployment benefits. “I do not believe that more government spending is going to give us a strong and durable recovery,” he said Thursday at an event sponsored by The Washington Post.

Emergency relief and expanded unemployment benefits that Congress approved in late March have helped tide households over. Roughly three-quarters of people who are eligible for a $1,200 stimulus payment from the federal government have received it, according to the Treasury Department.

Workers who have successfully applied for unemployment benefits are getting the extra $600 weekly supplement from the federal government, and most states have finally begun to carry out the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which extends benefits to freelancers, self-employed workers and others who don’t routinely qualify. The total number of new pandemic insurance claims reported, though, was inflated by nearly 1 million because of a data entry mistake from Massachusetts, according to the state’s Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development.

Mistakes, lags in reporting and processing, and the weeding out of duplicate claims and reports have clouded the unemployment picture in some places.

What is clear, though, is that many states are still struggling to keep up with the overwhelming demand, drawing desperate complaints from jobless workers who have been waiting two months or more to receive their first benefit check. Indiana, Wyoming, Hawaii and Missouri are among the states with large backlogs of incompletely processed claims. Another is Kentucky, where nearly 1 in 3 workers are unemployed.

The $600 supplement has become a point of contention, drawing criticism from the White House and Republican congressional leaders who object to the notion that some workers — particularly low-wage ones — are getting more money in unemployment benefits than they would on the job. But many have also lost their employer-provided health insurance and other benefits.

Sami Adamson, a freelance scenic artist for theater, events and television shows, received the letter with her login credentials to collect benefits from New Jersey only Monday, more than two months after she first applied.

She said her partner, who is in the same line of work, had filed for jobless benefits in New York and quickly received his payments.

By the time she heard from New Jersey, a design studio had called her for a temporary assignment. She plans to eventually reclaim the lost weeks of benefits, but for now she is helping to make face shields in a large warehouse where assembly-line workers are spaced apart, handling plastic, foam and elastic.

“I don’t think I’ll need aid for the next two or three weeks,” Adamson said, “but I’m not sure too far ahead of that.”

Nearly half of the states have yet to provide the additional 13 weeks of unemployment insurance that the federal government has promised to those who exhausted their state benefits. Workers in Florida — which provides just 12 weeks of benefits, the fewest anywhere — are particularly feeling this pinch. And while several states, including those that pay the average of 26 weeks, have offered additional weeks of coverage during the pandemic, Florida has not.

Small-business owners who were hoping the Paycheck Protection Program would enable them to keep their workers on the payroll contend the program is not operating as intended.

Roy Surdej, who owns Peaches Boutique in Chicago, applied for a loan after he was forced to close and the pandemic eliminated the season’s wave of proms, quinceañeras and graduation celebrations.

Under the program, the loan turns into a grant if he rehires the 100-person staff he had built up in February in anticipation of selling thousands of ruffled, sequined and strappy dresses during the spring rush. But he said that would be impossible, given the income he had lost and the restrictions that continue to preempt social gatherings.

“No way can I qualify for full forgiveness,” said Surdej, who said revenue had dried up. “It’s devastating for us,” he added, saying he had no clue when he would be able to reopen and begin rehiring. “If the government can’t adjust the dates to allow us to use it properly so we can survive, then I won’t use it.”

At the same time, the Congressional Budget Office warned that businesses able to use the Paycheck Protection Program might end up laying off workers when the program expires at the end of June.

Several states have warned workers that they risk losing their benefits if they refuse an offer to work. Federal rules enacted during the pandemic say that workers are not compelled to return to unsafe working conditions, but just what constitutes such conditions is not necessarily clear.

On Tuesday, Democratic senators sent a letter to Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to “clarify the circumstances” so that workers are not “forced to choose between going back to work in unsafe conditions, or continuing to social distance and losing their only source of income.”

Workers with child care responsibilities can stay on unemployment if public schools are closed, but once the term ends, a lack of day care or summer programs is not considered a legitimate reason. Nor are self-imposed quarantines.

Officials can lift stay-at-home and business restrictions, but then what happens?

“There are lingering concerns about health, family situations, kids not in school, relatives who are sick and needing care,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. “There’s going to be a very slow and gradual process of reopening and restoring employment beyond just a declaration from the statehouse or the county seat.”

The MSME and the small businesses sector is going to face problems as their earnings losses are inevitable and in view of that, they may not be able to meet their financial obligations towards vis-a-vis their borrowings. They need a moratorium of a minimum 3-6 months, ideally six months, when all their repayments towards NBFC and banks are deferred.Second, they would look for some cut in interest rates because it will take quite some time to bounce back to their earlier earning levels. The job losses are happening now that the entire cash flow of the small businesses is completely down.So, their earning losses have to be compensated by lower interest rate and the credit line has to be made available so that they can cope up with this kind of unprecedented situation.In the last three to four months, while the government has intervened and DFS has started tracking the disbursement, money was adequately available. While the cost of funds have not gone down much because the discussion with the lender used to be only about the money and not the rate of interest. So, the rate has not come down as such for either housing finance or MSME sectors when an NBFC goes to borrow from the banks.But the National Housing Bank has given a much lower rate to the housing finance companies. That can be a relief to the NBFCs as well as the end users, the MSMEs Our entire team and specifically the collection team engage with the customers because the latter’s businesses come to a sudden halt if they are not able to generate cash flows.

We are taking conservative view but we are trying to help some of the genuine borrowers who are in the grocery, essential supplies business where they need more working capital.We are considering disbursing money to these kinds of customers on a specific case basis. However, our collection team is keeping engaged with the customers for their upcoming repayments asking whether they need any help or if they would not be able to make the payment. We are analyzing our entire portfolio on a risk basis.All the NBFCs and banks see a lot of disbursements lined up in the March because March is the month of highest disbursement for everybody. Of course, growth is going to be stuck. We are not going to grow this month because nobody is on the ground. Our strategy is going to be yes, we are worried on the asset quality side looking at how some of the businesses may not be able to pay their EMIs. They might pay their EMIs partially. There is going to be a spike in delinquency. So let us see how the situation evolves.While we are keeping engaged with our customers, collection has come to a halt. We are worried about this month.

https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/sebi-censures-astrazeneca-pharma-promoter-elliot-group-for-unfair-trade-practices-in-delisting-plan/story/406207.html,"Markets regulator SEBI has strongly ""censured"" Astrazeneca Pharma India Ltd's promoter and Elliot Group for professional misconduct and following unfair trade practises during the company's delisting plan in 2014.

The regulator, in a 65-page order, said that AstraZeneca Pharma India Ltd's (AZPIL) promoter AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals AB Sweden (AZPAB), and Elliott Group, which held 15.52 percent stake in the company, had a 'private arrangement' to sail through the delisting process.

SEBI said it ""strongly censure the noticees (AZPAB and Elliott Group) for displaying such gross professional misconduct and fraudulent trade practice and trying to arrive at a private arrangement amongst them so as to help the company sail through the delisting procedure"".

It further said that the entire procedure was intended to dilute the reverse book building mechanism for discovery of delisting price of the scrip as per stipulations in the SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, thereby jeopardising the interests of retail public shareholders and investors of the company at large.

SEBI came across certain reports stating that the Offer for Sale (OFS) through stock exchange mechanism of shares of AstraZeneca Pharma, carried out by its sole promoter AZPAB in May 2013, was a deliberate strategy to subsequently get the shares of AZPIL delisted at its own convenience.

It was also reported that more than 94 percent of total shares offered through OFS had been subscribed by a group of six Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) who were reportedly extending support to the promoters of AZPIL in the matter of delisting of AZPIL.

The reports also stated that in March 2014, AZPIL had informed the stock exchanges that it received a letter from AZPAB proposing to make voluntary delisting offer to the shareholders of the pharma company.

Following this, the regulator undertook an investigation of OFS exercise carried out by the promoter company of AZPIL and the earlier two attempts in 2004 and 2010 made by the pharma firm to delist its shares from the exchanges.

Elliott Group, through FII sub-accounts, had purchased 15.52 percent shareholding through the OFS. Also, the Group decided to participate in the delisting offer in 2014.

Elliott Associates L.P, Elliott International L.P, Elliot Advisors (HK) Ltd, Elliott Management Corporation, The Liverpool Limited Partnership, Mansfield (Mauritius) Ltd and Suffolk (Mauritius) Ltd were the sub-accounts.

SEBI found that the series of communications exchanged between the representatives of promoter of the company and the Elliott Group conspicuously indicate that the firm's promoter was very pro-active to arrive at an understanding with the Elliott Group about the price at which the Group would like to exit its stake in the firm so that AZPAB can realise its ultimate goal of delisting the company from the stock exchanges.

Besides, Elliott Group had voted in favour of the delisting resolution proposed by the company, and without its support, the delisting proposal would have certainly fallen through, it added.

It further said these are sufficient ground to conclude that ""there existed a prior meeting of minds between AZPAB and the Elliott Group with regard to the proposed delisting of AZPIL"".

The regulator said it is disquieting to note the way the promoters of the company and the Elliott Group have conducted themselves while brazenly dealing with each other trying to arrive at an negotiated deal on the best price that may be acceptable to the Elliott Group.

In this process, they have not bothered to think about the interest of other minority shareholders who had held 8.9 percent of the total shareholding of the company nor have they thought about the adverse impact of their collusive behaviour on the interest of other investors in the securities market, SEBI said.

However, their plan to execute their ambition through an artifice or device in the form of pre-arranged negotiated price for delisting could not fructify due to judicial intervention and the interest of the minority public shareholders remained protected as well as saved from being adversely affected by the probable manipulative their actions, it added.

In the order passed on Friday, the regulator cautioned the promoter company as well as Elliott Group and directed them to refrain from indulging in such unfair trade practices in future.

It further said that in case a fresh delisting proposal is initiated by the promoter company anytime in future, the same will be initiated only after complying with regulatory provisions in letter and spirit.

Stock exchanges, BSE and NSE, have been directed to closely monitor the entire delisting process to be initiated by the company in future to ensure complete satisfaction of all regulatory stipulations with fairness, transparency and integrity, and to promptly report any aberrations noticed in the delisting process of AZPIL to SEBI, it added.

https://www.businesstoday.in/markets/commodities/gold-price-turns-volatile-silver-rates-at-rs-60900/story/416699.html,"Gold, Silver prices in India on September 22: Gold price gave up early gains and traded flat on Tuesday, as the resurgence of coronavirus cases in Europe and uncertainty on more fiscal stimulus to support the economy in the US crippled market sentiment.

Gold rose in early trade today after the dollar index fell 0.14 per cent to 93.52 against a basket of six currencies. Although investors took a cautious stance on the bullion later and focused on speeches by Federal Reserve policymakers on the US central bank's approach to inflation and stimulus measures.

Precious metals have also moved in tandem with global equity markets and turned red on a firm dollar and on cautious stance ahead of US Federal Reserve official's speech later this week. Broader markets sold off again on Tuesday as investors were also concerned about the fresh coronavirus-induced curbs, globally denting hopes of a swift economic recovery.

On the Multi Commodity Exchange, Gold October Futures fell Rs 41 at Rs 50,430, after hitting an intraday low of Rs 50,385 against the previous close of Rs 50,417 per 10 gm.

Silver September Futures, traded Rs 186 lower at Rs 61,130 per kg today after they touched an intraday low of Rs 60,956 per kg. Silver Futures hit a lifetime high of Rs 77,949 on August 7.

Concerns about tensions between the US and China, worries about the sluggish pace of economic recovery also kept investors pessimistic.

Overseas, gold and silver gained marginally, aided by a weak dollar. Spot gold rose 0.3% to $1,918.20. Comex gold was trading 0.65% higher at $1,913 per ounce, while US gold futures gained 0.6% to $1,921.50. Silver gained 1.1% to $25 per ounce.

In the international platform, gold slumped 3.4% in the previous session, while Silver spot slipped as well by more than 1%, amid concerns over fresh rounds of coronavirus-induced lockdowns across Europe.

Gold price falls to Rs 51,500, silver rates at Rs 67,500

Gold has gained nearly 26% so far this year in the international market as near-zero interest rates globally dented hopes of fast economic recovery from the pandemic. Since the beginning of the year, the yellow metal has risen 41.5% to life-time high of Rs 56,191 per 10 gm, hit on August.

US dollar gave up some of its gains and fell today as focus turned towards Central bank Chairman's testimony. US FOMC Chair will testify today before the House of Representatives. Commodity traders said investors awaited developments on the US fiscal stimulus by the Federal Reserve policymakers in the US.

Uncertainty about a fresh round of fiscal stimulus from Washington and concerns over tensions between world two largest economies and worries about the sluggish pace of economic recovery have kept trades muted recently.

Similarly, on the equities front, global markets tumbled after Wall Street declined for the third week, and most of the European indices slipped more than 2.00%. Domestic indices too fell for the fourth straight day, amid fears about the potential worsening of the coronavirus pandemic. The 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex was trading 290.04 points lower at 37,744.10 and broader NSE Nifty slipped 95.10 points to 11,155.45.

Investors were spooked amid a resurgence in COVID-19 infections across the world and European cities announcing new restrictions to curb the pandemic from spreading. Worldwide, there were 314 lakh confirmed cases and 9.69 lakh deaths from COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, India's death toll from COVID-19 infections rose to 0.88 lakh and total coronavirus cases stood at 55.62 lakh as of Tuesday.

On the retail front, physical gold dealers continued to offer discounts in India as the precious metal's demand fell due to high prices. In India, 24-carat bullion per 10 gram in the national capital fell marginally to Rs 54,770. Price of 24-carat gold stood at Rs 53,830 per 10 gram in Chennai. In Mumbai and Kolkata, the rate for 24-Carat gold stood at Rs 51,310 and 53,440, respectively.

Technical outlook

Expressing views on gold's trend, Anuj Gupta- DVP- Commodities and Currencies Research, Angel Broking said,"" Despite falling retail sales, the slowdown in consumer spending and a weak labour market in the US, the Federal Reserve expressed hopes of a paced recovery in the coming months which weighed on the safe haven, Gold. While the US Federal Reserve vowed to keep the interest rates low, no signs of further stimulus infusion to support the economy shackled by the pandemic further limited the gains for Gold.

Cameron Alexander, Director of Precious Metals Research at GFMS, Refinitiv said,""The rally in gold has been powered by a safe-haven appeal for the metal due to the worsening economic conditions resulting from an out-of-control pandemic. The central banks around the world continue to inject stimulus to resuscitate domestic economies, which has led in some cases to currency devaluation especially dollar and lower interest rates, further supporting the rally. Another factor that could disrupt the financial markets and support the gold rally is the political developments in the US.""

""Looking ahead, the focus will continue to be on the coronavirus developments worldwide and on fresh economic data coming out of the United States which will influence the price of gold in the short to medium term. Investors will be monitoring just how quickly the world's largest economy can return to expansion mode and how soon an economic relief bill will be finalised,"" he added.

Chidambaram said during the Budget 2020 announcement, the Finance Minister claimed the economic growth slide would be arrested and that economic growth would kick-start from now. ""I can't see how that'll happen,"" he added.

On the issue of infusion of Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure, Chidambaram said: ""This Rs 100 lakh crore is all puffery. We have to look at real numbers. In the current year, they planned to spend (total expenditure) Rs 27,86,000 crore. They ended up spending Rs 26,98,000 crore, roughly Rs 1 lakh crore less.""

He said the Centre must tell it'll raise the revenue to spend. ""Even though evidence shows it's not even able to spend the money allocated, either because of lack of funds or the government does not know how to spend,"" he said.

On the issue of disinvestment and partial stake sale of state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), Chidambaram hinted the Centre's divestment target was highly exaggerated.

""There are two issues, in the current year they planned to raise Rs 1,05,000 crore. On Budget Day, they raised Rs 18,000 crore. The revised estimate says Rs 65,000 crore. Let's assume they will raise Rs 47,000 crore in the remaining two months. Next year, they have pitched they're at Rs 2,10,000 crore,"" he said, adding these numbers were unrealistic.

Chidambaram said the Centre needed to tell people why it wanted to sell the LIC? ""LIC is no longer a monopoly. LIC is competing with the largest insurance companies in the world. LIC is profitable, well-managed and has increased its market share last year,"" he said, adding that it must explain why the government puts LIC and Air India in the same boat.

On the issue of $5 trillion economy and the Centre's claim of doubling agriculture income by 2022, Chidambaram said Chief Economic Advisor KV Subramanian, in the Economic Survey 2020, shifted the $5 trillion economy goal to 2030 from 2024. ""So why has he shifted the goalpost? And why hasn't the government acknowledged that?""

He said the Centre needed to first tell if the $5 trillion economy goal was nominal or real GDP? ""What have you assumed dollar value of rupee? That assumption is very important before you come to the conclusion of $5 trillion economy,"" he said.

https://www.livemint.com/Politics/t87eOLBL2RPw7JiUlhrwaL/RBI-rate-hikes-may-hurt-farmers-study-says.html,"New Delhi: Later this week, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee will meet to provide its assessment of inflation in India and, accordingly, set the repo rate.

At the meeting, they will consider various factors that threaten inflation. It was based on one of these factors—the increase in minimum support price (MSP) for crops—that the RBI had raised the repo rate earlier this year in August. However, a new study suggests that the RBI’s fears may have been overstated and the move could hurt farmers.

In a paper published in the latest Economic and Political Weekly, S. Mohanakumar and Premkumar examine the relationship between the MSP (a guaranteed price provided by the government for farmer’s produce) and inflation. Analyzing data from 2005-06 to 2017-18, they find that there is no statistically significant relationship between MSP for major crops (wheat, rice and cotton) and inflation. They argue that the lack of relationship is partly because many farmers do not even sell their produce at MSP.

They point to a NITI Aayog study which revealed that only 10% of India’s farmers are even aware of MSP before they sow their crops.

Consequently, authors believe the RBI’s response to hike the repo rate was inappropriate and could backfire. Since farmers rely heavily on credit for their production, a rate hike which increases the cost of credit will increase the supply price of agricultural commodities, according to the authors.

The increased cost of borrowing may also offset gains for farmers from the increase in MSP.

More broadly, the authors argue that the RBI’s rate hike could aggravate India’s agriculture crisis and even hurt small non-agricultural businesses.

https://www.financialexpress.com/money/commercial-real-estate-may-do-well-in-post-covid-19-world/1970958/,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a global health crisis, and its economic impact is also bigger. The abrupt halt of urban activities has led to a demand, supply and market shock. Reports suggest that the Indian GDP took an immense hit as its three major contributors – private consumption, investments, and external trade — were affected. These effects have percolated to all sectors, and real estate is no exception – constructions were stopped for a month at the project sites and so were the sales.

Speculations suggest a rise in the number of fence-sitters and delay in decisions on large investments like real estate, which may further escalate the agony. While retail and offices might take a little more time to be ‘Business as usual’, realtors are gearing up for the ‘new normal’ once the lockdown is over. According to a Savills report, the post-COVID-19 scenario will give a fresh start to the realty sector with a renewed vigour. The commercial realty is expected to bounce back once the lockdown is lifted.

Over the past few years, the commercial real estate sector has been, by and large, resilient to slowdown. It has also been the preferred investment choice as it is insulated from market volatility in the long run. A commercial property gives the average rental yield of 6%-10%, as opposed to the rental yield of 1.5% – 3.5% from a residential property. The same holds for capital appreciation in the current market scenario. Moreover, in the year 2019, the Indian retail witnessed a total PE inflow of $970 million with the commercial real estate attracting the maximum private equity investments to the tune of $3 billion in the first three quarters alone. A Colliers International report foresees continuity in private equity investment in Indian real estate over the long term, with a robust growth as compared to other major economies despite the COVID-19 outbreak. These statistics indicate the immense potential of commercial realty. Moreover, it is to be noted that the COVID-19 pandemic is only a temporary phase. Hence, it is likely that once the situation returns to normalcy, the prices will move towards an upward trajectory owing to a huge pent-up demand in the sector.

Fortunately, the government has announced a series of initiatives to propel the Indian economy. Additionally, the extension of deadline for completion of real estate projects and the Reserve Bank of India’s decision to allow a moratorium on all loans and deferment in interest payment on these loans for three months will be a huge breather for the real estate sector. Moreover, another cut in the reverse repo rate by 40 bps from 3.75 per cent to 3.35 per cent will further inject liquidity into the economy.

Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic will also redefine certain trends in the realty sector. Going forward, we expect that hygiene and wellness will be a key factor in assessing properties in both commercial and residential segments. In the commercial sector, it will compel developers to revisit their operational activities and services and carry out a comprehensive assessment of their hygiene and wellness measures. Also, the role of emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and 3D walkthroughs will become increasingly dominant and will continue to disrupt the real estate segment.

Bolstered by enabling policy reforms and demand pick-up, once the situation returns to normalcy, it will ensure that the commercial realty remains buoyant and continues to attract private equity investments.

So India’s challenges will compound from such a decision.”Telecom companies were expected to invest $4 billion in setting up 5G infrastructure, according to IDC estimates.That could be tough as companies including Bharti, Vodafone Group Plc and even state-run firms continue to struggle to make existing 4G networks profitable.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

According to the data from the Reserve Bank of India, bank credit as of February-end stood at Rs 89.8 lakh crore out of which Rs 10.95 lakh crore was deployed in micro and small enterprises – 6.7 per cent up from same period last year.

“They are in need of more working capital to sustain and bear their fixed costs etc. to keep going. They need that liquidity. Some of them may be earning revenues, some of them not depending on the sector. For instance in FMCG, they may be but perhaps not in sectors like automobiles while the effect varies. It is for the banker to assess their viability of stay alive and whether liquidity issue doesn’t morph into insolvency issue,” Renu Kohli, a Delhi-based independent economist told Financial Express Online. According to the RBI, as per Nayak Committee Report, working capital limits to small scale industry (SSI) units is computed on the basis of minimum 20 per cent of their estimated turnover up to credit limit of Rs 5 crore.

Small businesses, for example, in retail are staring at job cuts amid crumbled operations due to Coronavirus. As per a survey by the retail trade body Retailers Asociation of India, small retailers are likely to lay off 30 per cent of their employee strength ahead while medium retailers are expected to cut 12 per cent of their manpower, according to 768 retailers (including 682 small and medium retailers) responding in the survey. “Support for salary, a larger amount for sustaining business, relief in interest rates, and a better moratorium for repayments is what we seek from the government,” Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India had told Financial Express Online as among they asks from the government to help small and medium retailers financially.

The report from SBI also noted that the loss in labour and capital income of around Rs 3.60 lakh crore is maximum in hotels, trade, education, petroleum and agriculture. This is due to the “unorganized and proprietary form of business organization and nature of self-employment in our economy that accounts for around 30 per cent of GDP,” it added seeking a fiscal package for them. “There is a case for a fiscal package for them. Many of them may be just self-employed or at best having two-three people who are very often family members etc. All monetary, regulatory or fiscal measures taken by the government and RBI have been limited to one quarter.

The government ecommerce marketplace GeM also now exhibits a 'Make in India' filter, to help buyers know the ‘country of origin' of various goods on the platform.“While we stand with the government, at present, we are all against a knee jerk, emotion-led reaction on the issue [of boycotting Chinese goods]. If that happens, there will be a cost to be borne by the Indian economy for which it might not be ready as yet"", said Ajay Sahai , Director-General, FIEO.According to official estimates, China remains India’s top trading partner. It accounted for over 5% of India’s total exports in the financial year 2019-20 and more than 14% of imports. Currently, the two neighbouring nation’s balance of trade (BoT) is heavily tilted in favour of China.“There is a need to work out on a well thought out strategy. One thing that we can do is to keep a check on the exports of our raw material to China, using which China is competing with us in many markets,” Saraf suggested, adding there could be a cess on Indian exports of raw material such as cotton, spices, plastics and chemicals to China.China is the third-largest export market for Indian goods as of FY19-20. Sahai added that 50-60 percent of Indian exports go to China in the form of raw material.In many Indian sectors such as electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, manufacturers are hugely dependent on key imports from the neighbouring nation, which is also the world's second-largest economy. For example, a significant share of inputs required in electronics components manufacturing has traditionally been sourced from China. For many electronics manufacturers, it has always been financially viable to import the SKD (Semi Knocked Down) or CKD (Completely Knocked Down) equipment from China.With China in the backdrop, the apex body of exporters, while playing an active role in the government’s self-reliant India mission'( Aatma Nibhar Bharat Scheme), has asked its members to explore countries having high anti-China sentiments.

India's biggest and first such issue by the firm in nearly three decades offers one share for every 15 held at Rs 1,257, a 14.8 per cent discount from the current market price (CMP). The last time RIL tapped the public for funds was in 1991 via convertible debentures. But, considering the ongoing volatility in the stock markets, should investors subscribe to the rights issue?

The issue offers a good opportunity to the investors planning to increase equity exposure in the company, Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities, told BusinessToday.In. There are very few companies that show the strength to withstand disruptions and have value unlocking triggers in the current scenario, Jasani added.

""However, if one is afraid of equities now, then he can ignore the issue and also look to sell his original holdings in Reliance,"" Jasani noted. Adding, he said that the facility of making part payments is beneficial for shareholders in terms of parting liquidity. Of the Rs 1,257 per share price, only 25 per cent is to be paid at the time of subscription. A similar amount will be due for payment in May 2021 and the balance 50 per cent has to be paid in November 2021.

The rights issue is also being seen by analysts as an attempt by the company to cut its debt. At the end of March quarter, RIL had an outstanding debt of Rs 3,36,294 crore. It also had cash in hand of Rs 1,75,259 crore, bringing the net debt position to Rs 1,61,035 crore. ""We believe RIL's rights issue offered is a part of the company strategy that would help in deleveraging its balance sheet and achieve its target of reducing its net debt to zero by 2021. Further, we have a positive view on the company's growth prospects going ahead. Notably, the rights issue offer price (Rs 1,257) is trading at a discount of 14% (compared to the last closing price of Rs 1,459 on May 16, 2020) so one can apply to the rights issue,"" Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking, told BusinessToday.In

Commenting on the issue, Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities, said, ""With 4 deals bringing around Rs. 67,000 Cr to the table, it is almost certain that Jio will be demerged and listed, unlocking value for a number of shareholders such that the sum of parts will be much greater than the whole. Reliance Retail is also expected to eventually demerge, therefore shareholders in a holding company structure are always bound to benefit. Although, the stock price may experience some quarters of pain but over the long term 2-3 years horizon shareholders will certainly benefit.""

Shares of RIL ended the intraday trade at Rs 1,442.55, down 16.85 points, or 1.15 per cent from previous close on NSE. On Sunday, Reliance Jio, the telecom arm of RIL, announced an investment worth Rs 6,598.38 crore by General Atlantic.

https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/repayment-moratorium-to-postpone-asset-quality-stress-recognition-by-1-2-quarters-icra/1917463/,"Rating agency Icra on Thursday said that the three-month moratorium on repayments provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would postpone recognition of asset quality stress by 1-2 quarters. The agency said lenders with higher share of asset classes such as microfinance, commercial vehicles and MSMEs will be more vulnerable, while those with exposure towards asset classes like gold loans and salaried housing will be impacted less.

“Even in a scenario where the banks and non-banks are able to absorb such an increase in credit provisions through their P&Ls and prevent the capital erosion, the level of stressed assets in relation to the core equity is expected to increase, thereby weakening their solvency profile,” said Karthik Srinivasan, group head, financial sector ratings, Icra. The rating agency expected the GDP growth to slow down to 2% during FY21, with the growth in Q1FY21 coming in at -4.5%.

Following the recent cut in policy rates by the RBI and small savings rates by the government, Icra said banks are expected to cut their one-year deposit rates by about 50-70 basis points (bps) during FY21. Some private banks and NBFCs will continue to face elevated funding costs amid higher risk aversion from the investors, it noted.

For the NBFCs, high reliance on debt market borrowings may pose challenges as a moratorium may not be available on these borrowings. The ability to have diversified funding sources, including access to debt capital markets, will remain as a key differentiator for non-banks, Icra said.

“Amid funding challenges, higher on-balance sheet liquidity and uncertainty on asset quality, private lenders are likely to remain cautious on fresh disbursements, whereas the public sector lenders may be constrained by their capital position and merger-induced bottlenecks.” Icra said, adding that with low credit growth, likely rise in credit costs and excess liquidity, the profitability of financial entities to be adversely affected by 50-90 bps during FY21.",Icra says the three-month moratorium on repayments by the RBI will postpone recognition of asset quality stress by 1-2 quarters. the rating agency expects the GDP growth to slow down to 2% during FY21. banks are expected to cut their one-year deposit rates by about 50-70 basis points (bps) during FY21. some private banks and NBFCs will continue to face elevated funding costs amid higher risk aversion from the investors.,Negative

The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), however, said a clear picture will emerge only after the end of this month when it will roll out a survey to understand how its dealer members are planning with regards to reduction of outlets and manpower.

When asked if there is a fear that there could be bigger job losses in dealerships due to the COVID-19 impact than 2019 when the automotive industry was hit by a prolonged slowdown, FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale told : ""Yes, if demand doesn't pick up. Obviously.""

Between May and July last year, the automobiles dealerships across the country shed around 2 lakh jobs to tide over the impact of an unprecedented sales slump.

Kale, however, said, ""To really understand the indication of what kind of job losses we are staring at (due to COVID-19), it will only be (possible) after this month. April and May have been completely under lockdown. You can't really gauge what is the demand situation (now).""

He further said a clear picture is expected to emerge only at the end of this month in terms of how the pandemic has affected the economy, which market segment has been hit more -- urban or rural or a combination of both and whether it is the upper class or the middle class who have been hit harder.

""We will get clarity only in June on what kind of demand situation is there for different kinds of vehicle categories. Only towards the end of June we will be rolling out a new survey to understand what kind of changes dealers are working with regarding reduction of outlets and manpower reduction,"" Kale said. He, however, asserted cutting jobs is the last option that automobile dealers resort to.

""It is not easy for us to let go of our manpower as that is the most valuable resource. We train them over many years and they gradually rise through in our organisations. That is the last call we take. Inventory would be the first call we take and other variables expenses, manpower would be the last,"" Kale asserted.

Therefore, he said, ""It will be at least after a month of routine business that we see, based on which we will take a call. If demand doesn't pick up, there will be a reduction of manpower.""

When asked if there has been closure of any dealerships due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, he replied in the negative.

""There has been no closure of dealerships as yet. In the dealership business, as we are traders, the decisions are not so sudden. For us, one good thing is that the service business is slowly coming back. A dealer will not take a call so soon on whether he wants to exit his business or if he wants to survive based on the current demand and financials,"" Kale said.

He further said, ""We will get those indications in July. Manpower reduction, we will know by June-end because each and every dealer will assess the demand situation, how does he forsees what are the problems and he is facing and take a call.""

As per an estimate, around Rs 1.08 lakh crore worth of borrowings of NBFCs will mature in the next three months, which will put a lot of strain on them. ""There are near-term scheduled redemptions of commercial papers and corporate bonds issued by NBFCs. To a certain extent, these could be bridged through increased bank borrowing or group support by some NBFCs. However, given the current financing conditions and developments in the mutual fund sector, the possibility of liquidity pressures remaining elevated for some of these NBFCs, especially those with high dependencies on market borrowing, cannot be ruled out,"" an RBI study has stated.

Regulatory or liquidity measures taken by the Reserve Bank have had a salutary impact on financial markets, it said, adding that stress was still visible in certain areas. The emerging developments indicate the need for policy interventions, which go beyond liquidity related measures to credit-related ones, it maintained. The RBI study also showed that there was a need for ensuring the flow of credit to NBFCs with ""concrete credit backstop"" to address the risk aversion in the system.

It believed the recent government measures for NBFCs, such as the special liquidity scheme and the partial credit guarantee scheme were expected to improve the market financing conditions for the sector. The NBFC sector is already struggling with liquidity issues since 2018. The IL&FS related developments in 2018 brought the sector under greater market discipline and the market borrowing costs increased for entities, especially those with perceived asset-liability mismatch issues or asset quality concerns.

Now the recent COVID-19 related disruptions and the developments in the mutual fund sector, which have emerged as one of the major lenders to the NBFC sector, have further impacted the market their financing conditions, it said.

The study also assessed the households' liabilities and found that they peaked in the March quarter of FY20, indicating a rise in the hardships owing to the coronavirus crisis. ""Households' gross financial liabilities turned negative in Q12019-20 owing mainly to a contraction in borrowings from commercial banks, but picked up thereafter and peaked in Q42019-20, reflecting apart from the seasonal uptick, higher borrowings induced by COVID-19 related hardships"" showed the RBI study.

CBI advocate Hiten Venegavkar told a division bench of Justices S S Jadhav and N J Jamadar that since the allegations pertain to the year 2012-2013, the agency has to recover relevant documents which will take some time.

The court was hearing a petition filed by the Jignesh Shah-promoted company, earlier known as Financial Technologies Ltd, questioning the ‘delayed’ action by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against senior Congress leader Chidambaram and bureaucrats K P Krishnan and Ramesh Abhishek. Abhishek was chairman of the Forward Markets Commission and Krishnan was an additional secretary and joint secretary in the Ministry of Finance when Chidambaram was the finance minister.

“We (CBI) are conducting preliminary enquiry. Since the case dates back to the year 2012 and 2013, we need to apply our mind and verify the allegations levelled and recover all relevant documents,” Venegavkar said.

He said the complainant (63 moons technologies) was summoned by the CBI for recording of statement and the firm was asked to submit further evidence in support of its allegations.

“However, till date CBI has not received any further evidence or documents from the petitioner company,” Venegavkar said.

Advocate Aabad Ponda, appearing for 63 moons technologies, refuted this argument and said all relevant documents have already been submitted to the CBI.

“A preliminary enquiry, as per provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, has to be completed within a period of four months. In this case, the preliminary enquiry as initiated in February. We (petitioner) moved the high court in July,” Ponda argued.

The bench directed the CBI to file an affidavit stating details of their enquiry and posted the plea for further hearing on August 13.

On February 15, 2019, 63 moons technologies filed a complaint with the CBI, seeking that a case be registered against the three for allegedly abusing their official positions and causing damage to the company when the multi-crore payment default scam at the National Spot Exchange Limited (MSEL) came to light.

On June 20, 2019, the company filed a petition in the high court, seeking a direction to the CBI to register a FIR.

In August 2019, the CBI informed the court that after verification of the complaint, a preliminary enquiry (PE) will be initiated. The petition said in March 2020, the company representatives were summoned by the CBI to record their statement as the preliminary enquiry was initiated.

“Four months have lapsed since then and there has been no further communication from the CBI and the agency has not registered FIR too,” the petition filed on July 4 said.

The market has not seen any strong move on either side for last one-and-half-month after showing a recovery in April.

The rising cases of new infections, worries over economic and earnings growth due to lockdown, and increasing tensions between US and China continued to worry the market participants.

On the other hand, stable oil prices, fiscal & liquidity measures by RBI and the government, and hope of further opening up of economy saved the market from completely losing ground.

Experts feel the market will remain rangebound in coming months unless there is decline in new infections and US-China trade tensions will continue to weigh on global sentiment.

""Recently the stimulus package of Rs 20 lakh crore gave an emotional uplift to the stock market, however, we believe the Indian stock market will follow the global trend in the medium term,"" Amit Jain of Ashika Wealth Advisors told Moneycontrol.

This war between USA & China may intensify further & may take ugly shape going forward, which may change World Power Equation post-COVID-19 era, he feels.

Ajay Bodke, CEO & Chief Portfolio Manager (PMS) at Prabhudas Lilladher said in the wake of US and China trade war, markets would be torn between two contrasting sentiments - ""Opening up of the economy trade"" versus ""Global trade wars disrupting economic growth & heightened risk aversion trade"".

But experts advised investors to continue to pick quality stocks as lot of them are still available at cheap valuations given their strong pedigree and attractive valuations.

""The COVID-19 hit has generated great opportunities for everyone to invest in quality business models at attractive valuations. This opportunity is being presented to investors after 12 long years and should not be missed. Investors should focus on investing in right Economy, right Sector, right Business models & rightly compliant companies,"" Amit Jain said.

Here are top 15 stocks which got upgraded to buy by brokerage houses in the last one month, expect 11-75% returns in a year:

Orient Cement

""Orient Cement currently trades at a replacement cost of Rs 220 crore/mt sharply lower due to the reaction to the current weakness followed by the COVID-19 pandemic which we feel is overdone. We assign replacement cost of Rs 300 crore/mt March 2022E capacities to arrive at a fair value of Rs 71/sh (earlier Rs 72/sh),"" said Centrum Broking.

""The discount is still higher (replacement cost of Rs 750 crore/mt) due to risk of regional concentration. New capacity addition is on hold helping Orient Cement to shape its balance sheet better. At our target price the stocks trade at an EV/EBITDA of 5.2x FY22 earnings. We have revised our add rating and upgrade the stock to buy,"" it added.

Quess Corp

""The stock corrected almost around 75 percent from pre-COVID-19 levels on concerns around: a) the severe impact on general staffing and collections, b) liquidity position, and c) the potential legal liabilities in outcome-based businesses, said Motilal Oswal.

""However, given a) industry concerns around manpower shortages / sharp wage increases and b) government orders forbidding lay-offs, we understand the General Staffing segment has not witnessed any material dislocation thus far,"" the brokerage added.

Accordingly, Motilal Oswal believes the above-mentioned concerns are exaggerated. ""A material impact is unlikely going forward as the economy goes into a phased reopening and enterprises try to dodge the supply-side disruption.""

Ministry of Finance recently announced that 44 central labour laws are being subsumed into four uniform codes. Reduced labour market rigidity should increase the formality of the workforce, in turn driving demand for flexi staffing. Motilal Oswal expects Quess / TeamLease / SIS Security to be the biggest long-term beneficiaries of these reforms.

In the base case, the brokerage expects 13/15 percent revenue/EPS CAGR over FY20–22E. ""Using residual income approach, we arrive at a target price of Rs 280. Encouraging efforts by the new management to address certain investor concerns (e.g., capital allocation and governance) would be a key re-rating driver.""

Vedanta

""Vedanta has corrected over 50 percent from its 52-week high, in line with the correction in other metal stocks due to the impact of COVID-19. However, with the recovery in China in nascent stages, we believe commodities are passing through trough pricing,"" Emkay Global said.

The brokerage feels the pandemic will lead to a reduction in both demand and prices for most of the commodities in FY21; however, it expects a revival in FY22 and normalization of demand in FY23, driven by fiscal stimulus implemented by most of the large economies globally.

The announcement of delisting comes at cyclical lows, said Emkay which believes at a significant discount to the fair value, especially when oil, zinc, aluminum, lead all have taken a beating due to the pandemic and greenshoots of recovery have started emerging in China.

The brokerage upgraded to buy from sell with a target of Rs 112 (Rs 134 earlier) based on SoTP.

Power Grid Corporation

JM Financial upgraded Power Grid to buy while maintaining target of Rs 200 and estimates given the sharp correction to prices without any changes in the stock’s core fundamentals.

""Despite a slower capex driven deceleration in profit growth (from 25 percent past to 9 percent in future), we find Power Grid earnings to be most resilient to demand slowdown. Additionally PGCIL does not have any overhangs of ESG or threat of renewables given all power (regardless of source of generation) has to be transmitted,"" said the brokerage.

Alembic Pharma

Yes Securities upgraded Alembic Pharma to a conviction buy with a revised price target of Rs 1,100, the highest on the street, as it raised multiple to 25x FY22. ""We reckon market would reward stocks with visibility of revenues and profits and such companies would trade at a wide premium to sector averages. This is evident in pharma where, despite recent rally, few stocks still command a premium to sector valuation as earnings visibility remains robust.""

""Alembic trades at a discount to peers like Torrent and Dr Reddy's Labs even as earnings comfort in the medium term remains high. Company is set to monetize Rs20bn worth of capex over next 3 years as filings commence from new facilities. This would drive a 20 percent CAGR surge in ex-Sartans US revenues to touch $450 million in FY24,"" said the brokerage.

""Moreover, domestic business has bottomed out in FY20 with our confidence based on robust performance in Q4 to end FY20 on a strong note. While we remain cognizant that gross margins would give up recent gain as Sartans opportunity recede, EBIDTA would pick up pace especially beyond FY22, as filings gain scale and approval,"" it added.

Birla Corporation

""Birla Corporation reported a healthy Q4FY20 performance. While the ongoing expansion may increase the debt burden in the medium term, the company’s healthy asset utilisations, healthy margin profile remain key positives, which will help the company to ride this medium term challenges,"" said ICICI Direct which upgraded the stock to buy with a revised target price of Rs 610 per share.

Mahanagar Gas

Motilal Oswal upgraded Mahanagar Gas to buy considering its cheap valuations (at Rs 1,100 valuing it in line with global peers at 16x FY22E EPS). ""The company trades at over 50 percent discount to IGL's P/E, P/B and EV/EBIDTA (despite enjoying the highest EBITDA/scm), offering the highest dividend yield among CGDs at around 2.5-2.8 percent. All of these attributes make Mahanagar Gas an attractive value-play in the CGD space.""

Despite being categorized as CGDs, the model of operation differs significantly among the three incumbents, i.e. the industrially inclined - GUJGA (with over 75 percent of PNG-Ind volumes) and CNG inclined – Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar (with over 75 percent of CNG volumes), said the brokerage, adding also, while Gujarat Gas has potential volume triggers from the NGT’s recent directive, IGL and Mahanagar Gas play a limited role in the same.

Mahindra CIE Automotive

ICICI Direct feels the Mahindra CIE Automotive's (MCI) current market price bakes in much of the negatives and present valuations look attractive from a medium to long term standpoint.

Accordingly, the brokerage house upgraded MCI to buy with a revised target price of Rs 100, valuing it at 5.5x CY21E EV/EBITDA (implied 10x P/E of CY21E EPS). ""The company’s track record of consistent CFO and FCF generation combined with strong MNC parentage and purchase of additional 0.03 percent stake by parent group CIE lend us additional comfort in our stance,"" it said.

Escorts

Escorts is a prominent tractor player domestically with market share in excess of 11 percent. The company’s brand of tractors is particularly strong in the northern as well as the eastern belt of India. With rural India relatively less impacted due to Covid-19, record food-grain procurement by government agencies as well as expectation of normal monsoon 2020, we expect the tractor industry to outperform the larger automobile space in FY21 with Escorts a key beneficiary, ICICI Direct feels.

On the balance sheet front, Escorts is a net cash company thereby holding surplus cash on books (around Rs 1,000 crore as of FY20) and also realises healthy return ratios matrix (RoCE at around 20 percent in FY20), thereby making a compelling case for an upgrade to buy, with a target of Rs 1,020 per share, said the brokerage house.

Astral Poly Technik

'Despite a substantial volume loss witnessed in March 2020 due to nationwide lockdown, Astral Poly Technik is possibly witnessing a phase of meteoric rise in its margin trajectory. The all-time high Q4FY20 EBIDTA margin, which the management clarified was without any one-offs, is largely attributed to strong gross margin expansion in both the product segments – which were led by the company’s backward integration drive, decentralisation efforts and increasing share of VAPs,"" ICICI Direct said.

""Besides the rising margin trajectory, the sustained focus on strengthening the balance sheet and likelihood of the company being one of the biggest beneficiaries of market share gains in the plumbing pipe segment, Astra’s recovery in earnings could be much earlier than anticipated,"" said the brokerage which upgraded the stock to buy (from add) with a revised target price of Rs 950 (earlier: Rs 1,096).

Gabriel India

Gabriel India (GIL) reported a relatively healthy set of Q4FY20 numbers. ICICI Direct expects sales, EBITDA, PAT to grow at a CAGR of -0.7 percent, 3.5 percent, -2.8 percent, respectively, over FY20P-22. The brokerage likes GIL for its domestic-oriented, debt-free, capital efficient business model (double digit return ratios) and a track record of strong CFO and FCF generation (present CFO yield around 10 percent).

GIL's 2-W slant is an added positive in present times, although reduction on OEM reliance would substantially bolster structural strength, it said. Post the recent sharp price correction, the brokerage believes GIL offers an attractive risk-reward play. Thus, it upgraded the stock to buy, valuing it at Rs 85.

Eicher Motors

Eicher Motors (EML) is the undisputed leader in the domestic premium motorcycle (>250 cc) segment through its established Royal Enfield (RE) franchise that has a strong product portfolio comprising popular models such as Classic, Bullet and Himalayan.

""The stock price of EML, however, saw a sharp fall in recent months tracking expectations of further pressures to be exerted on income levels & consequent purchasing power in the COVID-19 aftermath,"" said ICICI Direct which feels valuations have climbed down adequately, with the company now trading at 20x FY22E EPS against average two year forward P/E multiple of around 30x over last five years.

The brokerage feels EML presents an attractive risk-reward opportunity post steep price correction; with its undiminished brand loyalty seen acting as a catalyst for an eventual recovery once pandemic effects subside. ""We value EML on SOTP basis (24x P/E on FY22E RE EPS, 15x FY22E VECV EPS) to arrive at a target price of Rs 17,150 and upgrade the stock from hold to buy.""

Ambuja Cements

JM Financial valued Ambuja Cements on the basis of SOTP valuation (based on replacement cost), valuing the standalone business at a replacement cost of Rs 750 crore per million tonnes and arriving at a target price of Rs 215 (Rs200 earlier).

Ambuja Cements' clinker capacity addition will address its current clinker shortage issues, said the brokerage which expects savings from better operating leverage (around Rs 50 per tonne) following capacity utilisation improvement.

""The loss of incentives (from Q1CY20) will be offset by new capacity commissioning in around Q1CY21. Additionally, cost savings measures with captive coal block and new railway siding in Rajasthan will only boost/maintain earnings (even in challenging times). Healthy balance sheet (cash of Rs 9,000 crore CY21E) and debt free status only adds comfort,"" said JM Financial which upgraded the stock to buy from add rating earlier.

HCL Technologies

HCL Tech reported a healthy quarter (Q4FY20) from the perspective of margin expansion, said ICICI Direct which expects the company to see near term revenue and margin pressure led by COVID-19 pandemic.

""However, in the long-term, considering opportunities in cloud consumption, cyber security, automation, app modernisation, we remain optimistic on its revenue trajectory. Additionally, easing of seasonality pressure in the products & platforms business within IBM driven by renewals would ensure growth,"" said the brokerage.

""In addition, HCL Tech is also looking at captives, acquisition and vendor consolidation as revenue drivers, going forward. Further, we expect various cost rationalisation measures of the company to bear fruit in FY22E. This, coupled with reasonable valuation of 11x, prompt us to upgrade the stock to buy recommendation with a target price of Rs 585 per share,"" it added.

Maruti Suzuki

HDFC Securities upgraded Maruti Suzuki to a buy with a target of Rs 5,810 as it believes that the OEM is expected to gain market share in the current downturn, given its dominant position in the entry level/compact car segment, where the company has a market share of 65 percent (versus 51 percent overall).

""Maruti will benefit from its gasoline driven portfolio as the breakeven for diesel vehicles has further increased after the introduction of BSVI variants. As the company has a robust balance sheet, with cash reserves of around Rs 40,000 crore (around 25 percent of market cap), we expect the industry leader to withstand the downturn due to its scale and robust balance sheet,"" said the brokerage.

https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/it/why-it-firms-are-not-worried-about-us-suspension-of-h1-b-visas/story/407791.html,"US President Donald Trump in his latest executive order, a follow-up of the earlier April order intended to protect American jobs, has suspended the entry of several categories of visa holders including H1B and L which most IT firms apply for to send their workforce to the United States. Though the proclamation has a sunset clause at the end of the year (December 31), it also states that the effect of the order may be continued if found to be necessary. The order suspends and limits the entry of 'aliens' into the US, to those who are outside the country and also those seeking visas at the time of the order being passed.

The Indian IT industry body National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) in its statement said that the new proclamation which imposed new conditions for immigration was misguided and harmful to the US economy. ""American workers are facing greater challenges than they had in years, but that does not mean that talent shortages do not continue to exist,"" it stated.

Further, even at the current unemployment rates, an analysis of the Bureau of Labour Statistics' Current Population Survey by the National Foundation for American Progress found that the unemployment rate for computer professionals actually went down from 3 per cent in January 2020 to 2.8 per cent in April 2020.

New York-based immigration attorney, Anand G. Sinha , Founder & Principal Attorney at Anand Sinha Law, P.C says the biggest concern for IT companies is not whether they could hire or retain talent, but to find the right talent in the US. ""It takes time to grow homegrown talent,"" he says. While the Indian IT firms have been making steady investments in localisation efforts, over the past two years the increased H-1B rejections, local hiring, higher sub-contracting and lower onsite utilisation have also increased the onsite cost structure. For companies in the US, however, the worrying factor is not just talent but also the subsequent financial implications that they have to bear for non-availability of the same.

A report by HDFC Securities dated March 18 stated that the rise in H-1B wages in last two years was at 7.8 per cent CAGR due to higher H-1B rejections and shortage of talent trained on newer technologies. According to an analysis by the brokerage, every 1 per cent increase in US cost has -27bps impact on operating margins of IT firms . The report further noted that even though IT firms aim at higher localisation and on-site delivery centres, the H1B applications have shifted to lower cost destinations like Texas, Virginia, Florida, and Connecticut from high cost destinations like California, Washington, New York and New Jersey.

The regulator has conveyed its view to SBI, which is planning to recast the operations of the bank’s investment banking arm.The exercise could lead to hiving off the cash-spinning loan syndication division of SBI Capital Markets, offering a slice of equity in the entity to foreign investors, two senior bankers told ET.According to senior officials in the banking industry, the regulator’s attention was drawn to the debt syndication division by some of the small- and medium- sized banks which told the government that part of today’s ‘problem loans’ owes its origin to advances sanctioned on the basis of advice from SBI Capital Markets.SBI officials, however, strongly refute the allegation, saying that no bank can blame the SBI group as each lender should and does conduct respective due diligence before lending.When contacted, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said, “We are looking at revamping SBI Caps in a big way. Details are being worked out.”“We may sell part of equity stake and restructure the debt syndication cell of SBI Caps,” the SBI chairman added.He declined to share details as the board is yet to approve a resolution on the matter.SBI is likely to merge the debt syndication cell of SBI Caps with the relevant department in the parent bank. Besides a potential regulatory conflict, RBI has also pointed out a likely duplication of work between the main bank and the subsidiary. “Since there are cases where SBI Caps has advised on loan restructuring for corporates which are direct borrowers of SBI, a conflict of interest cannot be ruled out. So, for argument’s sake it is possible that the I-bank may be driven by the bank’s interest rather than by an independent view,” said a senior official of a stress asset firm.Many banks’ confidence in SBI Capital was understood to have been shaken when they took a knock following the bankruptcy of Kingfisher Airlines. The SBI arm was the advisor in restructuring of the troubled airline’s debts . “There have been instances when SBI Caps was engaged as adviser in syndication of loan and later hired to restructure debt when the borrower failed to repay,” said a banker.Over the past few months, RBI and the government have been scanning the overall eco-system in addressing the problem of non-performing assets ( NPAs or sticky loans). They have studied the functioning and role of rating agencies, registered valuers, large chartered accountants and management consultants including Big4 firms besides banks.According to another banker, many lenders were drawn by the SBI brand — often SBI agreed to lend when SBI Capital was the syndicator, and when SBI agreed to lend other banks too joined a consortium to bag a slice of action in a sluggish corporate loan market.SBI Capital’s exit from loan syndication move would be cheered by many loan arrangers and restructuring advisers vying for business in a competitive market where fee on a deal is 1-2%.","RBI points out 'conflict of interest' between state bank and subsidiary. regulator has conveyed view to recast operations of investment banking arm. exercise could lead to hiving off cash-spinning loan syndication division. officials strongly refute allegation, saying no bank can blame group. sBI is likely to merge debt syndication cell with relevant department in parent bank.",Negative

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Despite efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia to reduce supplies, crude inventories in the United States, the world's largest oil producer and consumer, have hit all-time highs.

""There is also a risk that gains in prices recently could see some U.S. shale producers restart wells,"" ANZ said.

Even as higher oil prices prompt some producers to resume drilling, the number of operating oil and natural gas rigs dropped to a record low last week.

Only 19,038 units were sold during April-June this year compared to 92,764 units in Q2 2019, according to PropTiger.

Affordable housing continued to dominate the real estate sector accounting for a 44 percent share of all sales, PropTiger said in its report Real Insight Residential Q2 2020.

Sales share of branded developers increased, as per the report.

New launches also decreased significantly during this period as developers remained cautious with commercial activity across sectors slowing down. Launches decreased 81 percent during the quarter ending June 30 to 12,564 units from 65,240 units last year. The first half of this calendar year showed a similar decline with a 65 percent dip in new launches.

Bengaluru witnessed the maximum supply of new launches in this quarter, the report stated.

New launches in Mumbai were down by 91 percent from 21,250 in Q2 2019 to 1,820 this year. New launches in Delhi-NCR decreased by 75 percent to 2,010 this year from 7,920 in 2019. New launches in Bengaluru were down 52 percent to 3,270 this year from 6,840 last year.

At least 61 percent new launches were in the less than Rs 75 lakh category, as per the report.

Inventory declines; overhang increases

When compared to the levels seen during the same quarter last year, the unsold stock also declined 13 percent in the eight cities, primarily on account of a fall in new launches. As on June 30, 2020, developers had an inventory of 738,335 units across these markets. At the end of Q2 2019, the unsold stock stood at 846,460 units.

At 56 percent, the Mumbai and Pune markets together contributed the highest share to this stock of unsold homes, followed by NCR (15 percent) and Bengaluru (10 percent).

Inventory overhang, however, increased to 35 months as against 28 months last year. Inventory overhang is the time developers take to sell off the unsold stock keeping in view the current sales velocity. At 53 months, the inventory overhang was the highest in the NCR market.

PropTiger also pointed out that nearly 20 percent of the unsold inventory is in the ready-to-move-in category.

Prices remain stagnant

Due to the strain from the demand side, price growth in India’s prime residential markets remained largely muted, with the majority of cities showing an annual growth between 1-3 percent in the past year.

Housing markets of Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, however, showed comparatively stronger growth, primarily on account of end-user demand in specific locations. When compared to the level seen in Q2 2019, weighted average price increased by 7 percent and 6 percent in Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, respectively.

Launches declined significantly across cities, especially in Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata and Chennai.

“The current pandemic is an unprecedented Black Swan event that is expected to contract growth in the global economy, including that of India. As anticipated, demand was adversely impacted due to economic uncertainty combined with growing unemployment; in fact, our recent Housing-NAREDCO buyer survey indicated buyers have pushed back their purchasing decision up to a year,” said Mani Rangarajan, Group COO, Housing.com, Makaan.com & PropTiger.com.

While, developers are increasingly offering schemes such as flexible payment plans, selective discounts and price protection plans to attract buyers, developers are understandably cautious and are focused on completing existing projects, he said.

Delivery of existing projects may also get pushed back depending on how quickly supply-chain, labour availability and liquidity inflows are restored. “We are unlikely to see new launches increase significantly for the next few quarters,” he said.

Brent crude rose 9 cents, or 0.2%, to $42.28 a barrel by 0009 GMT, while U.S. crude was at $39.76 a barrel, up 1 cent.

Both contracts rose about 9% last week and Brent crude futures flipped into backwardation, where oil for immediate delivery costs more than supply later, usually an indication of tightening supply.

In the United States and Canada, the number of operating oil and natural gas rigs fell to a record low even as higher oil prices prompt some producers to start drilling again.

Iraq and Kazakhstan pledged to comply better with oil production cuts during an OPEC+ panel on Thursday.

However, the OPEC+ group, consisting of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, has yet to decide whether to extend a record supply cut of 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) for a fourth month in August.

Oil prices have also been supported by a recovery in fuel demand globally following a collapse in April-May during coronavirus shutdowns as countries across the world resume economic activities.

Still, the World Health Organization reported a record jump in global coronavirus cases on Sunday, with the biggest increase seen in north and south America.

https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/corona-impact-estimates-put-fall-in-passenger-traffic-volumes-in-asia-pacific-at-24/1893876/,"Airports Council International (ACI) Asia-Pacific warns that the prolonged duration of the COVID-19 outbreak will significantly set back the region’s airports from previously forecasted growth prospects. The airport association urges regulators and governments to implement well-defined adjustments and relief measures tailored to suit local level contexts.

According to ACI World estimates, Asia-Pacific is facing the highest impact, with passenger traffic volumes down by 24% for the first quarter of 2020, compared to the forecasted traffic levels without COVID-19. Within the Asia-Pacific region, mainland China, Hong Kong SAR and the Republic of Korea remain at the centre of the effects with sizable losses in traffic volumes.

Meanwhile, there is a sharp spike in the number of coronavirus cases in several countries in West Asia, expecting to significantly impact traffic downwards by 4.2%, as travellers and airlines adjust their plans and seat offers in the coming days and weeks. Against the gloomy backdrop of sharp declines in traffic and passenger throughput, airports’ aeronautical revenues and non-aeronautical revenues are rendering similar declines. “The ACI World Airport Traffic Forecasts 2019–2040 predicts $12.4 billion revenue for the first quarter in the Asia-Pacific region in the ‘business as usual’ scenario. The impact of COVID-19 is projected to have a revenue loss of $3 billion,” a ACI report said.

The shortfall in the number of passengers and the cancellation of flights lead to reduced revenues from airport charges such as landing and parking fees paid by airlines, and passenger service and security levies paid by passengers. While aeronautical revenues are under pressure, the cost base for airport operations remains unchanged as airports can neither close nor relocate their terminals during the outbreak.

Non-aeronautical sources of revenue usually serve as diversification of airport income streams, but they also provide an additional cushion during economic downturns. To a large extent, the coronavirus is impacting Chinese passengers, the world’s largest and highest-spending outbound travel group, creating a wider worldwide effect on airports.

“Unlike airlines, who can choose to cancel flights or relocate their aircraft to other markets to reduce operating costs, airport operators manage immovable assets that cannot be closed down. They are faced with immediate cash flow pressures with limited ability to reduce fixed costs and few resources to fund capacity expansion efforts for longer-term future growth,” Stefano Baronci, director general of ACI Asia-Pacific, said. “For privately held airports, the situation is even worse as they do not benefit from relief measures but are obliged to continue paying concession fees to governments.”

“The severity of the current situation requires a close cooperation between airport operators and policy stakeholders to identify options to tackle the crisis. For continued regional prosperity, as all the long-term forecasts suggest, we have to consider the overall sustainability of the sector, starting with the shortage of airport capacity. Asia already manages more than 50% of the super-congested airports in the world and will require to build the large majority of greenfield airports globally. Further, it is in the interest of the airports to explore at local level with their main partners relief measures to face the current challenges and recovery plans to incentivise the return to a normalised market. The blanket application of proposals to reduce airport charges or to freeze the application of the 80/20 rule on airport slots globally should not be supported without passing an economic feasibility test and justification by objective evidence,” Baronci said.

Current slot allocation rules require airlines to use at least 80% of their allocated slots under normal operations at an airport in order to keep them.

The proposal for a global suspension of 80/20 usage recently made by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) would give airlines the freedom to cancel flights to/from congested airports not necessarily linked to the COVID-19 outbreak, jeopardising the ability for countries to stay connected with the world.","airport association urges regulators and governments to implement well-defined adjustments and relief measures tailored to local contexts. mainland china, Hong Kong SAR and the Republic of Korea remain at the centre of the effects with sizable losses in traffic volumes. there is a sharp spike in the number of coronavirus cases in several countries in west Asia, expecting to significantly impact traffic downwards by 4.2%.",Negative

In the current scenario, Tamilnadu and Uttarakhand are the hotspots of poaching,"" he said, adding that dense forests with open boundaries and low forest staffs are factors linked to increased poaching in a region.Based on earlier studies from 2011 to 2013, analysing 51 pangolin seizures reported all over India, the scientists said 42 of them were made from the North-eastern states of India.Assessing another report of more than 91 pangolin seizures, reported between 2009–2017, they said the states of Manipur and Tamilnadu have had the highest number of documented confiscations.The latest study by Kumar and his team indicated that between 2014 and 2018 most of the cases were reported from central, northern, and eastern Indian states where Maharashtra and Uttarakhand report the second highest position with 12 per cent of overall seizures.This study assessed the status of illegal trade of pangolin based on seizures reported from 2009 to 2018 in India using available data from print and electronic media.""Over the last decade 119 pangolin seizures were recorded and it is estimated that 7500 individuals perished in a decade. It is concluded that in India its north-eastern part is the hub of trade of pangolins,"" Kumar and his team noted in the study.According to the scientists, the poached animals are transported by traffickers into China and Myanmar through road and postal services.""Road transport, local taxi and postal service are the modes of trafficking. If we talking about Southern India, the traders purchase the pangolin body part from the local poachers, transport via road in trucks and other heavy vehicles by West Bengal to Assam, Nagaland, and transport into China via Myanmar,"" Kumar explained in an email.Asked about the reasons for the demand for the ""shy and nocturnal"" mammal, he said these are largely driven by myths about their healing properties.""People have myths that the pangolin's various body parts, especially their scales, and also its fetuses, blood, bones and claws have healing properties in traditional medicines,"" the wildlife conservationist said.Kumar clarified that there is no scientific proof for these beliefs, adding that some people also consume the animal as meat.""Their meat is considered a delicacy and high source of protein in restaurants, where its consumption is also a symbol of status,"" he added.As the ""secretive and slow-moving"" mammal continues to be killed and transported illegally, Kumar said the places from which they are removed may see changes in their ecology.""Ecologically pangolins are so important. In natural ecosystem it plays as a biological pest controller and soil caretakers. Due to their food preferences pangolin control the population of termites and ants in natural ecosystem,"" he said.Each year, Kumar said, a pangolin consumes about 70 million insects from the forest, making it safe for plant species.""Apart from that, their large and elongated claws make them capable of burrowing underground for shelter and to excavate termites and insects for food. In doing so the soil is mixed and aerated, improving the quality of the nutrients in the soil,"" he added.Since the major threat for the survival of pangolin is from local communities, Kumar said, an understanding of public perceptions and awareness on conservation of the mammal is important.",conservationists warn that the states of Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand are emerging as the hotspots for the poaching of pangolins. pangolins are a natural reservoir of coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2. the scaly anteater mammal is the most-commonly trafficked mammal in the world.,Negative

""But in this week itself, the midcap and smallcap indices have fallen 8 per cent each.

He thinks any short term bounce may fizzle out and the index may drift towards 10,550. Sunil Jain of Nirmal Bang Securities noted that the broader trend has been negative ever since the first selloff took place on August 31.

But the trend remains negative and the indices are unlikely to touch their recent high for now.""Umesh Shah of Samco Securities said that the market rise had been in disconnect with the economic reality. ""While the unlocking happened, businesses did not recover fully. But the froth in the midcaps and small caps space kept on building.

As your parents turn 60, they enter a phase of their lives when they need to spend a stress-free life with no worries. Ageing parents require frequent visits to the doctor and at times require repeated hospitalisation. While covering your parents under your family health insurance policy is a great way to ensure they get the best treatment whenever required, have you ever thought that considering the age of your parents, whether your family health insurance policy is really enough?

With healthcare inflation rising, your family health insurance cover of Rs 8-10 lakh may not necessarily solve the purpose. Moreover, there is a great possibility that if anybody makes a claim in a given year, the sum insured may fall short to pay for the entire hospital bill if another claim is made within the same policy year. This scenario makes it very important to cover your parents under an individual health insurance policy as chances of your elderly parents making a claim are much higher which may leave very less sum insured for the other insured members.

Also, if you choose to cover your elderly parents under your family floater health insurance policy, the premium would be significantly high. It is always better to cover your spouse and kids under one policy and your parents under a separate policy. This will not only help you to reduce the premium but will also help in enhancing the coverage as the sum insured will not be divided amongst many people.

Individual cover for parents

It is always suggested to cover your parents under a separate health insurance cover as early as possible because the earlier you buy a health cover for them, the greater will be the benefits. Most health insurance policies for senior citizens come with a set of limitations such as mandatory co-pay— wherein the insured has to pay a portion of the hospital bill—and extended waiting period. As senior citizens are more prone to particular ailments, the insurers implement a mandatory waiting period on many such common illnesses. If you get your parents enrolled under an individual health cover before they turn 60, there will be no burden of co-payment clause for a lifetime and also the waiting period will be served within a specified time period.

Checkbox for selecting a plan

While buying a health insurance cover for your parents, there are numerous things that you need to consider for a seamless experience. Most of the policies carry an entry age limitation and a policy seeker cannot buy a particular policy if the entry age is crossed. So before buying a policy, check the entry age. Also, go for a plan for your parents that offers maximum coverage against critical illnesses and pre-existing diseases. You may look for a health plan from insurers that have products specifically designed for elderly parents.

“Social agenda needs resources that can only be generated by reviving growth and expanding the pie. Versus most countries, we have been high on stringency of the lockdown and low on fiscal support,""Munot told Moneycontrol.

“The economic fallout is real and a matter of concern though,” he added.

He expressed concern that while the fiscal room may be limited, India must be cautious of the ""paradox of thrift"".

Paradox of thrift means individuals try to save more during an economic recession, which essentially leads to a fall in aggregate demand and hence in economic growth.

""Given the environment, both corporate sector and households may remain thrifty and risk-averse, the onus is on government to lever up and spend. While direct support to poor was critical during the lockdown, as the economy opens fiscal multiplier should be the driving force in prioritizing expenditure,"" he said.

Infrastructure projects should be prioritised to create immediate employment.

Fortunately, rural economy is in decent shape and must be shielded from supply chain disruptions as well as from the virus that returning migrant workers may bring along, Munot said.

RBI's role

Munot agreed that the central bank has been aggressive in policy response so far, but yet it has only met with partial success in achieving the desired outcomes.

He referred to the big disconnect between macro and micro level liquidity.

The tepid response to TLTRO 2.0 suggests lack of risk appetite and therefore the real economy stays starved for funds, Munot said.

Government providing first loss guarantee, further relaxation in prudential norms, and RBI capping absorption through the reverse repo window along with aggressive OMOs are some measures that should help transmission, Munot said.

Referring to the credit market, Munot said: ""This month credit markets witnessed an unprecedented event when a $ 3 billion bond portfolio was left wanting for liquidity in a $ 3 trillion economy.""

Next generation financial system reforms such as deepening of corporate bond markets, securitisation market, channelising patient capital through the AIF route and creating lenders of last resort, to name a few should be considered, he pointed out.

""Banks' lending behaviour is largely pro-cyclical and therefore we need a strong institutional framework to facilitate access to capital across the credit spectrum when the cycle is at its worst and its need to sustain the economy is the highest. If access to formal capital stays blocked, there is a risk of return to informal money lenders and in turn reverse the gains of formalisation. Amidst the recent challenges in the debt market, SBI MF's conservatism and prudent credit assessment has helped. Given the growth-inflation-external account dynamic, we stay long duration,"" Munot said.

On equities, he said: ""Several valuation measures were in the vicinity of GFC (Global Financial Crisis) lows in late March.""

However, he believes that the run-up since March has been too sharp given the challenging economic backdrop, and therefore further bouts of volatility should not be ruled out.

https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/how-us-ban-on-chinas-zte-wreaked-havoc-at-wireless-carriers-in-europe-and-south-asia/1247833/,"The U.S. trade ban on Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE wreaked havoc at wireless carriers in Europe and South Asia and forced operators worldwide to consider broadening their supply networks, industry sources told Reuters. Disruptions at Russian and emerging markets mobile operator Veon, one of the world’s 10 largest mobile firms by number of customers, illustrate the effects of the U.S. ban, which lasted three months, ending when the U.S. Commerce Department lifted the order on Friday. Veon was especially hard hit, suffering launch delays at its Italian joint venture and in Ukraine, near network outages in Bangladesh, and lesser disruptions at its Pakistan operations, sources at the Amsterdam-based operator told Reuters.

“Veon has decided to second source everything,” a person familiar with the strategy shift at Veon said of moves to reduce dependence on any one supplier of network gear. “We don’t want the company to be in the same position we were in when the U.S. (ban on ZTE) came out: It caused massive problems in three or four of our markets,” the source said. Perhaps the biggest setback was for Italian mobile operator Wind Tre, which had a 1 billion euro ($1.17 billion) contract with ZTE to upgrade radio equipment.

The ban forced ZTE to abandon more than half of the remainder of the contract, and Wind Tre will use gear from network supplier Ericsson instead, sources told Reuters. The original deal had marked ZTE’s biggest breakthrough into the European market, which has been dominated by regional players such as Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia of Finland. Ericsson’s win with Wind Tre could be a sign of renewed momentum for the Swedish equipment supplier, which has struggled in recent years with slowing growth, restructuring and big job cuts.

One industry expert said operators may start using multiple vendors to avoid being stuck with a supplier that comes under trade sanctions or suffers other extended disruptions. “Many supplier strategies will be reviewed,” said Bengt Nordstrom, a telecoms industry consultant based in Sweden who advises operators on equipment purchasing strategies.

“Wind Tre was the first example so far. This is a wake-up call to the industry that if you have a single vendor dominating your network supply chain – ZTE for now, but other vendors eventually – you are leaving yourself exposed.”

NETWORK FALLOUT

Veon’s Ukrainian unit, Kyivstar, the largest mobile operator in that country, postponed its introduction of 4G mobile services in April because of the ZTE ban, according to two sources at Veon and one at ZTE. “The 4G launch had to actually be put on hold, so Kyivstar lost ground to competitors because of our obligations to comply with the denial order,” said one of the sources, a senior executive at Veon.

Kyivstar’s two main rivals are Vodafone Ukraine, owned by Russia’s MTS/Sistema and UK-based global operator Vodafone ; and Lifecell, a unit of Turkcell of Turkey. Kyivstar launched its 4G service in early July, more than two months behind schedule, by using a part of the network that didn’t depend on ZTE, one source said. Network blackouts were narrowly averted at Veon’s Bangalink unit in Bangladesh.

“There was an issue with Bangladeshi network upgrades that really went down to the wire,” the source told Reuters. “Only at the 11th hour did the U.S. allow some temporary relief from the order.” Global telecoms trade group GSMA negotiated a one-month reprieve with the Commerce Department that allowed Bangalink and other ZTE customers to engage in “essential transactions” that allowed existing networks and handsets to keep working, the group said.

Veon has maintained strict compliance with the ZTE ban in all markets, two company sources said. All ZTE equipment shipped to Veon’s subsidiaries after the U.S. order was returned. This included both network hardware and ZTE mobile handsets, a Veon executive at its Russian operating subsidiary said.

Spanish telecom operator Telefonica relied on technical workarounds during the ban, but still cancelled some ZTE contracts, a separate source with knowledge of the relationship between the firms told Reuters. Lawyers at the two companies held weekly meetings to ensure careful compliance, the source said. ZTE was unable to ship any gear to the Spanish telecoms giant that relied on components from U.S.-based chipmakers Qualcomm or Intel or smartphones running the Google Android operating system, for example. Disruptions were minimized because ZTE contracts accounted for less than 5 percent of the telecom giant’s equipment spending, the source said.

The scale of workarounds and outages at other major ZTE customers, including China Mobile and MTN, Africa’s top operator, is not yet known. The U.S. Department of Commerce in April banned U.S. companies from selling goods to ZTE after the Chinese company failed to comply with a 2016 settlement involving evasion of sanctions against Iran. The U.S. lifted its ban on Friday, weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump said the punishment was too harsh.",industry sources say the ban on china's ZTE wreaked havoc at wireless carriers. the biggest setback was for italian mobile operator Wind Tre. the ban forced ZTE to abandon more than half of the remainder of the contract. the ban ended when the u.s.

https://www.financialexpress.com/money/insolvency-and-bankruptcy-laws-impact-of-covid-19-outbreak-and-opportunities-that-may-arise/1936344/,"Factoring in the outbreak of COVID-19, the fret of becoming NPA has been at the pinnacle for small and medium-sized business industry. From the struggles in paying salaries to the employees to seeking deferment of repayment of loans & GST, the same has been mirroring the effects of the pandemic over the industry. Consideration of the prevailing unprecedented scenario wherein the spread of pandemic has created a situation of hue and cry globally, the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary, in order to mitigate its adverse consequences, are consistently aiming to bring amendments in-laws, orders, notifications, and circulars.

Aiming protection to these business holders the MCA vide its notification dated 28.03.2020 has tried to relieve these entities by increasing the threshold limit for claim from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1 crore, i.e. now insolvency proceedings cannot be triggered against the corporate debtor unless there is a minimum default of Rs 1 crore. With this in mind, the companies can now focus on stabilizing the business operations rather than being under the constant fear of inevitable insolvency.

It is imperative to understand the indispensable role played by the Apex Court and the NCLAT. The Apex Court vide its order dated 23.03.2020 in the “Suo moto writ petition(civil) 03/2020” has taken the cognizance of the probable hurdles and extended the period of limitation for proceedings before all Courts/Tribunals in the country with effect from 15.03.2020 till further order(s) which is having a direct implication in the matters pertaining to the insolvency. Thereafter, the IBBI in a move relieving various stakeholders including the RP has amended the CIRP Regulations vide notification dated 29.03.2020 by inserting Regulation 40 C excluding the period of the lockdown for the purposes of calculating the timeline for any activity.

Furthermore, NCLAT in its order dated 30.03.2020 in “Suo Moto – Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No. 01 of 2020” taking reference of the dictum in “Quinn Logistics India Pvt. Ltd. vs. Mack Soft-Tech Pvt. Ltd” held that the period of lockdown shall be excluded for the purposes of CIRP and has ordered the continuance of the interim/stay order in any appeal under Companies Act, 2013 or Competition Act, 2002 passed by the Tribunal until the next hearing.

Similarly, the RBI in its notification dated 27.03.2020, mitigated the burden of debt by deferment of repayment of EMIs and Loan amount for a period of three months after the moratorium period from March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020, on their outstanding.

It is imperative to point out the predominant challenges in the domain of IBC which includes overburdened Tribunal adversely affecting the disposal of the cases, though the government in order to mitigate took an initiative to increase the benches by appointing more Judicial and Technical Members. Despite these efforts, the harsh reality is that the number of pending cases is at zenith, causing a delay in disposal, directly affecting the economy of the country.

Another challenge requiring utmost attention is the adjudication of the resolution plan approval applications filed before the Tribunal. In simple terms, once the resolution plan is approved by the CoC, an application is to be filed before the Tribunal seeking approval of the same resulting in the takeover of the stressed corporate debtor by the resolution applicant on the going concern basis. However, it is unfortunate that such applications that require expeditious disposal are kept pending for a very long time adversely affecting the resolution applicant. Another challenge which is faced by the RP is the non-cooperation from the suspended BOD, the CoC, difficulty in implementing the business decision and adherence/compliance of strict timelines and compliances amounting to the derailment, creating an opportunity for the competitors to be way ahead of the Corporate Debtor and deterioration in the value of assets.

The way forward

Undoubtedly, the orders passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, Hon’ble NCLAT along the notification passed by the IBBI unequivocally grant the much-needed relief to all the stakeholders by taking measures such as extending the period of limitation and excluding the period of lockdown and also, it shall minimize the hardships which would have otherwise been faced by the Resolution Professional in complying with the various statutory requirements.

If we look and analyze these measures, it can be evidently deduced that increment in the threshold would be directly proportional to the reduction in filings before NCLT (Tribunal) and it would unburden the Tribunal substantially and thus it shall be taken as an opportunity by the Tribunal to focus on the speedy disposal of the pending cases so that the Corporate Debtor can run their business again. To an extent it shall prevent the fall of the economy by increasing employment rate since now it is highly probable that the pending cases pertaining to the approval of the resolution plan shall be dealt with expeditiously. Thus, if the NCLT gears up and decides on all pending resolution plans, then there will be an opportunity for jobs for the people in the Indian market.

His testimony comes as President Donald Trump is praising states that are reopening after the prolonged lock-down aimed at controlling the virus' spread.

Fauci, a member of the coronavirus task force charged with shaping the response to COVID-19, which has killed tens of thousands of people in the U.S., is testifying via video conference after self-quarantining as a White House staffer tested positive for the virus.

With the U.S. economy in free-fall and more than 30 million people unemployed, Trump has been pressuring states to reopen.

Fauci, in a statement to The New York Times, warned that officials should adhere to federal guidelines for a phased reopening, including a “downward trajectory” of positive tests or documented cases of coronavirus over two weeks, robust contact tracing and “sentinel surveillance” testing of asymptomatic people in vulnerable populations, such as nursing homes.

“If we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines...then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country,"" Fauci wrote.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

City officials have temporarily shut a huge wholesale food market where the virus spread widely, re-closed schools and locked down some neighbourhoods.

A report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that testing has found only a few infected people without a link to the market and that the steps taken mean the risk of further spread is low, the official Xinhua News Agency said.

Anyone leaving Beijing is required to have a negative result from a nucleic acid test within the previous seven days. Many Chinese are travelling during a four-day holiday weekend that ends Sunday.

The list included Havells India, Ajanta Pharma, Orient Refectories, Hatsun Agro and recently listed Chalet Hotels.The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' recommendation using a single valuation ratio.Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.As for Nifty50, analysts maintain a positive stance, but believe weak market breadth could be a worry. Besides, some momentum oscillators suggest the stocks have become oversold.“The current chart pattern signals the possibility of a breakout of a recent upward range movement. But the overall market breadth was not impressive on Monday, with midcaps and smallcaps rising only marginally. The next upside range to watch out for is at 12,150-12,180,” said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking expects ‘gravity defying’ moves in coming days despite some of the momentum oscillators being in the overbought territories.“Mind you, we may not see immediate declines in the market amid such strong trends. Hence, it’s better not to be sceptical about the recent upward move and keep participating in this rally by following a stock-centric approach,” he said.A close look at the stock chart of Aurobindo Pharma shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock has shown an upward momentum and vice versa.On Tuesday, the scrip traded at Rs 653.80, down 0.46 per cent on NSE.","more midcap and smallcap stocks are signalling bearish trends than bullish signals. the momentum indicator signalled a bearish crossover on 46 counters. the list included many midcap and smallcap names, including Aurobindo Pharma. a nine-day exponential moving average is plotted on top of the MACD. when the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal.",Negative
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/covid-19-frbm-framework-will-need-to-be-updated-says-former-cea-arvind-subramanian-5357021.html,"Former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian on June 3 said the FRBM Act will probably have to be revised by the end of the year as India will witness a sharp decline in GDP growth due to the COVID-19 crisis.

Addressing a webinar organised by EY India, Subramanian further said while labour reforms were necessary, the way they have been done by some states have undermined basic protections to workers, especially in light of the migrant crisis.

""It is going to be a very very difficult economic year. We should brace ourselves for a sharp decline in GDP growth.

""We should also brace ourselves for the fact that India's deficit almost certainly will be double digit. India's fiscal situation is going to be very, very difficult,"" he said.

Subramanian, currently a visiting professor at Harvard University, further said reviving the financial sector is going to be critical for stimulating economic growth.

Talking about India's current macroeconomic situation amid the COVID-19 pandemic, he said the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act and terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission will probably have to be revised and updated.

""Compared to the Budget 2020-21, I think the facts have changed. We will probably have to revise, and update Budget numbers, the FRBM framework and the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission at the end of the year,"" Subramanian emphasised.

The FRBM Act of 2003 seeks to reduce the country's fiscal deficit through financial discipline.

He also pointed out that due to the Rs 20 lakh crore economic package announced by the government to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, India's debt-to-GDP will rise to 85 per cent.

The eminent economist also noted that the pandemic in India is not under control.

""Developing countries are much more vulnerable and have less fiscal space than advanced economies. Lockdown has been much more severe on developing countries,"" he said.

Noting that India entered into lockdown when its economy was already slowing, Subramanian said, ""It will take a lot of hard work for India to again start growing at 6 per cent.""

The former CEA also said the pandemic and the lockdown have made the case for Universal Basic Income (UBI) stronger.

Talking about labour reforms, Subramanian said it is true that India's labour laws required change.

""But these labour reforms have probably undermined basic protections which are absolutely critical,"" he said.

In recent weeks, various state governments, including Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, have either made amendments or proposed changes to existing labour laws as part of larger efforts to help businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Subramanian observed that it is not clear whether these kind of tweaks will be attractive enough for investors because they will say if things can be so drastically changed in one direction, then what is the guarantee that they will not be reversed equally suddenly?

""I think... action like this may not generate the kind of long term trust and credibility in policy that are required to take advantage,"" he opined.

He also said the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) needs some modifications as due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown many firms will go bankrupt.

""We also need bad bank in select sectors,"" he added.

Subramanian also pointed out that India must shed its protectionist attitude and become an exporting economy.

""Unless India's exports grow at 15 per cent, we won't get 8 per cent growth. For that, we should reverse some of the protectionist measures taken. ""If we turn protectionist, I don't know how can we be an exporting power. Self-sufficient exporting powerhouse is an oxymoron,"" he said.

The former CEA also termed the Centre's decision to allow states to borrow 200 basis points more than their fiscal deficit ceiling as an 'IMF-like programme'.

""In the height of a pandemic, putting such conditions may not be the right thing to do. Asking states to carry out power sector reforms is desirable but this may not be the right time,"" he argued.",former chief economic adviser says FRBM Act will probably have to be revised. he says the country will witness a sharp decline in GDP growth due to COVID-19. he also said the pandemic in india is not under control. he said reviving the financial sector is going to be critical for stimulating economic growth. he said the pandemic has made the case for universal basic income stronger.,Negative

https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronavirus-lockdown-indian-muslims-informal-economy-poor-middle-class-migrant-workers-labourers/story/401636.html,"The 40-day socio-economic lockdown is more likely to knock the bottom out of Indian economy largely dependent on informal establishments and informal workforce. If 93% of the total workforce is informal, as the Economic Survey of 2018-19 said, this would mean a proportionate population is dependent on their income which is hit hard due to lockdown, enfeebling demand even further.

No less than the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the champion of a market-driven economy, has come around to realise that ""the poor and the middle class"" are ""the main engines of growth"".

One of its studies looked at data from 156 to 159 economies across most advanced, emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs) for 1990-2012 and came to the conclusion that (a) rise in the income of the bottom 20% (the poor) drives GDP growth and (b) rise in the income of the top 20% (the rich) reduces GDP growth.

This would mean that India needs to take better care of its urban migrants, most of whom seem to have lost their jobs, shelter and food and the rural landless and small or marginal farmers who are finding it difficult to harvest or sell their produce due to the lockdown.

Mandis are dysfunctional and so are procurement and rural job guarantee scheme (MGNREGS), deepening the crisis for the bottom pile of India's economy.

While the plight of these segments of the informal economy has attracted public attention, however inadequate or ineffective, there is one more group that is equally vulnerable but remains completely below the radar, the Muslims.

The Muslims are the largest minority community with a 12.7% share of the population, relying far more on the informal economy than any other socio-religious or religious groups, including the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), as official data demonstrates and yet, their plight remains unnoticed and unaddressed.

Employment and livelihood deprivation of Muslims

The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) of 2017-18 released in 2019 shows that the Muslims have the lowest share in labour market among the major religious groups.

Measured in terms of labour force participation rate (LFPR) and workforce participation rate (WPR), Muslims have the lowest scores. (LFPR is ratio of people in the labour force (employed + unemployed) to the total population, WPR is ratio of employed to the total population.)

A comparison with the SCs and STs demonstrates that the Muslims are worse off than those too.

Two caveats are in order here: (i) such comparison can be made because the Muslims don't have SC and ST (very negligible) population; identified as they officially are as either belonging to 'general' category or other backward castes (OBCs) and (ii) such comparisons have been made by official committees in the past, the last one being the Post Sachar Evaluation Committee (PSEC) which submitted its report in September 2014.

What both the above graphs mean is that the Muslims are worse off in the labour market than any other socio-religious or religious group. That makes them more vulnerable than the rest.

This is not a new phenomenon.

The PLFS of 2017-18 provides comparative data from earlier NSSO surveys of 2004-05, 2009-10 too showing the same result.

In rural areas, the Muslims' WPR is lowest for all survey periods among the major religious groups.

The same is true in urban areas too.

The PSEC report of 2014, which mapped social, economic and educational progress of the Muslims since the Sachar Committee report of 2006, pointed at three main factors in its 2014 report: (a) relatively lower levels of education (b) absence of job reservations and (c) lowest level of women's participation in the labour force (FLFP) both in rural and urban areas vis-a-vis other major religious groups.

Muslims' reliance on low productive self-employment

The PSEC of 2014 collated socio-economic indicators for socio-religious groups from the NSSO surveys of 2004-05, 2009-19 and 2011-12 and showed that the Muslims had a higher share of informal jobs (self-employed), both in rural and urban areas and that a large number of urban households had shifted to lower productive (informal) employment.

Prof. Amitabh Kundu of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), who headed this committee, explains, in rural areas, the Muslim women's participation in the workforce is very low (lowest among all socio-religious and religious groups), most Muslims are landless and depend on crafts and trade. In urban areas, they depend on self-employment (carpenters, masons, etc.) and very few of them are in government jobs or employed in large industries or high-skilled organised sector jobs.

When it comes to consumption expenditure (another measure of economic status), his report says that in rural areas the Muslims have had a higher per capita expenditure than ST Hindus and SCs for the previous two decades because (i) they are outside agriculture and (ii) more dependent on small manufacturing and services activities that fetch higher than agricultural wages.

In urban areas, their consumption level is the lowest, lower than that of the SCs and STs.

Poverty rate among Muslims

Muslims also have a high percentage of the poor.

The PSEC of 2014 did a comparative study of socio-religious groups for rural and urban areas using data from the NSSO surveys of 2004-05 and 2011-12. The findings are plotted in the following graphs.

In rural areas, the Hindu STs were found to have the highest percentage of poor population, followed by Hindu SCs and Muslim OBCs.

In urban areas, the Muslim OBCs had the highest poverty rate in 2004-05 and second highest in 2011-12.

The PLFS of 2017-18 discontinued the practice of publishing a separate and detailed report for the religious groups and hence such a comparison can't be made now.

PC Mohanan, who was chairman of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) when this survey report was cleared for publication in 2019, says a conscious decision was taken to limit the publication of only employment-related data, not other socio-economic indicators. However, that data is available to researchers.

As a member of the PSEC of 2014 himself, Mohanan had recommended the need for more disaggregated data for socio-religious groups than what was available from the NSSO surveys of 2004-05, 2009-10 and 2011-12. That was because he felt more data was needed for properly addressing the problems associated with various religious minorities, including Muslims.

Now even less data is being made available in public (from the 2017-18 survey).

Threat of further marginalisation of Muslims

Recently, several instances of religious discrimination and further marginalisation of the Muslims have come to notice.

Media reports show many cases of vegetable vendors being asked to establish their religious identity, including by demanding their Aadhaar cards, and those found to be Muslims being forbidden to do business in Hindu areas. In others, Muslim women are being refused groceries because of their religion and street vendors carrying religious flags marking their religious segregation.

Such incidents are not restricted to private domains.

A government hospital of a state refused to admit a pregnant woman for being a Muslim, leading to delivery of the child in an ambulance and subsequent death of the child due to lack of medical attention. An inquiry is in progress. Another government hospital in a different state is accused of separating wards on religion lines for treating COVID-19 cases.

These instances may seem disparate and isolated ones confined to some states, but the grave danger they pose to India's growth and development prospects is huge, nevertheless.

Religious discrimination endangers economic prosperity too

Here is a multi-disciplinary global study spanning 109 countries over a period of 100 years that show religious discrimination is bad for the economic health of a country.

This study, 'Religious change preceded economic change in the 20th century', published in July 2018 by the researchers from Universities of Bristol (UK) and Tennessee (US), found that economic growth comes after secular polity, not the other way round.

The following graph, taken from this study, demonstrates the secularisation graph leading the development graph (GDP).

The inference is clear. Religious discrimination has the potential to de-rail far more than just social harmony and democratic order of a country.

https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/human-capital-education-skills-what-does-wealth-of-nations-entail-in-the-21st-century/1180257/,"The comprehensive definition of wealth for any nation entails social, human, institutional, produced and natural capital. Together, it measures the ‘wealth’ (inventory) for any nation.

Has India fairly and sufficiently performed to realise the true potential of wealth creation to promise sustained endurance?

Numerous studies (IMF; Bhalla S, The New Wealth of Nations; and World Bank) have discussed this macroeconomic concern, especially for developing and least developed nations since it forms the quintessential nucleus for the prospective growth and well-being of the economy at the macro level. In the same context, the concept of ‘social welfare’ is highly debated and largely remains misperceived. Still, GDP is considered to be the most popular proxy to depict and measure the magnitude of economic advancement by most nations. The paradox lies in the respective differing ideology behind wealth and GDP towards sustainability. It is often said that the challenge lies in not only to manage the asset volume portfolio, but also the constitution of the portfolio to require different types of capital like institutions, governance; in short, the social intangible capital (labour efficiency). Unfortunately, the RBI KLEMS database depicts somewhat reverse statistics on labour productivity average growth in India from 2011-12 to 2015-16 vis-a-vis preceding five years. Hence, while the nation as a whole is undergoing structural changeover, the true potential is far from its true realisation.

Has India adequately spent in the last few decades to govern its social intangible capital optimally?

Development of an economy not just includes the increase in the wealth, but also the compositional shifts in the comprehensive definition of wealth. As per the recent report by the World Economic Forum, the Global Human Capital Index (GHCI) score for India is nowhere close to the top performer (Norway) to ensure long-term perpetual success. India scores 55.29 (ranked 103rd place, slight improvement over previous year), much lesser than the Norwegian GHCI score at 77.12 (ranked first), despite of India’s out-performance among South Asian nations. As a consequence, the same has led to inequitable distribution leading to poorest country’s share of wealth to less than 1% of total global wealth. To develop, the measure of wealth (rather an intangible component of wealth) could not be discounted.

Is Indian network society set to pave the way for the prospective human wealth base?

India is considered to be the Asian powerhouse on most of the key macro fundamentals, still human capital developmental issues prove to be the paradox of plenty. While technology has essentially witnessed a subsequent proliferation in capital intensity, yet overall it has not squeezed aggregate employment in Indian service-based industries. At the same time, the shift from primary and secondary sectors towards tertiary may not be a constructive transition for India in the long run. The same may prove to be detrimental in labour productivity and per capita income levels. Rather, network society could contribute to economic growth through different mediums like production and investment mediums. Production medium shall definitely be benefiting the factor productivity growth (labour) through rapid technological change.

We are strong supporters and primary adopters of technology, but sometimes we ponder whether the inescapable assimilation of technology in our lives could moderate our classic human capacities, such as compassion and cooperation. Only through a skilled manpower base a country like India can ensure inclusion and innovation that could scale up the macroeconomic platform to relish the prospective digital technologies and dividends. Surprisingly, India’s (the government’s) digital adoption index (World Bank 2016 report) is the highest among South Asian nations from people, business and government arms. The same leaves a scope for people and business arms to attain the potential for the betterment of economic development by strengthening the job base.

Today’s think tanks are usually confined to conventional philosophy or are too engrossed by the multiplicity of demanding situations, so as to contemplate tactically on the disruptional innovative forces that will build the future. Information without accountability can prove to be disastrous. Ultimately, it all comes down to human resources and their values that will serve as the underlying foundation for the changing wealth of nations. The best way forward is to place personnel first and then empower them. As suggested by the World Economic Outlook and Economic Survey 2014-15, skill development and skill premium shall be of prime focus to reap demographic dividends. Policies should be enforced at sectoral, national and global level so as to deal with the competition simultaneously through appropriate regulatory mechanisms and public-private tie-ups to enjoy the benefits of factor productivity comparative advantage. The productivity gains should be made more inclusive to make it comparable (if not at par) with developed nations like the US and Germany.

The IT revolution is undeniably capable of robotising mankind by depriving its heart and soul in its most dehumanised expression. Nonetheless, as an adjunct to the finest traits of human nature—empathy, stewardship, creativity—it can also uplift mankind into a pristine unified and moral consciousness grounded on a mutual sense of destiny. It is our moral duty to ensure that the latter subsists.

US crude crashed to below $15 a barrel on Monday, its lowest level for over two decades, as concerns about a virus-triggered demand shock and lack of storage eclipsed an output cut deal. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the US benchmark, fell more than 19 per cent to $14.73 a barrel in early Asian trade before markets steadied and it clawed back some ground to $15.78 a barrel.

International benchmark Brent dropped 4.1 per cent to $26.93 a barrel, before rising and stabilising at $28.11.

Oil markets have plunged in recent weeks as lockdowns and travel restrictions to fight the coronavirus around the world batter demand for the commodity.

The crisis was compounded after Saudi Arabia, the kingpin of exporting group OPEC, launched a price war with non-OPEC member Russia.

Riyadh and Moscow drew a line under their dispute earlier this month when they and other countries agreed to cut output by almost 10 million barrels a day to boost virus-hit markets.

But prices have continued to fall heavily, with analysts saying the cuts will not be enough to make up for massive falls in demand caused by the pandemic.

WTI was hit particularly hard on Monday as analysts said there were concerns that its main storage facilities in the United States were filling up.

Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist with CMC Markets, said the plunge in WTI ""reflects a glut"" at the US facility in Cushing, Oklahoma.

The benchmark has now ""decoupled"" from Brent ""with the spread between the two reaching a decade high"", he said in a note.

ANZ added in a note that ""crude oil prices remained under pressure, as projections of weaker demand weigh on sentiment"".

""Despite the OPEC+ alliance agreeing to an unprecedented cut in output, the physical market is awash with oil,"" it said, referring to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC partners.

""Concern continues to mount that storage facilities in the US will run out of capacity.""

The US Energy Information Administration said crude inventories in the world's biggest economy rose by 19.25 million barrels last week, adding to the woes of the oversupplied world market.

Brent crude futures gained 69 cents, or 1.22 percent, to $58.02 per barrel by 1325 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures climbed 59 cents, 1.22 percent, to $49.11 per barrel. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday that there was a “very good chance” of reaching a settlement, while China’s Foreign Ministry said Beijing had the “good faith” to resolve trade friction with the United States.

Some analysts warned, however, that the relationship between the superpowers remained shaky and tensions could flare anew. “Surely, there will be more twists and turns in the saga and increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after March from 10 percent to 25 percent cannot be excluded,” Tamas Varga of PVM Oil Associates said. “For now, however, optimism prevails.” There is also concern that a worldwide economic slowdown will dent fuel consumption, leading the hedge fund industry to cut significantly its bullish positions in crude futures. S&P Global Ratings said it had lowered its average oil price forecasts for 2019 by $10 per barrel to $55 and $50 per barrel for Brent and WTI, respectively.

“Our lower oil price assumptions reflect slowing demand and rising supply globally,” said S&P Global Ratings analyst Danny Huang.

Saudi-based Arab Petroleum Investments Corp, a firm specialising in funding petroleum projects, estimated in a report on Tuesday that oil prices are likely to trade at $60 to $70 per barrel by mid-2019.

As a result, U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> rose by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) last year to a world record 11.7 million bpd.

""You can destroy a country this way by closing it down."" Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that the economic rescue package won't be used to support Trump companies.""We wrote a provision, not just the president but any major figure in government, cabinet, Senate, congressman, if they or their family have majority (of a company), they can't get grants or loans,"" he told CNN.Neither Trump nor his sons who directly oversee the company have detailed the financial damage they face.But it is clear: the nameplate hotels in New York , Washington, Chicago, Las Vegas, Vancouver and Hawaii are virtually empty.Likewise, his golf resorts are being ordered to lock up, even in remote Scotland. On Monday the Scottish Golf organization urged ""all golfers in Scotland refrain from golfing until further notice."" ""It's hurting me and it's hurting Hilton and it's hurting all of the great hotel chains all over the world,"" Trump said Saturday.Yet the Trump Organization refuses to completely shut his main hotels.""The hotel is open, the restaurants are closed, the spa is closed, the pool is closed,"" a receptionist at the Trump International Hotel & Tower on Central Park in New York told AFP, not giving her name.""There's a Whole Foods across the street. We can get something for you and bring it to your room,"" she suggested.John Boardman, head of the Washington branch of the Unite Here labor union, said the Trump International in Washington was still operating despite sweeping staff layoffs.""It doesn't make sense for them to stay open. The hotel has like three percent occupancy,"" said Boardman.""He may not be shutting it down just to be able to say they are still operating.""Since entering office, Trump has fended off pressure and lawsuits that alleged he was profiting from his properties while president.Business executives, diplomats and Middle Eastern kings seeking his favor stayed at his hotels, especially the Trump International just blocks from the White House.The Washington Post has reported on the huge amounts Saudis have paid to book up Trump hotel wings, and the high rates he charges his own Secret Service contingent when he travels to his own properties, including tens of thousands of dollars for golf carts.Several lawsuits have accused him of profiteering from his office -- against the US constitution's ""emoluments"" clause -- but none have stuck.But now much of that is moot, with the spread of COVID-19 forcing the country's hotel industry into crisis. Last week the industry, which provides jobs for some eight million people, asked the White House for $150 billion in support.Many were wondering whether part of the bailout -- a proposed $500 billion discretionary fund to support businesses that will be run by the US Treasury without public reporting -- would be deployed to aid Trump's hotels along with the rest of the industry.""Now more than ever, it is crucial that the American people know that the president is acting in the public's best interest and not for his own personal financial gain,"" Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, said.","president's hotel, golf course and real estate business is under threat of closure. he's ordered to close, and his golf courses in the u.s., Scotland and Ireland are under lockdown. a spokesman for the company says it is ""very concerned"" about the economic impact. a spokesman for the company says it is ""very concerned"" about the economic impact.",Negative

The downgrade in outlook comes as parts of China and Hong Kong remain under lockdown due to the deadly virus outbreak.

The ratings agency pointed out that China and Hong Kong (C&HK) region accounts for 14-15 per cent of global demand of cut and polished diamonds. Industry estimates show that the region accounts for 35 per cent of India's overall cut and polished diamond (CPD) exports.

China is a major market as it not only consumes imported diamonds locally, but also produces diamond studded jewellery and exports the same to the US, South East Asia and other markets in a big way, ICRA said. The export of polished diamonds to China is largely routed through Hong Kong, which is a major global diamond trading hub alongside Belgium and the United Arab Emirates, the ratings agency further added.

The cut and polished diamond industry has been feeling the heat due to ongoing trade and political tensions between China and the United States. Matters have taken a turn for the worse with economic shutdown due to coronavirus outbreak, which ""occurred during the busiest period for jewellery sales in China - the peak of the festive Lunar New Year extending from January 25 to February 08, 2020"", ICRA said.

""Apart from recent developments in China, the CPD industry had been going through weak demand conditions in key markets and pressure on gross margins due to declining finished prices. If the business lockdown continues in C&HK, industry pressure will aggravate thereby impacting cash flows. This can have a serious bearing, especially given the cautious lending to the sector and; potentially impact CPD players' credit profile,"" said Jay Seth, Vice President, Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited.

""The pandemic in China will also hit near-term global demand for CPD and the widespread economic shutdown in C&HK region which will further delay demand recovery,"" he further added.

CPD exports from India are down 17.6 per cent Y-o-Y during 9M FY2020 on account of the trade and political tensions and subdued macro-economic environment in markets other than the US. And now with potential adverse coronavirus impact, exports are likely to remain weak in current fiscal, ICRA said.

The cash flows of CPD companies will be also impacted due to delay in collections and inventory build-up. Most of them avail pre-shipment or post shipment credit (export bills discounting of tenor upto 120-150 days) from banks to fund their working capital requirements, the ratings agency said. The impact on companies' liquidity will become evident as more bills come overdue during the second half of February and March, if the amount is significant, it further added.

""Receivables delay from C&HK region beyond a reasonable time will mean companies will have to make good the payment out of their funds which in turn could pressurise their liquidity position,"" ICRA said.

On the positive side, Indian CPD companies could fulfil the demand for diamond studded jewellery in key markets as China and Hong Kong remain under lockdown. However, the industry would face elevated inventory levels if the shutdown continues till April, the report cautioned.

NEW YORK: Oil prices tumbled on Thursday on doubts that a deal between OPEC and allies to make a record oil supply cut would be enough to offset the collapse in global fuel demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, agreed to cut output by 10 million barrels per day from May, the group said in a statement.Before the coronavirus outbreak hit global transportation and economic activity, 10 million bpd was about 10 per cent of global supply.OPEC+ expects other producers including the United States to cut another 5 million bpd. But Washington has not offered to participate, and even if it did, the combined reduction in supply would be about half the 30 per cent worldwide fall in demandBrent futures fell $1.36, or 4.1 per cent, to settle at $31.48 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude dropped $2.33, or 9.3 per cent, to settle at $22.76.""The collapse in oil prices is a result of the reality that while OPEC is cutting as expected, there is simply too much crude in the physical space for sale, with too few pipelines to move it and too few buyers to take it,"" said Scott Shelton, energy specialist at United ICAP.OPEC+ had considered curbs as great as 15 million to 20 million barrels per day (bpd), or 15 per cent to 20 per cent of global supplies. The possibility of deeper cuts sent oil prices surging nearly 10 per cent early in the day.However, OPEC said it would ease output cuts between July and December to 8 million bpd and to 6 million barrels between January 2021 to April 2022.""A lot of hope got priced into this market over the past several days,"" said John Kilduff, partner at hedge fund Again Capital LLC.OPEC+ said it would hold another video conference meeting on June 10, to assess the market. Energy ministers from the Group of 20 (G20) major economies are set to meet on Friday.""We are expecting other producers outside the OPEC+ club to join the measures, which might happen tomorrow during G20,"" the head of Russia's wealth fund and one of Moscow's top oil negotiators, Kirill Dmitriev, told Reuters.A cut of 10 million bpd would be the biggest ever agreed by OPEC, but Russia has insisted it will only reduce output if the United States joins the deal.Canada and Brazil are cutting output now due to market forces, but Jason Kenney, premier of Alberta, Canada's largest producing province, said it has already done its part.The United States has not said it will mandate output reductions. Instead, it has noted that market forces are already causing producers to pull back, as it expects its output to fall by nearly 2 million bpd by next year.US oil rigs in operation dropped by 58 this week to 504, the lowest level since December 2016.The last OPEC meeting in early March ended acrimoniously, with Russia and Saudi Arabia unable to come to an agreement to curb output as the virus spread, adding to the slump in prices.Meanwhile, the US contract expiring in June rose to its highest premium over the front month",OPEC+ agreed to cut output by 10 million barrels per day from may. a record cut would offset the collapse in global fuel demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. a deal would ease curbs between July and December to 8 million bpd and 6 million barrels between January 2021 and April 2022. a u.s. crude futures contract fell 4.1 per cent to settle at $22.76 a barrel.,Negative

The concerns are multiple. The coming northern winter may trigger another wave of the virus as the wait for a vaccine continues. Government support for furloughed workers and bank moratoriums on loan repayments are set to expire. Strains between the US and China could get worse in the run-up to November’s presidential election, and undermine business confidence.

“We have seen peak rebound,"" Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at Pacific Investment Management Co., told Bloomberg Television. “From now on, the momentum is fading a little bit.""

View Full Image Graphic: Bloomberg

That sets up a delicate balancing act for governments. They’ve injected almost $20 trillion in fiscal and monetary support, in an effort to get the economy as far back to normal as is feasible in a pandemic, and can point to plenty of successes.

In the US, unemployment fell sharply in August and the housing market has been a bright spot. China’s steady recovery is cited by optimists as a guide to where the rest of the world is headed, while Germany is posting some decent industrial data too. And emerging markets are getting a breather from the dollar’s decline.

Long slog

But keeping up the momentum on all these fronts won’t be easy. It would likely require policy makers to top up their stimulus efforts, at a point when some are looking to cut back instead. And for all the scientific progress with vaccines, they won’t be available anytime soon on the scale needed to bring the virus under tight control -- a key condition for business-as-usual.

Meanwhile, there are headwinds. On labor markets, for example, government aid helped to drive an initial rebound -- which may have been the easy part. Next up is the long slog of retooling businesses, reallocating resources, and retraining workers in industries that are no longer viable. That kind of restructuring could play out for some time.

Already this month, some of the world’s best known industrial brands have signaled job cuts are on the way.

AP Moller-Maersk A/S is planning a major overhaul that’s set to affect thousands at the world’s biggest container shipping company. Ford Motor Co. is cutting about 5% of its US salaried workers, and United Airlines Holdings Inc. will eliminate 16,000 jobs next month as it shrinks operations.

There are other worrying signs too.

In China, which contained the virus months ago, consumers remain reluctant to spend and the nation’s biggest banks just posted their worst profit declines in more than a decade as bad debt ballooned.

US lawmakers continue to haggle over more fiscal stimulus, which may be needed to sustain the recovery in the world’s largest economy.

Adding 1.4 million jobs in August was “a big step in the right direction,"" said Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody’s Analytics. But the economy needs to maintain that kind of pace, he said, and “without fiscal stimulus that will be hard to do.""

‘Not looking good’

In Europe, gauges of activity are fading, and factories are trying to cut costs as weak demand and price cuts squeeze profit margins. While France and Germany have extended their furlough programs, the U.K. plans to end its version in October, potentially putting millions of jobs at risk.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who announced his resignation last month on health grounds, warned in a press conference that “winter is coming"" and the nation will need to gird to contain the virus.

What Bloomberg’s Economists Say

“High-frequency data paints a picture of a rapid rebound in the second quarter, and a stall - with activity still well short of pre-virus levels - in the third. There’s scope for further gains. If the U.S. did as well as Germany at containing the virus and getting back to work - for example - that would be a significant positive. To get back to pre-virus normality, a vaccine is required.""

--Tom Orlik, chief economist. Read more here

Stock markets are vulnerable to disappointment in economic numbers in the coming months amid a gradual curbing of emergency fiscal support.

“In terms of valuations, we’ve got to look beyond just what happened this week to the longer term,"" said Catherine Mann, global chief economist at Citigroup Inc. “And the longer term is not looking good right now in terms of support for consumption, and therefore business investment and growth in the U.S. economy.""

Overshadowing everything is the continued spread of the virus, with flare-ups around the world.

Even when a vaccine is devised, making it available worldwide on the necessary scale is going to take time, according to Warwick McKibbin of the Brookings Institution and Australia National University. His models suggest that the virus could cost the world economy some $35 trillion through 2025.

“You have to get quite a lot of the population vaccinated before the economic costs start to come down,"" he said.

Besides, escalation in US-China trade tension also increased gold demand. On MCX, gold June futures were up 0.28 per cent or Rs 132 at Rs 47,105 per 10 grams. While silver July futures advanced 1.39 per cent or Rs 670 to Rs 48,927 per kg. Despite today’s gain, gold prices are still Rs 1,000 off from a record high of Rs 47,929 per 10 grams. “Lingering geopolitical tensions like the US-China cold war and Iran-Venezuela oil trade amid US sanctions are likely to boost the yellow metal prices,” said Hareesh V- Head Commodity Research at Geojit Financial Services. “Meanwhile, reopening the global economy and gains in equities are likely to offset major rallies in the counter,” he added.

The total number of coronavirus cases in India witnessed a sharp spike of 6,535 new cases and 146 deaths. The total number of cases in the country now stands at 1,45,380 and the death toll has reached 4,167. “As long as prices stay above $1710, broad trend will remain on the positive side. However, a direct drop below $1665 is a signal of weakness,” Hareesh said.

Globally, gold ticked higher on Tuesday as brewing Sino-U.S. tensions over Hong Kong lifted demand for the safe-haven metal, though easing coronavirus-induced lockdown restrictions supported equities and capped bullion’s gain, according to Reuters. Spot gold rose 0.2% to $1,732.38 per ounce. US gold futures were down 0.1 per cent to $1,733.50.

When asked about Bolsonaro’s meddling in state-controlled Petrobras’ pricing policy this week, Guedes said he’d get more information when he returns home from Washington, where he’s been attending the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund.

Petrobras shares plunged more than 8 percent on Friday after Bolsonaro called the energy producer’s Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco and ordered him to cancel a planned increase in diesel prices.

“The president has many virtues, does a lot of right things, and he has already said he doesn’t understand much of economics,” Guedes told reporters on Saturday. “If he did something that’s not very reasonable, I’m sure we can fix it. A conversation fixes everything.”

Bolsonaro’s hastily-made decision sent shockwaves across Brazilian markets as it revived fears of the interventionist policies by previous Brazilian governments that analysts blame for fueling inflation and hurting the economy in recent years. A massive trucker strike hit the country a year ago when diesel prices were finally allowed to go up. Since then, the government temporarily subsidized diesel, and Petrobras has started adjusting its prices more sparingly.

Late on Friday, Bolsonaro’s spokesman said the president understands that Petrobras is a publicly-held company subject to market rules, and that it shouldn’t be subject to political interference.

Brent crude prices extended falls on Monday amid more action by governments to contain the global coronavirus outbreak that has slashed the demand outlook for oil and threatened a worldwide economic contraction.

Brent crude futures fell 65 cents, or 2.4%, to $26.33 a barrel by 0328 GMT. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 29 cents, or 1.3%, at $22.92 a barrel, having fallen 2 percentage points more than Brent this year.

Oil prices have fallen for four straight weeks and have dropped about 60% since the start of the year. Prices of everything from coal to copper have also been hit by the crisis, while markets in bonds and stocks enter rarely charted territory.

The Tokyo Olympics became the latest potential casualty of the pandemic as Japan and the games organizers' raised the prospect of a delay from the summer, while Canada announced it will not send athletes to the event.

The coronavirus, which has infected more than 325,000 and killed over 14,000 worldwide, has disrupted business, travel and daily life. Many oil companies have rushed to cut spending and some producers have already begun putting employees on furlough.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

The market has had to contend with the twin shocks of the demand destruction caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the unexpected oil price war that erupted between producers Russia and Saudi Arabia earlier this month.

The current production cut deal expires March 31. The gap between current levels and prices in six months widened to the highest in more than a decade as traders tried to find space to hold oil amid the contraction in prompt demand.

""Even if oil prices somehow manage to rebound a little more, oil is heading south as the demand destruction for crude will only get worst as more countries intensify their shutting down of non-essential business efforts and as storage space for crude runs out,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.

Almost a third of Americans are now under orders to stay at home as states took extra measures to stem the rising numbers of cases in the world's biggest economy, while in New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Adern said all non-essential services and business are to be shut down.

https://www.financialexpress.com/market/pound-at-week-high-dollar-sinks-as-risk-on-mood-cautiously-holds/1696669/,"The British pound hovered around a one-week high on Thursday as another parliamentary defeat for Prime Minister Boris Johnson made investors optimistic that a no-deal Brexit could be avoided, while a broader risk-on mood held back the dollar.

The dollar fell against most major currencies, though gained on the safe-haven yen, as the UK parliamentary vote, positive economic data in the United States and China and hopes for a de-escalation in Hong Kong’s political crisis lured investors to riskier assets.

The pound was at $1.2242, after its best day against the dollar in more than five months, and the euro also climbed 0.6% to $1.1033. Against a basket of currencies the dollar hit a one-week low of 98.390.

The British parliament voted on Wednesday to prevent Johnson from taking Britain out of the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31, but rejected his first bid to call a snap election two weeks before the scheduled exit.

“While there is no ‘all clear’ on market concerns, investor sentiment pulled back from extremes,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.

“Currency markets illustrated the shift…the U.S. dollar played a passive role as markets wait for the next trade tweets to drop.”

The Canadian dollar spiked sharply to C$1.3344 per dollar after the Bank of Canada left interest rates on hold and sounded less dovish than the market had expected.

The more upbeat mood cautiously held in morning trade in Asia, though few expected it to last long.

Brexit is still up in the air, with possible outcomes ranging from a no-deal exit from the EU to abandoning the whole endeavour.

“It’s important to keep in mind that the situation continues to look pretty bad,” J.P. Morgan analysts reminded investors in a market note, pointing out that Johnson is pushing for a snap election and a so-called “hard Brexit” remains an option.

The weak global trade outlook is also still a key worry, with U.S. President Donald Trump warning on Tuesday he would be “tougher” on Beijing in a second term if talks dragged on.

And it was not clear whether Hong Kong would return to calm after leader Carrie Lam withdraw an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests.

That caution kept the yen’s losses reasonably muted, though it did drift a little further lower to 106.42 per-dollar, its cheapest since Friday.

The yuan held on to Wednesday’s gains at around 7.1487 per dollar in offshore trade.

China will implement both broad and targeted cuts in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks “in a timely manner,” China’s cabinet said in a meeting on Wednesday, an indication that a cut in the key ratio aimed at boosting lending could be imminent.

It reported a net loss of Rs 7.78 billion for the half year ended September 30, 2018. Analysts attributed the widening of loss to high marketing spend.“India is a high priority market which forms the centrepiece of our global growth strategy,” Wong said. He did not share investment figures but said the company will continue with its marketing plan to tap “an aspirational audience in tier II regions who are fuelling the demand for smartphones in India”.“Our associations with sports, entertainment and lifestyle that connect with our primary target audience, will continue in India as we see it as one of the largest markets for our products,” Wong said.

In a huge blow to Indian IT professionals eyeing the US job market, the Trump administration suspended the most sought-after H-1B visas along with other types of foreign work visas until the end of 2020 to protect American workers in a crucial election year.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have dumped shares worth $1.4 billion since July 5 — they sold close to $400 million worth of stocks on Tuesday, provisional data showed. The broader market remains in deep distress — nearly 1,300 stocks have hit 52-week lows after the Budget announcement, exacerbating the six-quarter bearish trend. The benchmark Nifty has lost more than 5% since July 5.

The sharp and prolonged slowdown in the economy and poor corporate earnings have prompted investors to pare their portfolios. Credit strategists Suisse said cuts in earnings estimates have become much more broad-based in the last six months, with over 75% of the top 150 firms seeing cuts to FY20 estimates.

“While the aggregate quantum of cuts in the last three months is relatively minor, we expect the pace of cuts to pick up during the 1Q earnings season,” they wrote. Consumption demand is weak as seen from the lack-lustre sales of cars and two-wheelers. The higher surcharge on income of high-income individuals, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said, may affect demand for high-end real estate as the additional annual tax outgo is quite substantial at about 25-50% of the annual EMI related to a high-end property. “A further slowdown in sales of residential property may increase the current cash flow problems of certain real estate developers and by extension, the beleaguered housing finance companies,” they cautioned.

Q) It has been a roller coaster ride for the bulls in the second week of January. The index rose to fresh record highs and rose 2 percent for the week ended January 19? Do you think the momentum will continue?

A) We witnessed massive writing by option sellers in the past week. Usually, that means the markets may hold their own until expiration.

So, the momentum may continue till expiration due to the large buildup in Put options at most strike prices. However, expect profit booking to show up post-expiration.

Q) What should be the ideal strategy ahead of the Budget?

A) Markets always build up expectations from the budget on either economic or tax reform or measures to boost growth. Markets always over expect and therefore, one should not buy on the budget news.

Waiting for the market to discount the news and then acting is a better strategy. Typically, lighten up on positions before the budget and wait for a day after to resume one's actions.

Q) How is the market looking on the weekly as well as monthly charts?

A) Markets always pause after 5-6 weeks of rally. So, chances are that we will pause into the Budget. Since July, the Nifty has rallied for 5-weeks in a row and then corrected.

It did so into the August top and the same pattern also repeated into the November top after a 5-week rally in the month of October. We are also in the 13th month of a rally, and 13 is a Fibonacci number, Fibonacci months are often followed by market turns as well. The right Choice of stocks/sectors has been important throughout the last year and will continue to be so.

There are many underperforming stocks and sectors even in Midcaps. I am bullish on commodities and related stocks because the commodity cycle has turned up starting last year.

The reason is the falling dollar that is driving up commodity prices. Banks and interest rate sensitive sectors appear risky given that bond yields are rising closely across global markets.

No one is paying heed to this trend but it has not become persistent and is an active risk to the market.

Q) What should be the strategy -- buy on dips or sell on rallies in the coming week?

A) I believe that specifically for Midcap and small cap stocks it is a sell on rallies as their relative strength has been weakening in favor of large caps.

In Oct-Jan we did see meaningful outperformance of midcaps over large caps but that changed in the last 10 days.

After 10-Jan-2018, we have seen midcaps fall and large caps rise. This change was quite significant and should be noted in one’s asset allocation.

Q) Top 3-5 stocks which are looking attractive at current levels based on technical?

A) Vedanta, Tata Steel, Hindalco, with a one month time horizon could hold their own if commodity prices continue to rise.","small cap and midcap stocks are a sell on rallies as their relative strength has been weakening in favor of large caps. since July, the Nifty has rallied for 5-weeks in a row and then corrected. the right Choice of stocks/sectors has been important throughout the last year and will continue to be so. the falling dollar is driving up commodity prices.",Negative

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/home-loan-defaults-can-put-personal-wealth-in-jeopardy-here-is-how-5354461.html,"Last week, a very different question on real estate was posed to me – ""How costly can a home loan default be?""

Two events in Mumbai real estate have made the question pertinent.

1). Popularity of home purchases via subvention scheme: Earlier, most people bought apartments through a construction-linked plan (CLP). Under this plan, as construction happened, the buyer made his payments or serviced the loan taken for an apartment.

Between 2015 and 2019, things changed and subvention loans became the flavour. Schemes such as 5:80:15 were common. Under the arrangement, a buyer pays 5 percent, a lender then provides 80 percent funding but the pre-EMI until possession is paid by a developer. To provide this facility, the developer increases the total cost of the apartment for the buyer. On possession however, the buyer pays the remaining 15 percent.

Until the possession date however, the buyer has paid only 5 percent for the apartment plus stamp duty of 5 percent. In stock market parlance, subvention loans are the F&O of the real estate market. Reliable data doesn’t exist but my estimate is that 35k-55k deals in Mumbai Metropolitan Region have been done under subvention.

2). Falling home prices: It is no secret that home prices are falling. As I mentioned in my earlier column, the price fall is sharper and more public in the resale space in comparison to transactions done by the developer. The only debate is on the degree of the price fall. At the premium and luxury end – it is not uncommon to see prices in the resale market lower by 25 percent. At the mid-level housing level, the fall is not as steep.

These two factors are a lethal cocktail. Here is why: suppose an apartment under a construction-linked plan is available at Rs 1.75 crore, the cost under subvention would be close to Rs 2 crore – assuming that the possession date is around three years away. The difference in price is to make up for the expense that the developer will be bearing for paying your pre-EMI.

Now comes the price cut. The only thing is the price cut will be based on the construction-linked plan price: Rs 1.75 crore. The logic is simple: the resale buyer does not care whether the primary buyer booked the apartment through subvention or not. Psychologically, the primary buyer under CLP will just be taking a loss of only 6 percent even if he sells it at Rs 1.65 crore.

But the balance changes for buyers who have booked via a subvention loan. They will be acquiring an apartment which they know at the resale market is lower by Rs 35 lakh (purchase price of Rs 2 crore and resale price of Rs 1.65 crore).

Lenders have improved their subvention game. The bizarre practice of disbursing the entire amount at one go to the developer has been replaced to the sane practice of doing it on a construction-linked basis. As the developer demonstrates, he has completed a particular slab, only then a disbursement takes place.

The latest RBI norms pegged the loan-to-value ratio at 75 percent for loans above 75 lakh. Yet, it is hardly a secret that many leakages take place in this regard as well. Hence often the loan amount can reach even 85–90 percent of the agreement value.

I understand the lender perspective with regard to home loans in markets like Mumbai. The prices have either risen or remained stable.

Hence, LTV norms were rarely tested. Now the twin blows of falling home prices and reckless subvention loans have turned that premise upside down.

What happens now? Some homebuyers who availed loans under the subvention scheme will grudgingly continue paying their loans. But what of the people who have faced substantial salary cuts or lost their jobs? A home loan default is highly plausible.

That sets a series of actions that ends with an auction of the seized property. And it can get messy for the home buyer.

Loan agreements have a clause wherein if the realised value for the asset is not enough to recover the loan amount – the shortfall has to be compensated by the homebuyer itself.

An example of the clause is:

“If the net sum realized through the enforcement/sale/transfer of security is insufficient to cover the Borrower’s Dues, then without prejudice to the other rights and remedies of XXX under the loan documents and/or in law, the borrower agrees and undertakes to pay to XXX forthwith at XXX’s demand such amount as will make up the shortfall. The decision made by XXX with respect to matter under the Loan Documents shall be final and binding on the Borrower.”

Loosely put this reads: a home loan is almost a personal loan with the home as collateral. If the sale of the home is not enough to recover, his other assets can be in jeopardy. Far from a home providing a degree of security, an attempt at buying a home through tools like subvention in a falling market can put to risk all the other assets built over time.

Whether the personal asset recovery is legally enforceable by the lender in a smooth fashion is debatable. But the persistent harassment against the home buyer is not.

To the original question – “How costly can a home loan default be?”

The answer: The costliest decision of your life.

https://www.livemint.com/Money/xiuZYBHL9iXJ5IaViU1SeL/Wall-Street-opens-lower-as-growth-concerns-linger-Fed-in-fo.html,"New York: US stocks are falling in choppy trading, and the S&P 500 is down to its lowest in more than a year.Health insurers and hospitals are falling after a federal judge in Texas ruled that the 2010 Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. Retailers and technology stocks are also sinking.

Some of the biggest losses are going to utilities and real estate companies, which have done better than the rest of the market during the turbulence of the last three months.

KEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 skidded 39 points, or 1.5 percent, at 2,560 as of 1:50 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 363 points, or 1.5 percent, to 23,735. The Nasdaq composite fell 106 points, or 1.5 percent, to 6,803. The Russell 2000 index dipped 18 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,391.

The S&P 500 dropped in early trading and briefly recovered before falling again. It’s now on track for its lowest close since October 2017. The US benchmark index has fallen 12.6 percent since it set a record high in late September. The Russell 2000 has done significantly worse: it’s down 20 percent since it finished at its last record high at the end of August. Wall Street calls a 20 percent decline a “bear market,"" and it’s considered a major downturn.

The S&P Small Cap 600 index went into a bear market Friday as investors continue to lose confidence in the US economy’s growth prospects. Smaller companies are considered more vulnerable in a downturn than larger companies because they are more dependent on economic growth and tend to have higher levels of debt.

HEALTH SCARE: Hospital operator HCA dropped 2.5 percent to $123.51 while health insurer UnitedHealth lost 1.9 percent to $259.53. Centene, a health insurer that focuses on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act’s individual health insurance exchanges, fell 4.2 percent to $122.18 and Molina skidded 11.5 percent to $116.55.

Many experts expect the ruling will be overturned, but with the markets suffering steep declines in recent months, investors didn’t appear willing to wait and see.

BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.86 percent from 2.89 percent.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again Wednesday, the fourth increase of this year. It’s been raising rates since over the last three years, and investors will want to know if the Fed is scaling back its plans for further increases based on the turmoil in the stock market over the last few months and mounting evidence that world economic growth is slowing down.

Banks were mixed Monday despite the downward drift in bond yields, which makes lending less profitable for banks by forcing interest rates on loans such as mortgages lower. They have been hammered recently because of investors’ concerns about slowing growth and slower increases in interest rates.

The S&P 500’s index of financial stocks is down 10 percent in the last month, worse than any other part of the market. For the year it’s down 14 percent, much worse than the 4.2 percent decline in the S&P 500.

UK QUESTIONS: British Prime Minister Theresa May said Parliament will vote Jan. 14 on her deal setting terms for Britain’s departure from the European Union. She canceled a vote on the deal last week because it was clear legislators were going to reject it. May insists she can save the deal, but pressure is mounting for either a vote by lawmakers or a new referendum on the issue.

Britain is scheduled to leave the EU in late March, and if it does so without a deal in place governing their trade and economic relationships, it could bring huge disruptions to the British and European economies and financial markets.

OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX lost 0.9 percent. That means the DAX, which represents Europe’s largest single economy, is also in bear market territory. France’s CAC 40 and Britain’s FTSE 100 both fell 1.1 percent.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 index added 0.6 percent and the Kospi in South Korea gained 0.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was less than 0.1 percent lower. Both the Kospi and Hang Seng are in bear markets as well.

TRADE TENSIONS: China and the United States clashed again over their respective trade policies Monday, as China criticized what it calls a “unilateralist and protectionist"" approach to trade. The US ambassador to the World Trade Organization said those critiques were unwarranted. The two nations have been embroiled in a dispute over technology policy and other issues for most of this year. With no end to the conflict in sight, investors are growing more concerned that the tensions will drag down the already-slowing global economy.

ENERGY: Benchmark US crude fell 2.2 percent to $50.06 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, dipped 0.9 percent to $59.72 a barrel in London.

METALS: Gold rose 0.8 percent to $1,251.80 an ounce. Silver added 0.8 percent to $14.76 an ounce. Copper dipped 0.3 percent to $2.75 a pound.

CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 112.73 yen from 113.29 yen. The euro rose to $1.1358 from $1.1303. The British pound rose to $1.2626 from $1.2579.

http://www.financialexpress.com/market/on-the-edge-lenders-weigh-on-indian-stocks-local-scrips-take-a-beating-on-bank-sector-fallout/1089790/,"Indian stocks tumbled nearly 430 points on Tuesday, falling for the fifth straight session led by some big selling in banking stocks. The Sensex has lost 1,128.55 points and Rs 4.3 lakh crore of market capitalisation in the last five sessions. Although Asian markets posted gains, ostensibly shrugging off worries about a global trade war, Indian equities had a rough day with investors remaining concerned about the impact on banks of the fraud at Punjab National Bank (PNB).

A Bloomberg report in the afternoon on the possibility of Europe imposing a 25% tariff on $2.8 billion worth of American goods triggered some late selling and saw the Sensex and Nifty shed 1.27% and 1.06%, respectively. Since January 29, when it hit its recent peak of 11,171.55 points, the Nifty has yielded as much as 8.55%. Since February 1, when the Union Budget for 2018-19 was announced, the Sensex has given up some 7%.

After pumping in close to $8 billion in 2017, foreign portfolio investors are lying low and have so far invested only a meagre $309 million in Indian equities in 2018; they have been selling regularly since January 23. Domestic institutions, on the other hand, have been net buyers of equities worth $2.6 billion this year.

Banking stocks were beaten down on Tuesday, explaining the sharper fall in the Sensex vis-a-vis the Nifty, as financial sector stocks account for 40% of its weightage. The Bank Nifty index was down 1.5%, while the BSE Bankex shed 1.44% after the Serious Fraud Investigations Office summoned the heads of all lenders to Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi group entities, for further information on the defaulting entities and their mechanics.

Market insiders don’t rule out more skeletons falling out of the banks’ cupboards and this concern seems to have rattled investors.

Earlier in the day, Asian markets had shrugged off the protectionist stance adopted by US President Donald Trump on imports of commodities like aluminium and steel. Most Asian indices ended with strong gains after the sell-off on Monday. The Hang Seng closed 2.1% stronger, while the Nikkei and Kospi ended 1.8% and 1.5% up.

Indian equities had returned 28.75% in rupee terms and 37% in dollar terms in calendar 2017 but have seen a sharp reversal in trend in 2018. The Nifty has registered a decline of 2.1% since the start of the year to close at its lowest level so far in 2018 at 10,215.91. This has translated into poor returns on a year-to-date basis for Indian equities vis-a-vis other prominent global markets, as measured by returns on their benchmark indices. In fact, with a negative return of 4.3%, India finds itself at the bottom of the table, in good measure also due to a 1.7% decline in the value of the rupee against the dollar. Brazil has been the best performing market on a year-to-date basis this year with dollar returns of 15%, aided by a 2% gain in its currency against the dollar.

Despite the skittish sentiment in the market, though, analysts aren’t too perturbed. ICICI Securities wrote: “Based on various factors, our earlier analysis concluded that the fear factor is not extreme currently and is showing signs of receding.” The brokerage said it remains overweight on domestic cyclical recovery and wary of global trade environment and capital flows and added it would be fearful of a capitulation if growth outlook were to weaken in a rising inflation and deteriorating fiscal environment.

On Tuesday, when Indian equities lost about Rs 1.75 lakh crore in market capitalisation, the big losers were state run lenders Canara Bank (-5.1%), PNB (-3.15%), private banks like ICICI Bank (-2.84%) and Axis Bank (-2.3%). Sun Pharma also ended 3% down, despite hopes its issues with the US food and Drug Administration may finally get resolved.

A big fall was seen in the stock of Adani Enterprises, which lost 7.5% after a member of the ruling alliance alluded to its bank exposure running into thousands of crores turning into non-performing assets. The company issued a statement later in the day to counter these allegations.

His appeal comes after scores of Shiv Sena workers thrashed a man and tonsured his head in Wadala area for posting a controversial comment on Facebook against Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.

“Calm, composed, aggressive about delivering promises and serving the people. Let’s win people. Trolls lose anyway,” Aaditya, who is the son of CM Uddhav, said on Tuesday. He represents the Worli seat in the Vidhan Sabha.

Aaditya said he got to know of the untoward and angry reaction to a ‘nasty, low life troll’ who used uncivilized language against the CM’s effort to maintain religious harmony and remove fear from Maharashtra about the new citizenship law. He said the Shiv Sena workers should focus on silencing the chaos, divisions, fear, hate and keep people united. “Our answer is to create jobs and revive the economy,” he pointed out.

“Law and order is a subject of police and shouldn’t be taken by anyone into his/her hands. Answering trolls who are nasty, threatening and abusive should not be our job,” Aaditya added.

https://www.financialexpress.com/market/take-over-franklin-templeton-management-investigate-investments-stock-brokers-body-asks-govt/1941307/,"Seeking urgent steps to safeguard investors’ interest due to Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund’s decision to shut down six debt schemes, stock brokers’ association ANMI has asked the government and capital markets regulator Sebi to appoint a high-powered committee to take over the management of the fund house and examine its investment decision.

In a letter dated April 26 the Finance Ministry and Sebi, the Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI), which represents 900 stock brokers, has also requested for steps to safeguard further erosion of investor wealth and to inform the investors of these six schemes in a time-bound manner about modalities for them getting back their investments.

Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund closed six of its debt funds on Thursday, citing redemption pressures and lack of liquidity in the bond markets. These schemes are Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund.

The decision has led to concerns about the fate of investments and mutual fund industry body AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds in India) rushed in on Friday to assuage the same. In its letter dated April 26, ANMI said that closure of the six schemes by the fund house has sent shock waves to the entire mutual fund investing community.

The association alleged that Franklin Templeton MF had heavily invested in low rated papers in the debt market and had also put money into several lesser known companies. “Based on portfolio details published by FTMF of these six funds as on March 31, 2020, it appears that the profile of some of the companies FTMF chose to invest and the terms of those invested is questionable.

“When market slowdown gripped the economy, there was a substantial price erosion in low rated papers in the debt market, where FTMF had heavily invested forcing them to stop the redemption,” ANMI has alleged. Besides, substantial investment in low-rated papers, ANMI also alleged that the investment made by the fund house are in contravention to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) norms.

With regard to Franklin Ultra Short Term Bond Fund, ANMI alleged that 70 per cent fund corpus has been invested by Franklin Templeton MF in securities, which are maturing after 1 to 9 years (2021 onwards up to 2029). It further alleged that the investment pattern is completely in contravention with the Sebi norms, which mandate investment duration of 3-6 months for ultra short duration funds.

“FTMF has taken long dated securities that normally have lesser liquidity compared with short dated securities. These long dated securities with substantial investment in low rated papers is the real cause of illiquidity that has caused closure of six funds of FTMF,” it alleged.

ANMI has also accused the top management and trustees of Franklin Templeton MF of having remained “mute spectators of such blatant violation of Sebi regulations”. However, the fund house’s President Sanjay Sapre, in a note to investors on Monday, said these schemes followed a consistent investment strategy of investing in investment grade papers across the credit rating spectrum, that is to say, from AAA through to A rated papers.

This strategy served the schemes and its investors well till recent times and the schemes were able to generate significant cash flows even during the last six months, which were more turbulent times for the credit markets, he said.

On Friday also, ANMI had urged Finance Ministry and Sebi to take swift action for protecting the hard-earned savings of lakhs of investors who had invested in Franklin Templeton MF.

https://www.livemint.com/news/world/markets-enter-new-phase-where-cash-is-all-that-matters-11584616259458.html,"A rush for cash shook the financial system Wednesday, as companies and investors hunkered down for a prolonged economic stall, taking the recent market turmoil into a new, more troubling liquidation phase.

Investors sold nearly everything they could in the most all-encompassing market drawdown since the darkest days of the 2008 financial crisis. Short-term money markets at the heart of the financial system were strained and large companies have drawn heavily on credit facilities while they have them.

The selling engulfed stocks, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1,338.46 points, or 6.3%, to 19898.92, its first close below 20000 in more than three years. The blue-chip index, which dropped more than 2,300 points earlier in the session, has fallen by about a third in just the past month.

Wednesday’s selloff crushed shares of companies as varied as airlines, restaurants, banks and retailers. The declines showed the extent to which investors are worried that the novel coronavirus pandemic—which has already forced airlines to cut flights and businesses to close—could send the economy into a recession.

Shares of Boeing Inc. tumbled 18%, while stock in Citigroup lost nearly 10% in value. A drop of more than 20% in the price of oil slammed shares of energy companies. Exxon Mobil Inc. fell 10% and has halved so far this year.

Several stocks fell so sharply that exchanges had to temporarily halt trading in them. One such stock, Alaska Air Group Inc., tumbled 23% Wednesday. Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants Inc. slid 19%. Coty Inc., whose beauty portfolio includes Sally Hansen, dropped 31%.

In debt markets, the sell-everything approach drove down prices of safe investment grade bonds and government debt alongside stocks and commodities of nearly all stripes. Normally, when investors turn away from risky assets, they buy safer government debt—or if they are really frightened, gold. Investors appear to be putting their trust in only the shortest-term government bonds or cash.

“When even silver and gold are getting crushed, that’s a panicked drawing of liquidity,"" said Rob Arnott, founder of California-based investment firm Research Affiliates. “In the U.S., you can’t find toilet paper anywhere: This is the capital markets equivalent of that.""

Yields on one-month U.S. Treasury bills, a close equivalent to cash, fell to as low as 0.0033% from 0.31% at the start of the week, their lowest level in several years.

“There are very few places to hide. The tightening in financial conditions is happening across markets,"" said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. He pointed to strong selling of bond funds that own the debt of the safest big companies, which is causing corporate borrowing costs to rise despite central bank efforts to do the opposite.

Another factor pushing government bond yields higher: As investors dash for safety, they are contending with a potential massive new supply of government bonds that will be necessary to fund stimulus measures, including $1 trillion of spending discussed in Washington Tuesday. In the simplest terms, a greater supply of bonds should cause prices to fall and yields to rise.

The rush to cash, meanwhile, has put strain on money markets in the U.S. and globally. The difference between the yield on the three-month Treasury bill and interbank lending rates, known as the Ted spread, jumped above 1 percentage point, according to FactSet, a level not seen since early 2009. In good times, the difference between the rates, which reflects how easy it is for banks to get hold of short-term borrowing, is negligible.

The dollar, meanwhile, has surged against all currencies, as the cost to borrow dollars has risen substantially.

People and companies need cash to cover rent, bills and other fixed costs at a time when businesses and schools are shutting doors and sending staff home across the U.S. and Europe to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus.

“If you think about it from a small business standpoint, a big business standpoint, a fund manager standpoint—liquidity and cash is going to be king,"" said John Briggs, head of strategy, Americas, at NatWest Markets. “Take Italy: They’ve just hard-stopped the eighth largest economy in the world. We’ve never seen anything like this.""

The Bank of England said Wednesday it would provide an unlimited amount of financing in commercial paper markets.

Small and medium-size companies in the U.S. and Europe are likely to be among the hardest hit because they have less room for error. Eric Lonergan, a portfolio manager at M&G Investments, said smaller companies in the U.K. were already delaying payments to their creditors if they could.

“I think the entire economic system is trying to conserve cash at the moment,"" he said.

Sushil Wadhwani, chief investment officer of QMA Wadhwani, a U.K.-based hedge fund, said the rational thing for individual companies was to access credit lines. Pension funds, meanwhile, which are normally built to ride out long market disruptions, may also be joining the cash dash.

“For pension funds, it is sell anything you can sell to build up reserves so you can tell your trustees that you have enough cash to pay pensions over the next nine or 10 months,"" he said.

“The longer this goes on, the more bankruptcy you get and the more unemployment you get,"" he said.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-stalling-massive-imf-liquidity-boost-over-iran-china-sources-5152111.html,"US opposition to opening new avenues of funding for Iran and China is preventing the International Monetary Fund from deploying a powerful tool to help countries fight the economic impact of the coronavirus, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

A massive IMF liquidity injection through issuance of new Special Drawing Rights, something akin to a central bank ""printing"" new money, has the backing of many finance ministers, prominent economists, and non-profit groups.

It could provide hundreds of billions of dollars in urgently needed foreign exchange reserves for all of the IMF's 189 member countries, and finance officials are debating the issue during this week's virtual IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings.

But sources said the United States, the IMF's dominant shareholder, actively opposed the new fundraising.

The Trump administration does not want Iran and China to have access to billions of dollars in new resources with no conditions, two of the sources familiar with the IMF's deliberations said, asking not to be identified given the sensitivity of the issue.

They added that the IMF's move would give even wealthy countries new assets that are not necessarily needed. Even embattled Venezuela would get an allocation, although the IMF has blocked Caracas' access to its SDRs while international recognition of its government remains unclear.

India also opposes a new SDR allocation, the two sources said, but New Delhi's reasons have not been made known. A spokesman for India's Finance Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

MONEY FOR NOTHING?

SDRs, based on dollars, euro, yen, sterling and yuan, are the IMF's official unit of exchange. Member countries hold them at the Fund in proportion to their shareholdings.

The IMF last approved a $250-billion new allocation of SDRs in 2009, boosting liquidity for cash-strapped countries during the last financial crisis.

Doing so again now could provide more flexibility to the 102 countries that have already sought IMF emergency loans and grants, and allow aid to flow to high-debt countries that can't qualify for new IMF loans, such as Argentina and Zimbabwe.

An SDR expansion has attracted some celebrity advocates, such as investor George Soros and U2 lead singer Bono's ONE anti-poverty organization, along with trade unions and faith-based groups.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva floated the idea of a $500 billion SDR issuance in March to G20 finance officials. But the group said in a statement after a videoconference on Wednesday there was ""no consensus on the issue.""

Georgieva, who also has acknowledged U.S. resistance, told a news conference on Wednesday: ""What we are concentrating on, is to act decisively with what we have, and where there is full consensus among members. We recognize that there are other options to be explored, and we will continue to do so,"" she said.

Among these efforts is persuading wealthier countries to donate or lend their existing, unused SDRs to IMF lending facilities for poor countries. The Fund is trying to triple the resources in its Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust to $18 billion, she said.

Some say $500 billion is too little. Former U.S. Treasury secretary Larry Summers and former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who both pushed for the 2009 SDR allocation, called on Wednesday for a $1 trillion-plus SDR issuance.

""If ever there was a moment for an expansion of the international money known as Special Drawing Rights, it is now,"" they wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post Wednesday.

On Tuesday, the IMF said the recession sparked by the virus would be far deeper than the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, shrinking the global economy by 3.0% in 2020.

HIGH TENSIONS

The Trump administration's opposition comes at a time when U.S. tension with China is running high over the causes of the virus and a long-running trade war. U.S.-Iran tension nearly boiled over into armed conflict in January.

The U.S. Treasury Department has pressed the IMF instead to focus on quickly deploying its $1 trillion in existing resources, including expanding emergency loans and grants to more than 100 countries that have sought aid.

A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment specifically on the SDR allocations, but said the agency supported a variety of efforts at the IMF to provide rapid, targeted assistance to countries in need.

""We support accelerating IMF procedures, higher access from the IMF‘s emergency lending facilities, and support from donors for the IMF‘s assistance to low income countries, including grants to help these countries make debt payments to the IMF,"" the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

PATIENT APPROACH

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire argued in favor of a new SDR allocation of about $500 billion, saying in a statement to the IMF's steering committee it would provide an extra $16 billion to low-income nations that could be ""decisive"" in battling the virus.

Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz, a former World Bank chief economist, said new SDRs would not cost U.S. taxpayers anything.

""And if we can help emerging markets and developing countries, it will rebound to us in terms of health and in terms of the economic recovery,"" he said.

IMF officials, while acknowledging that a deal for a new SDR allocation is unlikely this week, are taking a patient approach, hoping to eventually persuade U.S. Treasury officials of the merits of the move.

""Nothing is off the table,"" IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath told Reuters on Tuesday.","sources: the united states is the dominant shareholder of the IMF. the move would give even wealthy countries new assets that are not necessarily needed. the IMF last approved a $250-billion new allocation of SDRs in 2009. the move could provide more flexibility to the 102 countries that have already sought IMF loans. a spokesman for india also opposes a new allocation of SDRs, the sources say.",Negative

The U.S. currency hit the highest in almost three years against the euro. Against the antipodeans, the greenback rose toward a 17-year high against the Australian dollar and approached an 11-year peak against the New Zealand dollar as investors dumped riskier assets.

U.S. stock futures and oil prices came under further pressure early in Asian trading, which pushed the dollar higher as more people are placed under lockdown in an effort to contain the virus, traders said. Investors are also hoping for big fiscal spending to mitigate the damage to the global economy, but uncertainty about the spread of the virus is likely to support the dollar in the future.

""We've moved from risk off to a phase where major players are competing with each other for the safety of holding dollars in cash,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, FX strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. ""There are still a lot of investors who need to sell riskier assets, and they want to hold their money in dollars.""

The dollar rose 0.96% against the pound GBP=D3 to $1.1559, approaching the strongest since at least 1985. The dollar gained 0.33% to EUR=EBS $1.0360, the strongest since April 2017. The greenback closed in on multi-year highs against the Australian AUD=D3 and New Zealand NZD=D3 dollars. Against the yen, the currency rose 0.11% to 110.92.

Investors have been liquidating positions in safe-havens and other riskier investments to keep their money in dollars due to the uncertainty caused by the epidemic. Major central banks have ramped up efforts to ease a global dollar funding crunch, but the U.S. currency remains in demand due to the high degree of uncertainty about the unknown flu-like virus.

The dollar has also surged against many emerging market currencies, highlighting the growing sense of risk aversion across the globe. Early in Asian trading, the dollar rose to a record high against the Mexican peso MXN. So far this year the dollar is up 26% against Brazil's real BRL, up around 8% against the Korean won KRW and up 15% against the Indonesian rupiah IDR.

Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Senate are trying to complete a deal on a $1 trillion-plus bill aimed at stemming the coronavirus pandemic's economic fallout for workers, industries and small businesses. But there was no sign of an overarching deal between negotiators, despite Republicans' claims of bipartisan agreement on specific issues including unemployment insurance and small business assistance.

Nearly one in three Americans were ordered to stay home on Sunday to slow the spread of the disease, while Italy banned internal travel as deaths there reached 5,476. U.S. President Donald Trump has approved disaster deceleration requests from New York and Washington, while St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard warned unemployment could reach 30% unless more was done fiscally.

Global markets have been upended in recent weeks as the coronavirus spread from central China and governments responded with increasingly strict restrictions on travel and daily life, disrupting businesses and prompting consumers to stay at home and rein in spending. The virus has now been reported in more than 100 countries and has claimed more than 8,000 lives.

http://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/china-asks-its-citizens-not-to-travel-to-maldives/1052421/,"China today warned its citizens not to travel to the Maldives for holidays due to the political turmoil there, in a setback to beleaguered President Abdulla Yameen whose country’s economy relies heavily on Chinese tourists. The Maldives has plunged into political crisis as the Supreme Court yesterday asked Yameen to comply with its order to release political prisoners and reinstate dissident lawmakers. This led to a tense standoff as Yameen has not yet implemented the apex court’s ruling leading to agitations by the Opposition parties. “China is closely following the developments in the Maldives,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told media here asking the Maldivian government and the political parties to resolve differences through dialogue while maintaining national stability and social order.

He, however, declined to join the calls by the United Nations, the US and India asking Yameen who is widely regarded as pro-China to implement the Supreme Court order. “What happened in theMaldives is Maldives’ internal affair. China supports the relevant parties in the Maldives to properly resolve their differences through dialogue and consultation and maintain national stability and social order,” he said. But at the same time he said China has issued a “security reminder” asking its tourists not to travel to the Maldives in view of the situation which could drastically affect the island nation which relies heavily on tourism revenue.

China’s travel advisory coming ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday season starting from February 15 is likely to deter thousands of Chinese who travel to the Maldives during the week-long holiday. Chinese tourits constitute about 30 per cent of the Maldives tourist arrivals. The Spring Festival holiday, which includes Chinese New Year celebrations is peak season for Chinese citizens to travel to the Maldives for tourism, Geng said.

Currently, over 6,000 Chinese tourists were reportedly holidaying in the island nation. “In light of the relevant situation we advise the Chinese tourists in the Maldives to closely follow the situation and strengthen security awareness. At the same time, we advise those people who plan to go to the Maldives not to travel to go there before the situation get stabilised,” he said. President Yameen in recent years has allowed largescale Chinese investments and signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which came under sharp criticism from opposition parties and also raised concerns in India due its strategic location in the Indian Ocean.

China views the Maldives as key to its Maritime Silk Road project in the Indian Ocean as it has already acquired Hambantota port in Sri Lanka and Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. Former president and current opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed, who was controversially convicted of a terrorism charge and jailed for 13 years in 2015, termed the FTA as “disgraceful” and said it was not in the Maldivian national interest.

Nasheed, the country’s first democratically elected leader, was toppled in 2012. He was barred from contesting elections after his 2015 terrorism conviction, which was internationally criticised as politically motivated. He has been in exile since 2016, when he left on prison leave for medical treatment. He is currently in Colombo, meeting Maldivian dissidents based in Sri Lanka.",the maldives has plunged into political crisis as the Supreme Court asked president to comply with its order to release political prisoners and reinstate dissident lawmakers. this led to a tense standoff as Yameen has not yet implemented the apex court’s ruling leading to agitations by the Opposition parties. china has issued a “security reminder” asking its tourists not to travel to the Maldives due to the situation.,Negative

New Delhi: India has an unprecedented opportunity to establish itself as an alternative destination for mobile phone manufacturing and become an export hub as global giants look at de-risking manufacturing from China in the post-COVID-19 era, a strategy document by ICEA-EY said on Thursday. The document, which has been shared with government authorities, has outlined a three-phase ' Restart, Restore and Resurgence ' strategy to help India achieve exports of USD 100 billion in mobile phones and nearly US 40 billion in components by 2025.The document said India appears to have all necessary ingredients to encourage mobile manufacturing at scale and boost exports from the country but what appears to be missing is the policy support to attract lead firms, incentivise production and unveil measures that provide cost competitiveness to industry or help offset the disabilities suffered by Indian firms vis-a-vis Vietnam and China.It is estimated that India suffers from various disabilities like high cost of power, tax and ease of doing business. This renders India almost 10 per cent and 20 per cent less competitive than Vietnam and China, respectively. India must address these disability issues in the long run, it added.In the short run, the government should endeavour to offset these disabilities by providing incentives which are WTO-compliant, easy to implement and help India take off from the export runway, it said.India spent USD 18.7 billion on import of mobile phones and parts, compared to exports of USD 2.0 billion of mobile phones and parts. India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo lauded the government's push to mobile phone manufacturing through production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) and Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme.""The recently announced trilogy of schemes -- PLI, SPECS and EMC 2.0 -- have laid the foundation for starting something big. The impact of the PLI scheme will be visible before the end of 2020-21,"" he said.The document noted that five companies (Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Oppo and Vivo), which account for over 80 per cent of the mobile phone revenues, globally are already present in India. While they have started assembly in India to primarily serve the domestic market, assembling of mobile phones continues to be centred in China (including Hong Kong) and Vietnam.""However, these brands are keen and capable to provide India with global market access. Some of these global brands have begun smartphone exports from India since 2018. They await policy certainty to increase global supply from India,"" the document said.The spread of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown of countries saw supply chains being disrupted, which has forced global firms to de-risk manufacturing out of China and diversify across multiple countries, as against reliance on a single source of production and procurement. Furthermore, the recent trade dispute between the US and China gave India an opportunity to plug itself as the third mobile phone assembler in the world (apart from China and Vietnam).""The post-COVID-19 era might thus present India an unprecedented opportunity to establish itself as an alternative destination for manufacturing to follow on the path of becoming a net exporter,"" it said adding that India needs to move ""purposefully"" and approach companies and supply chains in a targeted manner and address their particular concerns with alacrity.Hari Om Rai, chairman and MD of Lava International, said homegrown companies need support in two areas to be able to capture a larger chunk of the market.""One is skill building, in terms of design, supply chain and manufacturing. And second is ability to access the markets of the world. I think these two areas, if we can get support, eventually we will be global champions and global champions from India are going to emerge,"" he said.The document suggested that from May to July 2020, focus may be kept on restarting operations and reaching 100 per cent capacity, and then till November, the country should aim to restore complete normalcy including supply chain, employee workforce, input imports, and normalise operations for both domestic supplies as well as export markets.In the period from December 2020 to 2025, India needs to chart its path towards becoming a leading exporter of mobile phones in the world, while pushing mobile exports as a top ranking Indian export from where it currently stands, it added.""Today, India stands at the cusp of a great opportunity to ignite the mobile phone manufacturing, bring global value chain investors in India, and become leading exporters of mobile phones in the world,"" EY India Indirect Tax Partner Telecom sector Bipin Sapra said.Sapra added that the introduction of the incentive schemes such as PLI, SPECS and EMC will bring resurgence in the manufacturing environment and create a competitive global ecosystem for India to capture the global market share of mobile phones, parts and accessories.","restart, restore and resurgence' strategy to help india achieve exports of USD 100 billion in mobile phones and nearly US 40 billion in components by 2025. india suffers from various disabilities like high cost of power, tax and ease of doing business. this renders India almost 10 per cent and 20 per cent less competitive than Vietnam and China, respectively.",Negative

I do not think we are in a very frothy valuation . For equity, there could be pockets of diamond valuation and there could be pockets of brass valuation, forget about silver valuation, says the Chairman, MOFSLLet us start with Berkshire. That is something less domestic, more international and thematic. My thought process is that Buffett in his wisdom is trying to change himself with the changing times. He denounced aviation stocks for 20-25 years and then finally went and embraced all the four airlines at 10% each and finally sold it out, again at a loss. So I only hope gold does not become the same kind of a trade for him.It is a a zero interest rate, zero inflation environment. Earlier, our thinking was that gold is an inflation hedge but there is no inflation. So there is no logical need for a hedge. There could be liquidity. I mean there is no other place to park the money. There are no bonds. But gold is not a yielding asset and maybe there is a fear of inflation coming back but that fear is going on for the last 10 years. I do not have any extra insight that inflation is imminent. I do not see anything else. There is no other reason why gold should go up but maybe the wiser people like Buffett and all are fearful of inflation coming back, which I do not have any clue about. I have learnt one thing from him. If you do not understand something, do not do it. So I would still stay on the side of not understanding gold. I would rather stay away and that would be my way of seeing it.I think both have been driven by very different forces. I would think that bullishness in gold prices are driven by fear of inflation. There is no inflation. There is actually deflationary pressure but there is a massive fear of inflation and you cannot fight with fear.Equities on the other hand are being driven by the fact that there is no yield in the bond side. The 10-year paper is trading at say 60 bps and so effectively, the bond PE is 150. So what is the harm in buying equities? A basket of equity like I am talking about with indices at 20-25 PE multiple which also has growth and 2-2.5% dividend yield. That is the argument for stocks against bonds and this is very logical so far and liquidity is also there. Because of that, if you see the performing part of the equities in the world -- be it FAANG or others -- the growth includes the valuation of equities which are going through the roof.I can see the bond versus equity argument but I do not see that unless this fear is well thought through, that yes there is imminent upsurgence of inflation in the world, the commercial thinking is someday inflation will raise its head, but I am not that competent.We are talking about broad valuation. So valuation at about 65% to GDP. We are at about Rs 152-153 lakh crore market cap on our Rs 200 plus crore kind of GDP in the current year. I do not think we are in a very frothy valuation. There could be pockets of diamond valuation and there could be pockets of brass valuation, forget about silver valuation.The market is always made up of all sorts of things but I do not see that kind of exuberance that we saw in 2008. We have seen three of them. In 1992, you did not have to ask whether markets are overvalued. You do not need these questions in 1992, 2000 for tech companies, in 2008 for the broad market. My market cap to GDP -- let me remind you -- was 180%. What is US today was India in 2008. Our market cap was Rs 73 lakh crore and GDP was Rs 45 lakh crore in 2007-08 when we peaked off. Today my GDP is Rs 200 lakh crore and my market cap is Rs 152 lakh crore. Yes there can be pockets -- a little bit here and there -- but I do not think the broad market is that badly off.","if you do not understand something, do not do it,' says chairman of MOFSLLet.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/coronavirus-pandemic-world-bank-urges-countries-to-go-for-comprehensive-policies-to-boost-long-term-growth-5350791.html,"The World Bank on Tuesday urged countries to go for comprehensive policies to boost long-term growth along with short term measures to address health emergencies and secure core public services in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, amid indications that 60 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty in 2020.

The scope and speed with which the COVID-19 pandemic and economic shutdowns have devastated the poor around the world are unprecedented in modern times, World Bank Group President David Malpass said.

""Current estimates show that 60 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty in 2020. These estimates are likely to rise further, with the reopening of advanced economies the primary determinant,"" he told reporters during a conference call as the World Bank released analytical chapters from its flagship Global Economic Prospects report.

Noting that the coronavirus pandemic and the economic shutdowns are dealing a severe blow to the global economy, especially poorer countries, the report said developing nations and the international community can take steps now to speed up recovery after the worst of the health crisis has passed and blunt long-term adverse effects.

""Policy choices made today - including greater debt transparency to invite new investment, faster advances in digital connectivity, and a major expansion of cash safety nets for the poor - will help limit the damage and build a stronger recovery,"" Malpass said.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""The financing and building of productive infrastructure are among the hardest-to-solve development challenges in the post-pandemic recovery. We need to see measures to speed litigation and the resolution of bankruptcies and reform the costly subsidies, monopolies and protected state-owned enterprises that have slowed development,"" he said.

Short-term response measures to address the health emergency and secure core public services will need to be accompanied by comprehensive policies to boost long-term growth, including by improving governance and business environments, and expanding and improving the results of investment in education and public health, the World Bank report said.

To make future economies more resilient, many countries will need systems that can build and retain more human and physical capital during the recovery - using policies that reflect and encourage the post-pandemic need for new types of jobs, businesses and governance systems, it said.

According to the report, in the long-term, the pandemic will leave lasting damage through multiple channels, including lower investment; erosion of physical and human capital due to closure of businesses and loss of schooling and jobs; and a retreat from global trade and supply linkages.

These effects will lower potential output - the output an economy can sustain at full employment and capacity - and labor productivity well into the future. Pre-existing vulnerabilities, fading demographic dividends, and structural bottlenecks will amplify the long-term damage of deep recessions associated with the pandemic, it said.

""When the pandemic struck, many emerging and developing economies were already vulnerable due to record-high debt levels and much weaker growth. Combined with structural bottlenecks, this will amplify the long-term damage of deep recessions associated with the pandemic,"" said Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, World Bank Vice President for Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions.

""Urgent measures are needed to limit the damage, rebuild the economy, and make growth more robust, resilient and sustainable,"" Pazarbasioglu said.

During the recovery period, countries will need to calibrate the winding down of public support and should be targeting broader development challenges. The Bank analysis discusses the importance of allowing an orderly allocation of new capital toward sectors that are productive in the new post-pandemic structures that emerge.

To succeed in this, countries will need reforms that allow capital and labour to adjust relatively fast - by speeding the resolution of disputes, reducing regulatory barriers, and reforming the costly subsidies, monopolies and protected state-owned enterprises that have slowed development, the report said.

https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronavirus-scare-foreign-tourist-arrivals-hit-record-low-in-february/story/399590.html,"The devastating impact of coronavirus on tourism sector can be gauged with the foreign tourist arrivals data. In February 2020, 1.01 million foreign tourists arrived in India compared to 1.08 million in February 2019, registering a year-on-year (y-o-y) de-growth of -6.6 per cent. This was the sharpest decline since 2015 and also the first in the month of February. In January it grew 1.3 per cent on a y-o-y basis.

On a month-on-month (m-o-m) basis, tourists' arrivals in February fell 9.2 per cent compared to 8.9 per cent in January 2020. Though the intensity of the fall is hard to ignore, but going by the m-o-m data since 2015 this may not be a very unusual trend. India normally observes a healthy flow (a double-digit growth) of foreign tourists during October, November and December, which starts coming down from January till May and again improves during monsoons.

Foreign exchange earnings (FEEs) during the month were Rs 18,281 crore as compared to Rs 17,912 crore in February 2019, posting a scanty y-o-y growth of 2.1 per cent. This was after a double-digit y-o-y growth since September 2019. The growth rate in FEEs during January- February 2020 was 7.1 per cent over the corresponding period last year. FEEs in US$ terms in February was US$ 2.6 billion compared to US$ 2.5 billion during the month of February 2019.

Bangladesh tops the charts for foreign tourist arrivals in the country with highest share of 21.4 per cent in 2018. This was followed by tourists from United States with a share of 13.3 per cent and United Kingdom with 9.75 per cent. The top ten source countries accounted for nearly 66 per cent of tourist's inflow including Australia (3.28 per cent) and China (2.67 per cent).

What started as an epidemic in China has now become a global pandemic. China reported its first COVID-19 case to the World Health Organisation on December 31, 2019 and since then the count has been rising. There have now been over 5.75 lakhs confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,654 deaths globally.

By end of January, China had 9,720 confirmed coronavirus cases and there were only 106 confirmed cases outside China from 19 countries. The percentage share of foreign tourist arrivals in India during January among the top 15 source countries was highest from Bangladesh (18.68 per cent) followed by USA (15.34 per cent), UK (9.68 per cent). Canada had a share of 4.51 per cent, Australia (4.01 per cent), China (2.86 per cent) and France (2.54 per cent). As on February, the COVID-19 cases in China jumped to 79,394 with 6,009 confirmed cases outside China. This restricted the inflow of tourists from China too as the country disappeared from India's top 15 list in the February. The highest was again from Bangladesh with 21.19 per cent share followed by USA (12.68 per cent), UK (11.39 per cent) and Canada (4.46 per cent).

Total number of coronavirus cases in India has risen to 979 claiming 25 lives. The government has imposed a 21-day lockdown in the whole country on March 25th. All international passenger flight operations will remain closed till April 14 in the wake of the three-week nationwide lockdown imposed in light of the coronavirus outbreak in the country. As per the report of 3rd Tourism Satellite Account for India prepared in 2018 for the reference year 2015-16(using new base year, 2011-12 figures of CSO) the contribution of tourism to GDP was estimated around 5.2 per cent in 2015/16. With a lockdown ahead in India and restricted movements of people across the globe, tourist arrivals will be badly hit in the month of March and April and so will the foreign exchange earnings. Now, with roughly a 5 per cent share one can imagine the loss to the economy.

https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/cover-story/no-exemption-from-pain/story/402205.html,"Ever wondered why your neighbourhood chicken shop does not have your favourite meat, or even if it does, is pricing it too high? Amit Saraogi, Managing Director of Kolkata-based Rs 550 crore Anmol Feeds Pvt Ltd, a feed supplier to the poultry industry, says it is the complete breakdown of India's chicken economy - hatcheries to feed suppliers to commercial farms to bulk suppliers to retailers - that has caused this crisis. The exemption it enjoys as part of the agriculture and allied sector has not helped either. The problem started with a rumour in February that the bird may spread cor0navirus. This hit demand during the month.

By the time the lockdown was announced in March, ""the Indian poultry industry had suffered a Rs 15,000 crore loss as bulk suppliers abandoned the birds and farmers sold them for almost free,"" says Saraogi. The demand is limping back but there is another problem. There are few birds, which means less demand for poultry feed, but Saraogi is struggling to meet even this demand as operations of his raw material suppliers - solvent companies that produce maize gluten, rice bran oil, etc - have been hit. The reason: they are not getting their raw material as soybean harvest, operations of rice millers, etc, have been hit due to labour shortage, administrative restrictions and shortage of trucks and truck drivers. The cash flow situation in the poultry industry is so bad that Saraogi says ""it will take at least three months, after the lockdown gets over completely, for it to normalise"".

Not all industries that have been allowed to function during the lockdown are facing such a catastrophic situation, but on April 4, Pawan Kumar Agarwal, Secretary of the Consumer Affairs Department of the government of India, shared a suggestive list of 71 companies that deal in essential goods with chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories. The idea was to ensure that none of these companies faced any difficulty in resuming production and moving goods across the country. The list included 48 food and grocery companies like Adani Wilmar Ltd, Britannia India Ltd and Pepsico India, 17 organised retail chains like Reliance Fresh and Mother Dairy, and seven e-commerce firms, including Amazon, Flipkart and Swiggy. Despite the clear instructions, none of these players can claim seamless, full-fledged operations across India. For instance, PepsiCo could make its food plants in Punjab and Maharashtra operational, but the one in West Bengal is awaiting clearance to restart operations even as Business Today goes to press. With central advisories themselves being revised often, and implementation patchy across states, even the agri-food sector which, along with pharmaceutical, healthcare and logistics, was the first to be exempted from the lockdown, has hardly resumed full-fledged operations.

Technically, over 30 per cent of India's $2.7 trillion economy was allowed to function from April 20 onwards after the government included more activities in the exempted list, including manufacturing in non-municipal areas and access control areas like SEZs, EOUs and industrial townships, apart from IT and IT enabled services and real estate. However, despite three dozen directives from the home ministry for smooth running of essential services since the lockdown was announced on March 24, the problem persists. ""Several companies have reported difficulties in getting labour. Local administrations should be advised to facilitate availability of labour in factories, warehouses and transportation and distribution operations,"" notes Consumer Affairs Secretary Agarwal.

The root causes of most problems are restrictions on movement of people, and their unwillingness to do work that involves moving across the country, both because of genuine health concerns. Shortage of truck drivers, farm labourers and warehouse workers is resulting in disruption of supply chains, non-availability of raw materials and less production. ""Health is a state subject. So, whatever be the intent and content of the central directives, one cannot stop state governments from asking truck drivers who travel inter-state to quarantine themselves for 14 days after they return. You cannot stop workers returning home from factories in nearby states from being asked to isolate themselves for weeks. The result is that drivers are not willing to go inter-state and workers are unwilling to go to factories,"" says a representative of a food company. . As it is, healthcare workers are getting ostracised in their residential colonies, some even manhandled, making working even in health facilities like hospitals risky, impacting the performance of the sector. Fear rules.

Ill Health

Nipun Jain, partner of Pharmchem, a small scale pharmaceutical company that makes antibiotics such as erythromycin and clarithromycin in Bahadurgarh, Haryana, has gone slow on production despite operational freedom to the pharmaceutical sector. He has a pass that allows him to cross the Delhi-Haryana border to go to his factory from Delhi. But this cannot help him get the required raw material at a competitive price and export finished goods. First, prices of key raw materials, imported from China, have increased. ""Erythromycin has gone up from less than $100 a kilo to $130 a kilo. Clarithromycin is costing $170 a kilo, up from $130 a kilo in the pre-lockdown period,"" says Jain. Even if he is willing to pay, he cannot buy the quantity he requires, as truck operators are refusing to carry less than full load. ""Earlier, booking offices of transport firms used to consolidate 10 small orders and fill the truck. Now, their offices are closed. If I have to buy some material from Mumbai, say 500 kilos, no one will deliver it. The truck owners say they have less drivers and trucks, hence can only take orders for full load (at least nine tonnes). If I have less than that, what do I do?,"" he asks. Jain has also decided against exporting as cargo flights are charging exorbitant rates. ""Unless they offer the same price as before the lockdown, we will be left with no margin. If you are charging us three times more, how will we send our goods? I am waiting for the freight rate to become normal.""

The bigger pharmaceutical companies in India are slightly better off than the smaller ones. Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), says the industry has managed to sustain production amid all challenges. The alliance is a group of 24 leading Indian pharmaceutical companies that account for over 80 per cent of the country's exports of drugs and pharmaceuticals and 57 per cent of the domestic market. ""At this moment, 55-56 per cent production is happening, which is big, as inter-state movement is not all that smooth in (manufacturing hubs like) Baddi (Himachal Pradesh) and Daman (Union Territory). There are other centres where production has gone up to 70- 80 per cent,"" says Jain. He says Indian export-oriented units are also running well in Hyderabad and Vizag. ""Mumbai has a problem of employees. But still, we are improving, and hopefully we should be better soon,"" he says. IPA's Jain also says that no shortage of medicines has been reported, both from within the country and from global customers. ""We have good inventory, and though there is a slight delay in delivery, we are better than many other markets. The credit goes to the good coordination between the government and the industry as the government has been coming out with notifications making sure that the production happens."" The IPA functionary, however, says that the smaller and ancillary companies are facing issues like shortage of liquidity and people. ""Wherever possible, we are working with them.""

However, in the hospital sector, even the big corporate hospitals are pleading for government help. Gurgaon-based Paras Healthcare manages seven hospitals in four states. Its hospital bed occupancy rate has shrunk to 25 per cent. The outpatient department is also getting fewer patients. ""We are going to incur humongous losses. Despite that we have transformed our Ranchi (Jharkhand) facility into a COVID hospital,"" says Dr. Dharminder Nagar, Managing Director, Paras. The disease outbreak and the subsequent lockdown have kept people away from hospitals for small ailments and non-critical surgical procedures. Hospitals, however, need to maintain staff and infrastructure as they may be roped in by governments to contain coronavirus. As part of the National Healthcare Committee of industry chamber CII, Nagar estimates about Rs 7,300 crore monthly loss to the Indian private healthcare sector for at least three months in a row since March. ""Even larger players like us can, maybe, survive for a month or two, but a longer period will be challenging even for us,"" he says. In a letter to the central government, the United Nurses Association of India, a body that represents over five lakh nurses in the country, has alleged that small nursing homes are trimming operations or shutting down and asking staff to leave or work for less pay.

Broken Supply Chain

The logistics industry cuts across sectors. Realising its critical role, the government had allowed inter-state movement of trucks carrying goods, both essential and non-essential, in the initial days of the lockdown itself. However, ground realities are different. ""Movement of trucks is only 5-10 per cent,"" says Vineet Agarwal, Managing Director of Transport Corporation of India Ltd. ""We still have 800-1,000 trucks on the road which had not reached their destinations pre-lockdown. There could be some movement in and out of big cities but inter-state movements are negligible,"" says Agarwal, adding that the drivers are afraid of moving. ""If he goes to a manufacturing zone, he has to unload the truck, but there is no labour. Even if he is able to do that, he is not sure where he will get the next load from, or where he will get his food from. Some more manufacturing will happen (after the April 20 relaxation) but it will take at least three weeks for things to get back to a semblance of normalcy once the lockdown is completely over,"" he adds.

The silver lining is rail container movement. Since loading and unloading happens locally, and goods are essentially foodgrains and pulses for COVID-19 relief supplies, it is operating at 50 per cent. But that can hardly replace the millions of trucks that are off the road at the moment.

The April 20 relaxation has definitely allowed several core manufacturers to restart plants. But business is not just about manufacturing. ""We are going supplier by supplier to see what their constraints are. A car is a sum total of thousands of parts and we have over 75 suppliers over the country. A significant number is in Pune and nearby industrial area which, as you know, is a hotspot. So, we have to see if factories there are allowed to reopen, because even if one part is not being supplied to us, it doesn't matter if all other factories can operate. It is only after we restart operations and things stabilise in the next two-three months that we will need to look at the problem on the demand side,"" says Rajeev Chaba, President and Managing Director of MG Motor. Unlike other automobile makers, MG is sitting on a backlog of 15,500 bookings for its SUV Hector alone.

Of all the segments that have been allowed to function, IT and IT enabled services, major earners of foreign exchange revenues, are the most promising. The government has allowed up to 50 per cent of their employees to work from offices. However, it may take some time before companies would want their employees - who are primarily working from home at the moment - to return to offices. ""Ninety three per cent of our employees are approved to work from home by our customers and 90 per cent are engaged in delivering projects and services globally to our customers in a work from home mode,"" says Abidali Neemuchwala, CEO and MD of Wipro Ltd, giving a clear indication of the priorities of the IT industry. The business uncertainty despite permission to work and ability to manage much of their business remotely is clearly visible among India's IT majors. Infosys CEO Salil Parekh says: ""Given the uncertain environment due to the global pandemic and client businesses marred by volatility, we do not feel it would be appropriate for us to provide an annual guidance at this stage."" While Congnizant has withdrawn its full-year guidance for 2020, Wipro has skipped revenue guidance for the first quarter of the current financial year.

One roadblock to resuming full-fledged operations is the frequent changes in government directives. A day after e-commerce companies like Amazon announced that they will start delivering non-essential goods (read mobile phones, accessories and other electronic devices for personal use), the government reversed its stand by stating that only essential commodities will be allowed. E-tail of essential goods is exempt but, here too, delivery is a major problem. Any person attempting to order groceries from Bigbasket.com during the lockdown will not miss the scroll that moves at the top. ""Dear customer, slots may not be available currently. We are working hard to ensure customers find slots."" In a recent tweet, Albinder Dhindsa, co-founder, Grofers, said the online grocer, with a huge backlog of pending orders, is looking for more manpower. ""If your company has idling semi-skilled workforce that can do with more income and work in a safe environment, please reach out to @Grofers. We are hiring in our warehouses to increase throughout in all cities,"" he tweeted. In fact, a report by LocalCircles, a community social media platform, suggests that the percentage of consumers who were able to find essentials on e-commerce platforms was less than half, 41 per cent, on March 30, though marginally up from 39 per cent on March 25.

The second issue is the very nature of the disease outbreak. Today's hotspot (an area where you have COVID-19 patients) may tomorrow be a green zone (where you dont have positive patients), and vice versa. In other words, no company can restart operations thinking it can continue from that moment onwards. The movement may be restricted any time. It's the virus that takes the call.

Rajesh Srivastava, MD, Rabo Equity Advisors, has a suggestion that is perhaps sound during these uncertain times. And it is not linked to the partial, conditional and reversible freedom the government offers to companies today. ""Let's assume things (the viral outbreak) get back to normalcy from July onwards, and then it will take two more quarters for businesses to normalise. In other words, you start rebooting your business from the second quarter of FY21, and start normal business operations from January 1, 2021,"" he says. Srivastava, a veteran in food processing business advisory, is talking about the sector that he knows well. But it could very well be an analogy that works for many other sectors too.

Srivastava has some good news, at least for the food processing business. ""The silver lining is that when it opens up, there will be pent-up demand as today, the demand is not extinguished, it's only suppressed. I expect a demand explosion for secondary processed food, the ready to eat, ready to cook, frozen food. My guess is growth will be huge,"" he adds.

Its hope alone that will drive businesses and consumers, at least for now.

https://www.financialexpress.com/investing-abroad/stockal-specials/say-yes-to-investing-in-the-market-and-no-to-the-timing/1952364/,"Today let us discuss importance of staying invested in market at all times.

Human psychology often causes us to be overly bullish or bearish depending on the overall market’s existing trend. As a result, when the prevailing sentiment is optimistic in nature, investors tend to plough in more money into the market and tend to pull out money, often as a fire-sale, when sentiment turns pessimistic.

We believe that timing the market is extremely difficult for even the savviest of investors and almost next to impossible.

We believe that in absence of a crystal ball, the best alternative to improve returns is to continue to stay invested in the markets at all times.

To support this hypothesis, we analysed the impact of moving out funds off the market for a range of time periods. To illustrate, we used S&P 500 data starting from 01-Jan-2000 to 31-Dec-2019.

Investing in the S&P 500 is often done through SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). This exchange traded fund (ETF) is one of the most preferred options to mimic exposure to the S&P 500 market index.

The below chart shows the performance of SPY starting from 2000 till the start of this year.

The SPY has seen multiple swings over the past 20 years and despite various bouts of volatility and downturns, has delivered good returns to investors. Notable events include the impact of dotcom bust during the 2000s and the financial collapse of 2008. The below chart shows the daily returns of the SPY.

As observed, daily returns of the SPY have varied a lot. There have been periods of calm where the swings in daily returns have been small and during times of market volatility, the swings have been extremely huge. Particularly huge swings were observed in 2008 to 2010 as the markets recovered from the financial crisis.

Now, let’s look at the performance on the overall returns to an investor who was off the market due to a reactionary response to the overall market trend.

As evident from the table above, an investor participating in the markets at all times would have realized a healthy annualized return of 6.24% (in dollars terms… i.e. without considering appreciation of the USD against INR!).

Contrast that with an investor who missed the ten best days of the market may have realized a measly return of 2.45%. Investors who miss days would actually lose money!

So, Say YES to investing in the market… Say NO to timing!

Stay Invested! Stay Safe!","human psychology often causes us to be overly bullish or bearish depending on the overall market’s existing trend. when the prevailing sentiment is optimistic, investors tend to plough in more money into the market and tend to pull out money, often as a fire-sale, when sentiment turns pessimistic. to support this hypothesis, we analysed the impact of moving out funds off the market for a range of time periods.",Negative

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin felt it necessary to personally call the heads of the six largest U.S. banks to calm nerves and made plans to convene a group of officials known as the “Plunge Protection Team.”

“It provides more than enough fodder for perceptions of chaos and instability in the White House,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB.

“At the same time, the government shutdown offers a true foretaste of what lies ahead once the new Congress in sworn in on January 3.”

GLOBAL SLOWDOWN

The political uncertainty has only added to the air of risk aversion, punishing equities to the benefit of bonds.

The Nasdaq has fallen nearly 22 percent from its Aug. 29 high and into bear territory, while the S&P 500 was on track for its worst December since the Great Depression.

At the same time 10-year Treasury yields were near their lowest since August at 2.79 percent, having fallen over 40 basis points in just six weeks.

The gap between two- and 10-year yields has shrunk to only 14 basis points, a flattening of the curve that has sometimes heralded economic turning points in the past.

“Many of the financial and economic indicators that turn first around business cycle peaks are now flashing red in advanced economies,” warned Simon MacAdam, global economist as Capital Economics.

“This is consistent with our view that the recent loss of momentum in the world economy will develop into a more severe slowdown in 2019.”

The flight to safe havens was again boosting the Japanese yen, with the dollar near a three-month trough at 111.02 yen on Monday.

It fared better on the euro, which was undermined by a run of poor data out of Europe. The single currency hovered at $1.1376, after being as high as $1.1485 last week.

Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was a shade softer at 96.835.

In commodity markets, gold held near its recent six-month peak as the dollar eased and the threat of higher U.S. interest rates waned. Spot gold stood at $1,261.05 per ounce.

Oil prices were near their lowest since the third quarter of 2017, having shed no less than 11 percent last week.

In its annual edition of Notorious Markets List for counterfeiting and piracy, the USTR said on Wednesday that Snapdeal is known as a place to purchase counterfeit watches and shoes.

According to a November 2018 survey, 37 per cent of its customers reported that they had received a counterfeit product from Snapdeal, the USTR said.

Responding to the USTR’s move, a Snapdeal spokesperson said: “The comments made in the report in respect of Snapdeal are factually incorrect in most aspects, are based on unverified inputs and are defamatory in nature.

“The comments made in the report in respect of Snapdeal are factually incorrect in most aspects, are based on unverified inputs and are defamatory in nature,” the spokesperson said.

Snapdeal along with four Indian shopping complexes have figured in the US’ 2020 edition of the Notorious Markets List. Other than Snapdeal, the four markets are Tank Road in Delhi, Heera Panna in Mumbai, Kidderpore in Kolkata and Millennium Centre in Aizawl. “In July 2019, Snapdeal’s founders were arrested for selling counterfeit products,” the USTR claimed. Right holders have also sued Snapdeal for selling counterfeit goods,” said the report.

In a statement, the spokesperson of the online marketplace said that the company firmly disagrees with the findings of the report and specifically in its observations relating to Snapdeal. The report also ignores the extensive and on-going efforts by various marketplaces to collaborate with brands towards the protection of intellectual property on online marketplaces, said the spokesperson.

As India’s third-largest marketplace, Snapdeal operates a robust anti-counterfeit programme – Brand Shield – that enables easy reporting and takedown of listings of counterfeits and delisting of defaulting sellers, it asserted, adding that it has well-defined measures to verify the identity of sellers based on government registrations.

Snapdeal works closely with global and leading Indian brands and with law enforcement authorities to provide information wherever required to support any effort to enforce the legal rights of the brand owners, the spokesperson said.

According to the spokesperson, Snapdeal is also an active member of the International Trademark Association, a global alliance spanning 7200 members across 187 countries, including large brand owners, small and medium enterprises, government offices, non-profits, among others.

In all, the US Trade Representatives’ (USTR) annual list has 38 online markets and 34 physical markets that are reported to engage in or facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. The report released by USTR seeks to cast aspersions on many of the world’s leading online marketplaces, including Amazon, Pinduoduo, Shopee, Snapdeal, Taobao, Tokopedia and many more, the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson claimed that the USTR report is based on a limited understanding of the business models of online marketplaces and ignores the roles and responsibilities of intermediaries under the law in various jurisdictions with respect to each of the models. Further, the process of collating such inputs by the office of the USTR is neither objective nor inclusive, the spokesperson said.",Snapdeal has been placed in the notorious markets list for counterfeiting and piracy. the online marketplace has been ranked in the us' 2020 edition. the report is based on 'unverified inputs' and is 'defamatory' in nature. the company has firmly disagreed with the findings of the report. the report also ignores efforts by various marketplaces to collaborate with brands towards the protection of intellectual property on online marketplaces.,Negative

Sharing his market outlook going ahead, the market expert said that cheap construction and industries are most likely to lead the upward surge in the market going ahead.","the ongoing global trade war between US and China has injected fears in the stock markets and investors alike in the past few weeks. veteran market investors Sandip Sabharwal believes that the trade war fears will soon wane away, bringing back normalcy to the markets. cheap construction and industries are most likely to lead the upward surge in the market going ahead, he said.",Negative
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/poll-americans-are-the-unhappiest-theyve-been-in-50-years-5413761.html,"It's been a rough year for the American psyche. Folks in the U.S. are more unhappy today than they've been in nearly 50 years.

This bold — yet unsurprising — conclusion comes from the COVID Response Tracking Study, conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. It finds that just 14% of American adults say they're very happy, down from 31% who said the same in 2018. That year, 23% said they'd often or sometimes felt isolated in recent weeks. Now, 50% say that.

The survey, conducted in late May, draws on nearly a half-century of research from the General Social Survey, which has collected data on American attitudes and behaviors at least every other year since 1972. No less than 29% of Americans have ever called themselves very happy in that survey.

Most of the new survey’s interviews were completed before the death of George Floyd touched off nationwide protests and a global conversation about race and police brutality, adding to the feelings of stress and loneliness Americans were already facing from the coronavirus outbreak — especially for black Americans.

Lexi Walker, a 47-year-old professional fiduciary who lives near Greenville, South Carolina, has felt anxious and depressed for long stretches of this year. She moved back to South Carolina late in 2019, then her cat died. Her father passed away in February. Just when she thought she’d get out and socialize in an attempt to heal from her grief, the pandemic hit.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

“It’s been one thing after another,” Walker said. “This is very hard. The worst thing about this for me, after so much, I don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Among other finding from the new poll about life in the pandemic:

— The public is less optimistic today about the standard of living improving for the next generation than it has been in the past 25 years. Only 42% of Americans believe that when their children reach their age, their standard of living will be better. A solid 57% said that in 2018. Since the question was asked in 1994, the previous low was 45% in 1994.

— Compared with surveys conducted after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 and after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Americans are less likely to report some types of emotional and psychological stress reactions following the COVID-19 outbreak. Fewer report smoking more than usual, crying or feeling dazed now than after those two previous tragedies, though more report having lost their temper or wanting to get drunk.

— About twice as many Americans report being lonely today as in 2018, and not surprisingly given the lockdowns that tried to contain the spread of the coronavirus, there’s also been a drop in satisfaction with social activities and relationships. Compared with 2018, Americans also are about twice as likely to say they sometimes or often have felt a lack of companionship (45% vs. 27%) and felt left out (37% vs. 18%) in the past four weeks.

What is surprising, said Louise Hawkley, a senior research scientist with NORC at the University of Chicago, was that loneliness was not even more prevalent.

“It isn’t as high as it could be,"" she said. “People have figured out a way to connect with others. It’s not satisfactory, but people are managing to some extent.”

The new poll found that there haven't been significant changes in Americans’ assessment of their families' finances since 2018 and that Americans' satisfaction with their families’ ability to get along financially was as high as it's been over nearly five decades.

Jonathan Berney, of Austin, Texas, said that the pandemic — and his resulting layoff as a digital marketing manager for a law firm — caused him to reevaluate everything in his life. While he admits that he’s not exactly happy now, that’s led to another uncomfortable question: Was he truly happy before the pandemic?

“2020 just fast forwarded a spiritual decay. When things are good, you don’t tend to look inwards,” he said, adding that he was living and working in the Miami area before the pandemic hit. As Florida dealt with the virus, his girlfriend left him and he decided to leave for Austin. “I probably just wasn’t a nice guy to be around from all the stress and anxiety. But this forced an existential crisis.”

Berney, who is looking for work, said things have improved from those early, dark days of the pandemic. He’s still job hunting but has a little savings to live on. He said he's trying to kayak more and center himself so he’s better prepared to deal with any future downturn in events.

Reimagining happiness is almost hard-wired into Americans’ DNA, said Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside.

“Human beings are remarkably resilient. There’s lots and lots of evidence that we adapt to everything. We move forward,” she said, adding that she’s done happiness studies since the pandemic started and found that some people are slightly happier than last year.

Melinda Hartline, of Tampa, who was laid off from her job in public relations in March, said she was in a depressed daze those first few weeks of unemployment. Then she started to bike and play tennis and enrolled in a college course on post-crisis leadership.

Today, she’s worried about the state of the world and the economy, and she wonders when she can see her kids and grandkids who live on the West Coast — but she also realizes that things could be a lot worse.

“Anything can happen. And you have to be prepared,” she said. “Whether it’s your health, your finances, whether it’s the world. You have to be prepared. And always maintain that positive mental attitude. It’s going to get you through it.”","just 14% of american adults say they're very happy, down from 31% who said the same in 2018. that year, 23% said they'd often or sometimes felt isolated in recent weeks. now, 50% say that. a vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. a vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic.",Negative

Lifeless hotels. A stunning emptiness - and fears of economic ruin - haunt the usually bustling city of Mecca after Saudi authorities curtailed the hajj pilgrimage over coronavirus Islam's holiest city usually hosts millions of pilgrims for the annual rite, but the kingdom has barred overseas visitors from this year's event, scheduled for late July. The hajj and the lesser umrah pilgrimage together rake in some $12 billion, keeping the economy humming in Mecca, home to two million people and marble-bedecked skyscrapers towering over Islam's most sacred sites.A construction boom in recent years has added shopping malls, apartments and luxury hotels, some offering spectacular views of the sacred Kaaba, a cube-shaped structure in the Grand Mosque towards which Muslims around the world pray.But most premises have lain empty since the pandemic reached the kingdom. The virus, which hit Mecca hard, has also battered pilgrimage-reliant businesses that support hundreds of thousands of jobs, from travel agents to street barbers and souvenir shops.Many have reported sweeping layoffs, pay cuts or delayed salaries. ""Zero sales, zero income,"" said Ahmed Attia, a 39-year-old Egyptian who works for a travel agency in the city.""We're not used to seeing Mecca empty. It feels like a dead city. It's devastating for Mecca."" 'Photo-op' - A tsunami of cancellations has also battered overseas hajj operators who organise travel logistics for pilgrims, many of whom invest their life savings in the five-day ritual.Saudi authorities had already in March suspended the umrah pilgrimage, which can be performed at any time. Then, in a hugely sensitive but long-awaited decision, they said they would only allow around 1,000 pilgrims already present in the kingdom to perform the hajj.That is a tiny fraction of the 2.5 million pilgrims who attended last year. ""It will be a symbolic event, a photo-op that allows the kingdom to say 'we didn't cancel the hajj as many expected',"" said a South Asian official in contact with hajj authorities. Saudi Arabia has stressed that the watered-down hajj will be open to people of various nationalities. But the selection process for the few spots is expected to be hotly contested, as some Mecca residents expect to be given priority over outsiders.""I have gone to hajj before and hopefully this year, with God's will, I will be among the first pilgrims,"" said Marwan Abdulrahman, a Saudi living in Mecca. Many feared the pilgrimage, which packs colossal crowds into small religious sites, could have been a massive source of contagion.The novel coronavirus has hit the kingdom with the highest number of cases in the Gulf -- more than 178,000 confirmed infections including 1,511 deaths. But scaling the pilgrimage back will deepen the kingdom's economic slump, analysts say.The move follows a sharp downturn in oil prices and coronavirus-led losses, which triggered austerity measures including the tripling of a value added tax and cuts to civil servants' allowances. The hajj decision ""does compound Saudi Arabia's economic difficulties"", Richard Robinson, a Middle East analyst at Oxford Analytica, told AFP.On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund warned the kingdom's GDP will shrink by 6.8 percent this year -- its worst performance since the 1980s oil glut. Salary delays - The Saudi Binladen construction group, a bellwether known for vast mega-projects, has missed salary payments for thousands of workers in recent months, according to a source close to the company and employees complaining on social media.The Arabic hashtag ""Delays in Binladen salaries"" has gained traction as the slowdown impacts the firm behind a series of critical projects, including a $15 billion skyscraper hotel complex that towers over Mecca's Grand Mosque. The company is seeking to charter a number of private jets to send many of its laid-off South Asian labourers home, according to the source.The company did not respond to a request for comment. The downturn has also disrupted Riyadh's ambitious plans to build a tourism industry from scratch, a cornerstone of the Vision 2030 reform programme to reduce the kingdom's reliance on oil.""The government has singled out tourism as a key area for growth under its diversification strategy, and the loss of hajj revenues could set the sector back through lost investment or bankruptcies,"" said Robinson. The kingdom began offering tourist visas for the first time last September in moves to open up one of the last frontiers of global tourism.""While Saudis are looking to diversify tourism revenues beyond religious tourism, their efforts still build from the hajj,"" said Kristin Diwan of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. ""Not having it at this time of disruption in oil markets is a blow.""","the hajj and lesser umrah pilgrimage together rake in some $12 billion. the kingdom has barred overseas visitors from this year's event, scheduled for late July. the virus, which hit the holy city hard, has also battered pilgrimage-reliant businesses. many have reported sweeping layoffs, pay cuts or delayed salaries.",Negative

Still, while experts say actual coronavirus cases are likely higher than current reports, the trajectory falls far short of the Spanish flu, which began in 1918 and infected an estimated 500 million people.

Deaths related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, stood at 245,992. The first death was reported on January 10 in Wuhan, China, after the virus emerged there in December.

The daily rate of new cases worldwide has been sitting in a 2-3 percent range over the past week, versus a peak of around 13 percent in mid-March, prompting many countries to begin easing lockdown measures that have upended businesses and crippled the global economy.

The loosening of restrictions has proved controversial, as experts debate the best strategy to ensure there is no large ""second wave"" outbreak.

Health officials have also expressed concern about the rising case numbers in countries where there is a shortage of testing and a lack of medical facilities.

While the number of new cases has come off a peak of 104,495 reported in a single day last week, it is still at around 80,000 to 90,000 cases per day globally.

LIFTING LOCKDOWN?

In the United States, around half the country's state governors partially reopened their economies over the weekend, while others, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, declared the move was premature.

In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who battled COVID-19 last month, said on Sunday the country was over the peak but it was still too early to relax lockdown measures.

Even in countries where the suppression of the disease has been considered successful, such as Australia and New Zealand which have recorded daily rates of new infections in the low single digits for weeks, officials have been cautious.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has predicated a full lifting of curbs on widespread public adoption of a mobile phone tracing app and increased testing levels.

Experts caution that both cases and deaths from COVID-19 are almost certainly underreported. Cases may cause only mild symptoms and not everyone with symptoms is tested, while most countries only record hospital deaths, meaning deaths in private homes and nursing homes have not yet been included.

https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/gdp-report-to-show-a-damaged-economy-sliding-into-recession/1942887/,"The US economy began 2020 riding the crest of a record-long expansion with every expectation that its 11th year of growth would not be its last. Then the economy screeched to a sudden halt. And now it’s in free-fall. On Wednesday, the government will offer a glimpse of how dark the picture has grown and how much worse it could get as the coronavirus pandemic inflicts ruinous damage. The Commerce Department is expected to estimate that the gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of the economy, shrank at an annual rate of 5% or more in the January-March quarter.

That would be the sharpest quarterly drop in GDP since the Great Recession, which ended in 2009. And it would be the first quarterly contraction in six years. And yet forecasters say that will be only a precursor of a far grimmer GDP report to come for the current April-June quarter, when business shutdowns and layoffs have struck with devastating force.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that GDP will plunge in the current quarter by a 40% annual rate. That would be, by a breathtaking margin, the bleakest quarter since such records were first compiled in 1947. In just a few weeks, businesses across the country have shut down and laid off tens of millions of workers. Factories and stores are shuttered. Home sales are falling. Households are slashing spending. Consumer confidence is sinking.

As the economy slides into what looks like a severe recession, some economists are holding out hope that a recovery will arrive quickly and robustly once the health crisis has been solved what some call a V-shaped recovery. Increasingly, though, analysts say they think the economy will struggle to regain its momentum even after the viral outbreak has subsided.

Many Americans, they suggest, could remain too fearful to travel, shop at stores or visit restaurants or movie theaters anywhere near as much as they used to. In addition, local and state officials may continue to limit, for health reasons, how many people may congregate in such places at any one time, thereby making it difficult for many businesses to survive. It’s why some economists say the damage from the downturn could persist far longer than some may assume.

The recession will be worse than the one we went through from 2007 to 2009, said Sung Won Sohn, economics and business professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, referring to the downturn that came to be called the Great Recession because it was the worst slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

There is also fear that the coronavirus could flare up again after the economy is re-opened, forcing reopened businesses to shut down again. The virus has done a lot of damage to the economy, and there is just so much uncertainty now, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.

Zandi said he thought the economy could resume its growth in the July-September quarter before faltering in the final quarter of 2020 and then regaining its footing on a sustained basis in mid-2021 assuming that a coronavirus vaccine is ready for use by then.

I would characterize this period as going through quicksand until we get a vaccine, Zandi said.The Trump administration takes a rosier view. President Donald Trump told reporters this week that he expects a big rise in GDP in the third quarter, followed by an incredible fourth quarter, and you’re going to have an incredible next year.

The president is predicating his re-election campaign on the argument that he built a powerful economy over the past three years and can do so again after the health crisis has been resolved.","the economy is in free-fall, but some economists are holding out hope that a recovery will arrive quickly and robustly. some economists say they think the economy will struggle to regain momentum even after the virus outbreak has subsided. the cbo has estimated that GDP will plunge in the current quarter by a 40% annual rate. the recession will be worse than the one we went through from 2007 to 2009, said a spokesman for the cbo.",Negative
https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/coronavirus-impact-time-for-employers-to-up-skill-employees/story/404871.html,"Coronavirus lockdown has left informal workers high and dry without daily wages. CMIE data shows that of the 12.2 crore people who lost jobs in April, 75 per cent were small traders and daily wage labourers. This reminds one of Charles Dickens' literary masterpiece Hard Times where he referred to factory workers not as individuals but 'Hands', reducing people to their value producing part. The government recently announced that it is working on an action plan to upskill and reskill workers once the lockdown is lifted. The rationale is to enable them to be gainfully employed and restart economic activity.

But, one of the problems is 90% of India's workforce is employed in the informal sector where no efforts are made for skilling. ""When firms get work from informal workers, they remain as hired hands, as mazdoor and no effort is made for their skilling and training,"" says Ravi Venkatesan, Founder of coalition Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME). Carpenters, electricians will continue to do shoddy work which means they have no alternative to increase income or the option of improving their lives.

For the quantum growth of the economy, investments in education and skilling of informal workers are key, especially because a huge share of population has very little skills. The government has spent a lot of money in skilling but it hasn't had much impact. ""We need to think of ways to increase the skill set of those who are working in the informal sector right now as most of these workers do not have the luxury of time or any buffer savings to get skilled,"" says Partha Chatterjee, Professor and Head of the Economics Department at Shiv Nadar University. This is important to avoid the distress of labour in the COVID-like situation again in the future.

For this, he suggests, the employers have to be involved. Right now, employers do not spend anything on skilling their employees. That needs to change. ""We need to think how we can incentivise the employers to upskill employees. We also have to bring the skilling programs to the workers than the workers going to skilling centers.""

PriyaNaik, Founder and CEO, Samhita Social Ventures says that employers in sectors like apparel, textiles, hospitality, and tourism should imagine ways to up-skill and re-skill workers to enable them to be absorbed by other sectors in which there are better and more opportunities to earn.

Take the case of Gujarat based textile manufacturer Arvind Ltd. that has been using the approach of ""planned attrition"". Punit Lalbhai, Executive Director of Arvind in a webinar ""Protecting Human Capital to emerge from crisis"" said the firm takes responsibility to ""upgrade the skills of those who work with us into planned outplacement into industries that have better potential to augment income"". He added, employers need to think about how to ""re-calibrate, retrain, and redeploy parts of the workforce in a way that's not only ensuring that short term needs are met, but also in a way that prepares a skillset for Future India.""

https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/banks/indian-economy-who-needs-corporates-to-run-banks-and-how-will-it-help-indian-economy/story/423707.html,"A series of economic ""reforms"" have been unleashed since 2016 that defy economic logic - from the demonetisation of 2016 to the AatmaNirbhar Bharat of 2020. The latest one on the block is to let big corporate/industrial houses run banks. Interestingly, this is the only ""reform"" which hasn't dropped out of the blue at nightly live-telecasts; it is a mere proposal at present, but with far reaching consequences if pursued.

This proposal comes from the RBI's internal working group (IWG) report released on November 20, 2020 stating: ""large corporate/industrial houses may be allowed as promoters of banks"" and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs or shadow banks) owned by corporate houses ""may be considered for conversion into banks"".

It does not explain why it desires so, except making a general case for improving credit flows to make India a $5 trillion economy but without considering why India and developed economies like the US have studiously avoided such a course for decades.

Why economists opposing big industries running banks?

All of India's top economists with wide national and international exposures strongly oppose this reform proposal.

Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and former Deputy Governor Viral Acharya, who should know better about banking, wrote an article ""Do we really need Indian corporations in banking?"" describing it as a ""bombshell"" and ""best left on the shelf"".

They offered two arguments against it: (i) industrial houses will get finances from banks they run with no questions asked (even though not their own money but public deposits), that the history of such banks (connected or related-party lending) ""is invariably disastrous"" and (ii) it will ""exacerbate"" concentration of economic and political power, making India susceptible to ""authoritarian cronyism"".

They flagged a third point though didn't list it: (iii) banks are rarely allowed to fail in India, as in the recent cases of Yes Bank and Lakshmi Vilas Bank, in which case public depositors and taxpayers will bear the burden of bailouts, NPA write-offs and remonetisation as and when these banks fail.

Seen from this perspective, the IWG's proposal is a win-win-win proposition for big businesses but lose-lose-lose for public depositors and taxpayers (loss of deposits, opportunity cost of not investing in better projects and cost of bail-out/remonetisation).

Two former chief economic advisers of India (CEAs) and a former finance secretary of India, Arvind Subramanian, Shankar Acharya and Vijay Kelkar, also opposed it.

They wrote (""A capital mistake"") with a dire warning: ""The conclusion is clear. Mixing industry and finance will set us on a road full of dangers - for growth, public finances and the future of the country itself. We sincerely urge policymakers not to take this path.""

They listed three reasons: (a) over-finance of risky activities (due to connected-lending or related- party transactions banned by multiple Indian laws) (b) encourage inefficiency by delaying exit and (c) entrench their dominance.

Also Read: Rebooting Economy 47: Do India's fiscal numbers suggest a quick turn-around?

Another former CEA and former World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu warned that it is ""almost invariably a step towards crony capitalism, where a few big corporations capture the business space in the country, slowly edging out the smaller players"".

He pointed out: ""There is a lot of evidence that connected lending was the biggest cause of the build-up of bad loans in 1997 in Asia, which resulted in the East Asian Crisis that began in Thailand and turned out to be one of the biggest financial crashes in the world.""

Why now when banking system is in deep crisis?

Rajan and Acharya raised this question and offered two reasons.

Firstly, they wrote, ""the government wants to expand the set of bidders when it finally turns to privatising some of our public sector banks"", which they strongly oppose (""Indian Banks: A Time for Reform?"") and secondly, ""an industrial house holding a payment bank license wants to transform into bank"" since one of the IWG recommendations is to shorten the time for such transformation from five to three years.

The first answer gives a clue to an equally big banking reform waiting in the wings: handing over ownership of public sector banks to private corporates/industrial houses. Indeed, the government has disclosed that it intends to give up ownership of more than half of public sector banks (PSBs).

That the banking system has been in severe crisis for several years is not unknown.

A number of banks and NBFCs have collapsed and/or are facing serious charges of financial mismanagement involving many corporate bigwigs of India since 2018: PMC Bank, Punjab National Bank, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, IL&FS, HDIL, DHFL (last three being NBFCs) etc.

The crisis is mainly due to loan defaults (NPAs) by corporate entities and poor corporate governance that allow undue favours, diversion of loans to projects not meant for and money laundering. Some of the big corporate leaders like Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Jatin Mehta (Winsome Diamonds) and Sandesara brothers (Sterling Biotech) are accused of misdeeds and have fled the country without paying their debts.

The Credit Suisse's ""India Corporate Health Tracker"" of August 2019 showed that barring a few exceptions, all big private business houses are heavily indebted and ""chronically stressed"". It warned that another wave of NPA crisis is coming. (For more read "" Rebooting Economy XIII: Why Indian corporates are debt-ridden "")

That was before the pandemic hit.

The pandemic brought moratorium on loan repayment, which big businesses lapped up even when capable of repaying. The RBI's half-yearly Financial Stability Report (FSR) of July 2020 said 70% of the moratorium offer was availed by corporates rated 'A' and above with comfortable debt-equity ratio (meaning they could pay but chose not to).

This RBI report warned that the Gross NPA ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) was likely to worsen from 8.5% in March 2020 to 12.5-14.7% in March 2021 due to the pandemic-induced economic distress.

The IWG's main argument for allowing big corporates/industrial houses to run banks is that India's credit-to-GDP ratio is very low, just about 50% in 2019, while that of the US, Japan, China and South Korea was more than 150%.

At 50% of credit-to-GDP, the Indian banking system has slipped into deep financial distress. What would happen when the lending goes up to 100% or 150% that the RBI's IWG seeks?

Also Read: Rebooting Economy 46: Who is designing India's growth path?

Also, who will take additional liquidity to be generated?

Certainly not large industries as the RBI data reveal they have had very poor credit growth in the past few years. In FY20, the credit growth to large industries plunged to 0.6% and to industry as a whole (small, medium and large) a meagre 0.7%.

In case the IWG and RBI are constrained for funds, here is an efficient and abundant source of it.

India has a very vibrant and booming capital/stock market with more than enough liquidity the RBI can tap any time. Even as the Indian economy has slipped into a recession and performed worse than all major economies in the world, its stock markets have touched new highs.

On November 24, 2020, the BSE Sensex touched an all-time high of 44,523 (daily closing) - overtaking by a mile its pre-pandemic high of 42,063 of January 17, 2020. The same day, the Nifty50 crossed its pre-pandemic high of 12,362 recorded on January 14, 2020 by breaking a new record of 13,055 (daily closing).

Who is behind this reform proposal?

Why did the IWG make such a proposal amidst a banking crisis caused by corporate loan defaults, money laundering etc. and recession?

It gives an important clue.

It says: ""All the experts except one were of the opinion that large corporate/industrial houses should not be allowed to promote a bank.""

It spelt out their objections too:

1. Primarily because ""prevailing corporate governance culture in corporate houses is not up to the international standard"";

2. ""It will be difficult to ring fence the non-financial activities of the promoters with that of the bank"" and ""stress in non-financial activity may spill over to the bank;

3. Corporate houses ""may either provide undue credit to their own businesses or may favour lending to their close business associates"";

4. ""May influence lending by the bank, to finance the supply and distribution chains and customers of the group's non-financial businesses"" and

Several questions arise from these: If all the experts it consulted, except one, opposed the proposal, why did IWG go for it? What new evidence has it got to over-turn the RBI's earlier stand (most recently in 2020 and 2016) and negate two Parliamentary Standing Committees of 2013 and 2014 which strongly opposed it? Who is driving the RBI from backrooms?

Also Read: Rebooting Economy 45: What is AatmaNirbhar Bharat and where will it take India?

First, here is some insight that Rajan and Acharya provided in their article.

They wrote that the IWG ""may have had little power over"" this recommendation and explained that this could be the reason for the IWG to suggest ""significant amendments to the Banking Regulation Act of 1949"" before allowing big corporate players to own and run banks. They went on to puncture this fatuous pre-condition by arguing that had legislation been the answer, corporates wouldn't have misused the banking system and the NPA crisis wouldn't have arisen in the first place.

Secondly, a couple of months back in August 2020, national dailies reported that the RBI had shot down the Niti Aayog's proposal to allow big corporates/industrial houses to set up and run banks.

This was not surprising since the central bank had junked such a suggestion in 2016 also while issuing ""Guidelines for 'on tap' Licensing of Universal Banks in Private Sector"". The document categorically stated that ""large industrial houses are excluded as eligible entities"", even while allowing them to invest up to 10% in banks.

This was a change in position for the RBI from its 2013 stand spelt out in the guidelines for banking licenses, which had allowed industrial houses to apply for banking licenses. What made it change its stance?

Two Parliamentary Standing Committees, one in 2013 and another in 2014, were scathing in their criticism of the RBI's 2013 move, pointing at facts and evidence to recommend that banking being ""a highly leveraged business involving public money and public welfare"" it will be more in the fitness of things to ""keep industry and banking separate"".

The 2014 committee reminded the RBI and the government that the presence of bank branches in rural areas is very low (17%) and most banks - 6 of 26 private banks and 16 of 26 public sector banks - had failed to comply with 40% priority lending norm.

It concluded: ""The Committee, therefore, reiterate that the Government/RBI should ensure that no recurrence of the pre-nationalization situation happens, when the management of private banks deployed their funds to extend undue favour to their own industrial owners without regard to social priorities determined by Government.""

What did it mean by ""no recurrence of pre-nationalisation situation"" and why did it warn about it?

Forgotten lessons of Bank Nationalisation of 1969

Why banks were nationalised, starting with 1969, is instructive.

Until 1969, Indian banking was entirely in private hands.

The RBI recorded that historical transition from private to public ownership (some private banks were allowed to operate even then) in the first chapter ""The Defining Event"" of Volume III (1967-1981) of its own history - ""RBI History"".

Here it goes.

The report said there were several political, economic and banking compulsions at the time. India faced political uncertainties following the deaths of the first two Prime Ministers, Nehru and Shastri, within a short span of two years. The 1962 war with China and the 1965 war with Pakistan, drought and famines caused immense economic stress: the treasury was empty and a balance of payment crisis hit, delaying the Third Five-year Plan by three years.

As for the banking reasons, it listed three: (a) lack of banking facilities for (i) agriculture (ii) small-scale industrial units and (iii) self-employed (b) bank expansion during 1951-1967 ""un-served"" rural and semi-urban areas as focus was firmly on urban areas and (c) private banks were ""seen as being excessively concerned with profit alone"" and ""unwilling to diversify their loan portfolios"".

Under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the Congress sought to remove such distortions by declaring in its 1967 election manifesto that ""it was necessary to bring most of the 'banking institutions under social control to serve the cause of economic growth more effectively and to make credit available to the producers in all fields where it is needed'"".

The following two graphs have been taken from the RBI's 2008 ""Report on Currency and Finance"" to reflect the ground realities of the time.

The first graph shows the share of credit flows to agriculture was a meagre 2.1% in FY51 and marginally improved to 2.2% in FY67; that to individuals (""personal"") went down from 6.8% in FY51 to 4.2% in FY67. On the other hand, the share of credit to industry was a high 34% in FY51 and grew even higher to 64.3% in FY67.

As on March 27, 2020, the situation was different.

The share of credit flow to agriculture had increased to 12.6%, that for ""personal"" loans to 27.7% and industry's share stood at a healthy 31.5% (large industries accounted for 26.2% of the total) - according to the RBI database.

This is a massive redistribution of credit, particularly to the unbanked population.

The next graph shows distribution of bank branches.

Rural branches were fewer - 13.3% in 1952 (end December), growing to 17.9% in 1967 (end December). Urban/metropolitan branches were 35.7% in 1952, growing to 38.9% in 1967. Semi-urban areas saw its dominance coming down from a high of 47.8% in 1952 to 43.3% in 1967.

At the end of June 2020, the RBI database showed the number of commercial bank branches stood at 33.3% in rural areas, 27.4% in semi-urban and 39.3% in urban/metropolitan areas.

That is a massive improvement too.

How did nationalised banks save India during 2007-08 crash?

The Great Recession of 2007-08 taught a big lesson to all economies: private and largely unregulated banking and other financial institutions (particularly NBFCs) pose a serious systemic risk. Complex, opaque and high-risk financial instruments that private banks, NBFCs and other financial entities brought in to maximise profits derailed the US economy, and the distress travelled across the world.

India emerged relatively unscathed because its banking system is dominated by government-owned banks with less opaque and risky instruments of maximising profits. The US paid a heavy price of bailing out its financial system. It nationalised two big shadow banks (NBFCs) in the housing mortgage markets, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. By then they had run up a combined debt of $5.4 trillion.

Ironically, Fannie Mae was a government-owned entity, set up in 1938 to fight the financial crunch in the wake of the 1929 Great Depression (sparked by private financial entities) and had a highly successful run for 30 years when it was handed over to the private sector in 1968. Freddie Mac was created by the US Congress too, but as a private entity to compete with Fannie Mae. Both put a burden of $5.4 trillion on the US taxpayers when these were nationalised in September 2008. (For more read Rebooting Economy XVI: How governments run shadow banking and risk financial stability)

The US government also bailed out several other private banks and financial institutions, namely Bank of America, Citigroup, AIG, Bear Stearns, at a huge cost to its taxpayers.

India did not have to do it then but it should be prepared before following the same path that led to multiple economic crises all over the world from 1929. Apart from the Great Recession of 2007-08, financial mismanagement by private banks, NBFCs and other financial entities led to the dot.com burst (2000-01), Asian financial crisis (late 1990s), Latin American crisis (1990s-2000s), Japan crisis (1990s-2000s) and many others. (For more read "" Rebooting Economy XII: Is private sector inherently more efficient than public sector? "")

The Great Recession of 2007-08 brought some dramatic changes in banking systems in developed countries. They are now increasing government-ownership (asset share) in banking.

Here is a graph from the World Bank's 2013 report ""Rethinking the Role of the State in Finance"" showing the changes in government-ownership in banking pre- and post-2007-08 financial crisis.

Developed economies have increased government ownership in banks (asset share) but developing ones like India are diluting theirs, which indicates the latter countries are not learning any lesson.

This World Bank report clearly explained why and how government-ownership of banks are critical in ""stabilising aggregate credit"" and played key roles in limiting damages during the financial meltdown of 2007-08 in several countries, including India and China. (For more read "" Rebooting Economy XVII: Why governments promote shadow banking "")

No wonder, many developed countries, including the US, keep banking and other industries separate. The US specifically prohibits big industrial houses with ownership and controlling stakes in non-banking business (manufacturing and others) from owning or controlling banks.

India will do itself great harm by diluting government-ownership that saved it from the 2007-08 global financial meltdown.

Will ""bail-in"" reform be the next?

Allowing big corporates/industrial houses to own and run banks and handing over ownership from government to private are not the only two big-ticket banking reforms in the pipeline. A third one has been in cold storage since 2018, following a huge uproar, but the possibility of its comeback can't be written off (labour reforms were put off in 2017 to be brought back in 2019 and 2020 and passed in a hurry).

That pending bank reform is ""bail-in"" provision in the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill of 2017, which proposed (Clause 52) that in case a bank fails the depositors' money will be used to bail it out (as one of the resolution tools).

Also Read: Rebooting Economy 41: India's growing poverty and hunger nobody talks about

What it means is that the depositors of such a bank will pay with their deposits to revive failed banks. Until now, public depositors and taxpayers have been bailing out banks by way of NPA write-offs and remonetisation of banks. This is an additional incentive to big corporates/industrial houses to own and run banks with public deposits. Rather, the fourth ""win"" for them and the ""fourth ""loss"" for depositors and taxpayers.

Insurance cover for bank deposits has been raised from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in the 2020 budget, which means in case a bank fails, the depositors are protected up to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh. The rest will be lost to ""bail-in"" for bailing out failed banks in case this reform is revived.

Why ""authoritarian cronyism"" is a threat?

While warning about ""authoritarian cronyism"", Rajan and Acharya omitted a few things.

The stage for such an eventuality was set with the introduction of opaque Electoral Bonds in 2017. It has opened a floodgate of unlimited and unaccounted money from anonymous corporates to donate to political parties.

Also Read: Rebooting Economy 40: Why Punjab farmers burn stubble?

Additionally, Electoral Bonds are out of legal scrutiny and disclosure norms. The Representation of People Act of 1951 has been amended to keep corporate donations through Electoral Bonds out of the scrutiny of Election Commission of India (ECI) and The Companies Act of 2013 too has been amended to remove limits on such corporate donations and disclosing the name of the political party to which such donations are being made. No wonder the ruling party is getting most of Electoral Bond donations.

In September 2019, amidst the pre-pandemic economic slowdown, the government cut corporate tax by Rs 1.45 lakh crore, even while facing difficulty to honour GST compensation payment commitment. (For more read "" Rebooting Economy XXIV: 7 critical GST flaws govt needs to address at the earliest ""). Instead of using tax cuts to invest and generate jobs as the people were told, corporates went for ""debt servicing, build-up of cash balances and other current assets rather than restarting the capex cycle"", as the RBI's Annual Report, 2019-20, later revealed.

Enough has already been written about the fresh leash of life to crony capitalism in India in recent years (most lucrative projects landing with two industrial houses close to the government) to warrant elaboration.

Enough is also known (from history) about how a cocktail of crony capitalism and a regime with poor democratic instincts can overrun any society or country.","a series of economic ""reforms"" have been unleashed since 2016 that defy economic logic. the latest is to let big corporate/industrial houses run banks. this is the only ""reform"" which hasn't dropped out of the blue at nightly live-telecasts. it is a mere proposal at present, but with far reaching consequences if pursued.",Negative

It is not often that the failure of a board of directors spills so openly into the public domain. But the ICICI Bank board, under the inept leadership of its Chairman, MK Sharma, has manged to make itself the poster child for poor corporate governance in India. It has sullied the reputation of everyone associated with it, the Chairman, the CEO, the independent directors, and the government-nominee directors.

In the other recent board battles in India, most famously in the ones at Infosys and Tata, there were at least some heroes from a corporate governance perspective that emerged in the process, like R Seshasayee or Nusli Wadia. If the chairman, CEO, or the members of the board of ICICI continue after this fiasco, it indicates that even ""shame"" as a control mechanism has limited efficacy in the country.

Let us distinguish between promoter-led companies and those with diversified stockholding and no controlling shareholder, for the purposes of corporate governance. The problem of corporate governance in promoter-led companies is that the board kowtows to the promoter, as the ""independent"" directors owe their positions to these promoters. As promoters can vote on independent directors, and minority shareholders don't frequently exercise their voting rights, even with a relatively small shareholding, the promoter is effectively appointing the independent directors.

If an independent director such as a Nusli Wadia dares to disagree with the promoter, he or she is immediately sacked. This has a chilling effect on dissent by independent directors. The promoter is all powerful and minority interests are trampled upon at will. The informal check in such cases is only the benevolence of the promoters, as I have previously noted, if they need to return to the equity markets. The savvier promoters take a long view, and thus protect their reputation among minority shareholders. But, as in any feudal system, the minions are at the mercy of the ruler.

In non-promoter led companies, one worries about the agency problem, where the managers may not align their interests with the shareholders. Without a promoter to oversee their behaviour, the professionals running the firm can enrich themselves at the expense of the shareholders. This is why in the US, where such firms are ubiquitous, a separation is sought between the Chairman and CEO positions. Since a powerful Chairman acts as a check on the CEO, at least on the boards outside India that I have served on, there is often a healthy tension between them. The worry in non-promoter companies is that an all-powerful CEO captures the board and subverts any effective oversight.

Over the years I have observed powerful CEOs deploy various mechanisms to make their boards and Chairman subservient. I will leave the readers to make their own judgment as to which of these were in play at ICICI as the board lost all control and abdicated its responsibilities.

First, there is the problem of the ""superstar"" CEOs, who through a combination of past performance, charisma, and crafty PR management, have created an aura of dominance around themselves. The board in the face of this CEO is rendered ineffective in its monitoring role. The unconscious story line that plays out on the board is: ""Who are we to question a visionary like Ratan Tata, Narayana Murthy, or Chanda Kochhar?""

Second, as the same individuals serve on multiple boards, they have limited time to really understand and investigate the true situation at the firm, and their industry-specific knowledge is inadequate. As a result, independent directors suffer from ""information capture"". Directors are overwhelmingly dependent on the information that the CEO chooses to provide or conceal. Consequently, directors end up monitoring the actions of the management through the ""filtered glasses"" provided by the same executives.

Third, and this is by no means an exhaustive list, CEOs effectively make directors complicit though various monetary and non-monetary benefits. The financial incentives for directors, such as compensation and bonus recommendations by the CEO, are well known. Academic research has documented that excess director compensation lowers monitoring of CEOs, reduces CEO turnover-performance sensitivity, and is an indicator of board entrenchment. Overcompensated directors provide CEOs with additional immunity and job security. Furthermore, excess compensation of directors is positively related to the CEO's total compensation, providing evidence of cronyism between CEOs and directors.

The numerous non-monetary benefits are behind the veil. These include jobs at the company or related firms for relatives of the directors, overseas trips to presumably understand far-flung operations and investigate opportunities. But, most importantly, among highly interconnected elites, there is the need to maintain social capital, in order to continue membership in the “club”.

In light of the above, it should not be surprising that the instinctive reaction of the board is to protect the CEO. In a sense, they are protecting themselves. The ICICI board reiterated their support of the CEO immediately as this story of potential misdeeds by Chanda Kochhar broke on the news. Similarly, despite the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) raiding the offices of R Venkataramanan, the managing trustee of Tata Trusts, him being named in the FIR filed by the CBI, and the internal emails by Venkat providing evidence of him engaging in lobbying to get the 5/20 rule for airlines removed, Tata Trusts reaffirmed its complete trust in and continued support for the managing trustee (equivalent of a CEO).

Just as at ICICI, the independent inquiry that should have been the appropriate response by the Tata Trust board, will happen only when there is no option because of a public hue and cry. The ICICI and the Tata Trust boards, from the corporate governance lens, have thus become laughing stocks when these cases are presented in any management classroom, and perhaps even in the press.

From a shareholder's (minority shareholders in case of promoter led companies) perspective, Indian boards of directors are failing. They are not exercising the necessary due diligence and loyalty to shareholders by maintaining an intense oversight of powerful CEOs and promoters. The ICICI and Tata boards epitomize this with respect to non-promoter and promoter companies.

At Infosys, the board showed more backbone and attempted to resist the pressure before eventually caving in. This is not a good omen for corporate governance in India. My contention is, as I have made elsewhere, that the more laws and regulations we impose on the boards, the more ability we provide them with to engage in symbolic governance towards external stakeholders. These box-ticking exercises provide a fig leaf to engage in less, not more, robust corporate governance.

In its report, the UN-led Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development explores the steps that governments must take to avert debt overload and address the economic and financial havoc caused by the pandemic.

""The global community was already falling behind in efforts to end poverty, take climate action and reduce inequalities,"" UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said.

""We have one chance to build back better together for people and for the planet.""

With recommendations based on joint research and analysis from more than 60 UN agencies and international institutions, the 2020 Financing for Sustainable Development Report outlines measures to address the impact of the unfolding global recession and financial turmoil – particularly in the world's poorest countries.

The COVID-19 crisis has shaken global financial markets with heavy losses and intense volatility that has prompted investors to move around USD 90 billion out of emerging markets – the largest outflow ever recorded.

Particularly alarming for many Least Developed Countries (LDCs) is the prospect of a new debt crisis. To mitigate this, 2020 Financing for Sustainable Development calls, among other things, suspending debt payments from LDCs and other low-income countries; strengthening the global financial safety net; and reversing the decline in official development assistance.

“We are far from having a global package to help the developing world to create the conditions both to suppress the disease and to address the dramatic consequences in their populations,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said during the recent launch of his report on the Socioeconomic Impact of the COVID-19.

“What is needed is a large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive multilateral response amounting to at least 10 per cent of global Gross Domestic Product,” he added.

Beyond the immediate crisis response, the coronavirus pandemic should prompt the implementation of long-overdue measures to reset the world on a sustainable development path and make the global economy more resilient to future shocks.

To do this, the report recommends accelerating investment in resilient infrastructure; strengthening social protections; enhancing regulatory frameworks; and strengthen the international financial safety net and framework for debt sustainability.

While highlighting gaps, new challenges and risks, the current crisis also provides a timely example of the potential of digital technologies.

As lockdowns and physical distancing have become the norm, digital communication tools have helped keep people connected and provided online platforms for children to continue their education.

But many workers in the so-called “gig economy”, dominated by service sector start-ups, are poorly protected against income losses in a recession. 2020 Financing for Sustainable Development addresses these gaps and other opportunities and challenges of digital finance.

“Only a collective response, inspired by shared responsibility and solidarity, will suffice to address the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs and Chair of the Task Force that issued the report Liu Zhenmin said.

“Governments, development partners, the private sector and other stakeholders must work together to combat COVID-19 and support every effort to address its social and economic impacts,” he said.","the report outlines measures to address the impact of the unfolding global recession and financial turmoil. it calls for suspending debt payments from low-income countries and strengthening the global financial safety net. the report also calls for a new debt crisis. it also calls for a large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive multilateral response. the report is based on research and analysis from more than 60 UN agencies and international institutions.",Negative

https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/coronavirus-sends-germany-into-recession-to-last-to-mid-year/1929164/,"Europe’s economic powerhouse Germany plunged into recession in March, with the slump sparked by the coronavirus pandemic likely to last until the middle of the year, the economy ministry said Wednesday.

“Falling global demand, interruption of supply chains, changes in consumers’ behaviour and uncertainty among investors” had all made themselves felt in the export giant, the ministry said.

The economic blow from the virus fell just as Germany was beginning to recover from a 2019 marked by the impact of trade wars and Brexit fears.

Industry in particular had seen rises in new orders and activity as 2020 got underway, the ministry noted.

But “given the massive demand and supply shock at home and abroad from the coronavirus pandemic, economic developments reversed course” for manufacturers, it said.

At home, Germany has been in progressively tighter lockdown since mid-March, with Chancellor Angela Merkel set to discuss with state premiers Wednesday whether to extend restrictions beyond the present April 19 cutoff date.

“Even if the first protective measures can be loosened somewhat (after April), growth will remain very muted and only revive bit by bit,” the economy ministry forecast.

To cushion some of the blow, Berlin has passed a rescue package totalling 1.1 trillion euros, ranging from guarantees for bank lending to business to a state fund that could buy up stakes in stricken companies if necessary.

The federal government also eased access to a scheme that tops up workers’ wages if their employer slashes hours.

The BA federal labour agency said some 725,000 companies had applied for the assistance, adding that the number of workers affected will likely be “significantly” above the 1.4 million helped in the 2008-9 financial crisis.

https://www.financialexpress.com/market/commodities/half-the-trucks-parked-workless-fuel-demand-may-slump-to-5-year-low-diesel-outlook-bleak/2066791/,"India’s oil-product demand is set to slump to a five-year low this financial year, with a bleak outlook for diesel consumption as the nation’s truck operators idle vehicles and consider cutting the size of their fleets.

About half of India’s trucks are parked up without work and the nation’s biggest operator is shunning new purchases and may downsize after demand crashed due to the pandemic. The workhorses of industry that haul goods all over the country are the biggest consumers of diesel, the most used transport fuel in India and a useful proxy for its economic health.

The drag on diesel along with the plunge in jet fuel demand is set to weigh on India’s rebound from the coronavirus. Overall oil-product consumption including transport fuels in the financial year through March 2021 will be around 90% of last year, according to oil refinery executives. That would be the lowest level since 2016.

Demand rebounded to about 70% to 80% of pre-virus levels after an initial nationwide lockdown was eased in June. It’s expected to climb to around 90% in the three months through March 2021, according to Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Refineries Director Vinod S. Shenoy.

India’s truckers are facing multiples headwinds that are crimping diesel consumption and overall oil demand. Localized lockdowns after a flare-up in infections is slowing economic activity, while tax hikes on the industrial fuel over the past few years have eroded the transport companies’ profits.

Idled Trucks

“High diesel costs and forced lockdowns have indeed devastated the transport sector and the economy,” said Naveen Kumar Gupta, secretary general of the All India Motors Transport Congress, which represents almost 10 million truckers. “There is a remote chance of its revival in the current financial year,” he said, adding that about 50% of the country’s truck fleet is idle.

Gasoline will be the fuel that comes closest to making a complete recovery as people stick to driving their own cars to avoid crowded buses and trains, according to the refinery executives who asked not to be named because they’re not authorized to speak to the media.

The slowdown this year has decimated purchases of new trucks and buses, with sales by Tata Motors Ltd. through April to June at a 10th of what it sold in the same period last year. Sales by Ashok Leyland Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. slumped more than 90% in the four months through July.

https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/indias-fiscal-deficit-may-shoot-to-6-2-of-gdp-in-fy21-fitch-solutions/1915914/,"India’s fiscal deficit in 2020-21 may shoot up to 6.2 per cent of the GDP from 3.5 per cent government estimate as a fallout of the Covid-19 economic stimulus package, Fitch Solutions said on Wednesday.

With businesses disrupted due to the lockdown and its ripple effects, revenue will come under “heavy pressure” and may force the government to look towards additional borrowing and/or a higher central bank dividend to fund its expenditure, it said.

“At Fitch Solutions, we are revising our forecast for India’s FY2020/21 (April-March) central government fiscal deficit to widen to 6.2 per cent of GDP, from 3.8 per cent of GDP previously (estimated by Fitch Solutions), which reflects our view that the government will miss its initial target of 3.5 per cent by a wider margin,” the agency said.

Underpinning the revised forecast are weaker revenue collection as a result of a sharp virus-driven downturn in economic activity and higher expenditures aimed at softening Covid-19’s economic shock.

Stating that weak economic activity will likely see revenue collection contract in 2020-21, Fitch Solutions said receipts may contract by 1 per cent from a growth of 11.8 per cent previously.

“We have revised our FY2020/21 real GDP growth forecast to 4.6 per cent, from 5.4 per cent previously, to reflect our view for growth to weaken further from our estimate of 4.9 per cent in FY2019/20 due to both economic disruptions due to domestic movement restrictions and weak global demand,” it said.

The government declared a 21-day nationwide lockdown beginning March 25. “The rushed implementation of the lockdown which gave its citizens only a few hours to prepare has reportedly caused many rural migrants in the cities to be left without food and shelter, prompting them to return to their villages, either on the last remaining carriers or on foot.”

The mass migration of such workers raises a significant risk of a larger Covid-19 outbreak across the country, it said, adding the rural areas reportedly have fewer coronavirus cases versus the cities as of end-March and the perceived safety of the rural areas has given another reason for the migrant workers to return home.

“As such, we see virus-led economic disruptions extending for several quarters, which will weigh heavily on personal and corporate income tax collections for the year,” it said. At the same time, expenditures are expected to surge as the government responds to the Covid-19 crisis both on an economic and social front over 2020-21.

“We forecast expenditures to rise by 22.2 per cent despite lower revenue collection,” it said. “Faced with a humanitarian crisis brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, we believe that the central government will have no choice but to increase their spending, over and above what they have planned for in 2020-21 Union Budget and the Rs 1.7 lakh crore (0.8 per cent of GDP) fiscal stimulus package it released on March 26.”

The package included cash handouts, free food for the poor, medical insurance for medical staff, and a temporary regulatory amendment for employees of small companies to dip into their pension fund to fund their expenditures in the meantime.

Fitch Solutions said the Rs 1.7 lakh crore fiscal stimulus is “inadequate to provide support the economy of India’s size amid a likely global recession”. “In contrast, countries such as Singapore and the US have already announced stimulus packages worth 11 per cent and 10 per cent of GDP, respectively, and still are prepared to do more if necessary,” it said.

“As such, we expect additional stimulus packages to be announced by the Indian central government over the coming months, and have accordingly factored this into our deficit forecast revision.”","government's fiscal deficit in 2020-21 may shoot up to 6.2 per cent of GDP. this is a fallout of the covid-19 economic stimulus package, it said. underpinning the revised forecast are weaker revenue collection. the government declared a 21-day nationwide lockdown beginning march 25. it said rural migrants in the cities were left without food and shelter.",Negative
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-european-leaders-weigh-reopening-risks-without-a-vaccine-5280711.html,"On a weekend when many pandemic-weary people emerged from weeks of lockdown, leaders in the U.S. and Europe weighed the risks and rewards of lifting COVID-19 restrictions knowing that a vaccine could take years to develop.

In separate stark warnings, two major European leaders bluntly told their citizens that the world needs to adapt to living with the coronavirus and cannot wait to be saved by a vaccine.

“We are confronting this risk, and we need to accept it, otherwise we would never be able to relaunch,” Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte said, acceding to a push by regional leaders to allow restaurants, bars and beach facilities to open Monday, weeks ahead of an earlier timetable.

The warnings from Conte and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson came as governments worldwide and many U.S. states struggled with restarting economies blindsided by the pandemic. In the U.S., images of crowded bars, beaches and boardwalks suggested some weren’t heeding warnings to safely enjoy reopened spaces while limiting the risks of spreading infection.

Britain’s Johnson, who was hospitalized last month with a serious bout of COVID-19, speculated Sunday that a vaccine may not be developed at all, despite the huge global effort to produce one.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

“There remains a very long way to go, and I must be frank that a vaccine might not come to fruition,” Johnson wrote in the Mail on Sunday newspaper.

President Donald Trump, by contrast, promised Americans a speedy return to normalcy that sounded far more optimistic than most experts say is realistic.

“We’re looking at vaccines, we’re looking at cures and we are very, very far down the line,” he said while calling into a charity golf tournament broadcast Sunday broadcast on NBC. “I think that’s not going to be in the very distant future. But even before that, I think we’ll be back to normal.”

Trump said events would likely resume with small crowds — if any — but hopes that, by the time the Masters Tournament is played in November, the crowds can return.

Health experts, however, say the world could be months, if not years, away from having a vaccine available to everyone, and they have warned that easing restrictions too quickly could cause the virus to rebound.

With 36 million newly unemployed in the U.S. alone, economic pressures are building even as authorities acknowledge that reopening risks setting off new waves of infections and deaths.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed optimism Sunday that the U.S. economy could begin to recover in the second half of the year, assuming there isn’t a second wave. But he suggested that a full recovery won’t likely be possible before the arrival of a vaccine.

In an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Powell said that, once the outbreak has been contained, the economy should be able to rebound “substantially,” while warning it would take much longer for the economy to regain its health than it took for it to collapse.

The coronavirus has infected over 4.7 million people and killed more than 315,000 worldwide, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts say under counts the true toll of the pandemic. The U.S. has reported over 89,000 dead and Europe has seen at least 160,000 deaths.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to death.

Some experts noted recent infection surges in Texas, including a 1,800-case jump Saturday, with Amarillo identified as a growing hot spot. Texas officials said increased testing was playing a big role — the more you look for something, the more you find it. Many are watching hospitalizations and death rates in the weeks ahead to see exactly what the new Texas numbers really mean.

But Texas was one of the earliest states to allow stores and restaurants to reopen, and Dr. Michael Saag at the University of Alabama at Birmingham called Texas “a warning shot” for states to closely watch any surges in cases and have plans to swiftly take steps to stop them.

“No one knows for sure exactly the right way forward, and what I think we’re witnessing is a giant national experiment,” said Saag, an infectious diseases researcher.

In the U.S., many states have lifted stay-at-home orders and other restrictions, allowing some types of businesses to reopen.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, told CNN on Sunday that he was concerned to see images of a crowded bar in Columbus, on the first day that outdoor dining establishments were allowed to reopen.

“We made the decision to start opening up Ohio, and about 90% of our economy is back open, because we thought it was a huge risk not to open,” he said. “But we also know it’s a huge risk in opening.”

The Isle of Palms, one of South Carolina’s most popular beaches, saw a rush of visitors this weekend— with Mayor Jimmy Carroll calling Saturday the busiest day he has seen in his more than 60 years there. But police said almost everyone on the beach and in the ocean was staying a safe distance apart.

Houses of worship are beginning to look ahead to resumption of in-person services, with some eyeing that shift this month. But the challenges are steeper in states with ongoing public health restrictions.

In Elgin, Illinois, Northwest Bible Baptist Church had sought to welcome back worshipers on Sunday, preparing to scan people’s temperatures and purchasing protective equipment. But that was postponed after local authorities raised questions.

The church’s preparations were “more than what they’d had to do if they were at Home Depot or Lowe’s or Walmart,” said Jeremy Dys, a counsel at First Liberty Institute, the legal nonprofit representing Northwest Bible Baptist. “Somehow people going to church are incapable, it’s insinuated, of safely gathering.”

Underscoring the tradeoffs involved in resuming such gatherings, officials in California’s Butte County announced Friday that a congregant had tested positive for the virus after attending a Mother’s Day church event that drew more than 180 people.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has suggested that early predictions were overblown. On Monday, Florida restaurants will be allowed to operate at 50% capacity, as can retail shops, museums and libraries.

Paula Walborsky, a 74-year-old retired attorney in Tallahassee, Florida, has resisted the temptation to get her hair done and turned down dinner invitations from close friends. But when one of her city’s public swimming pools reopened by appointment, she decided to test the waters.

“I was so excited to be back in the water, and it just felt wonderful,” Walborsky said.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo got tested for the coronavirus on live television Sunday. Any New Yorkers experiencing flu-like symptoms or those returning to work can now get tested, Cuomo said.

“We’re all talking about what is the spread of the virus when you increase economic activity. Well, how do you know what the spread of the virus is?

https://www.financialexpress.com/market/borrowing-spike-not-to-deter-huge-public-capex-slippage-analysts/1964384/,"Despite the hikes in borrowing by the Centre and states, the big revenue hole will imply that they will still have combined ‘uncovered (revenue) loss’ of Rs 7.56 lakh crore in FY21, SBI EcoWrap has estimated. This, in turn, could debilitate general government capital expenditure. The researchers warned that states’ capital expenditure in FY21 might turn out to be half the budgeted level of Rs 8.8 lakh crore. They also noted that the Centre’s budgeted capex for the current fiscal year might be equivalent to its uncovered loss of Rs 4.36 lakh crore, implying a huge potential cut in its capex too.

FE has recently reported state governments have applied brakes on capital expenditure in the second half of FY20. An analysis by FE of the finances of 14 state governments showed that their capex declined marginally in April-February of FY20 compared with about 20% growth in such expenditure in the corresponding period of previous fiscal. Given that only 58% of the FY20 capex target of Rs 3.6 lakh crore was achieved in the first eleven months, these states must have witnessed huge capex slippage for the whole of the year. Going by SBI research, what the states are going to witness is a unprecedented deep fall in capex that started somewhere in the middle of last fiscal and through FY21.

Public capex has been a key driver of economic activities in the past few years in the absence of strong private support. In recent years, the ratio of public capex has been roughly in the 5:5.5:3.5 ratio among the CPSEs, states (budget) and the Centre (Budget).

The SBI researchers also highlighted that out of Rs 4.28 lakh crore extra borrowing limit for states, only up to Rs 3.13 lakh crore (73%) might be actually utilised by the state governments in FY21. Based on an analysis of 20 states, SBI chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh said only eight of them are in a position to fulfil all the reform conditions stipulated by the Centre and avail of the extra borrowing limit of 2% of gross state domestic product.

“We find some of the states like West Bengal, Telangana, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh need to fulfil the conditional ties to avail of the borrowings,” Ghosh said. “For instance, West Bengal and Odisha have not adopted the UDAY programme, so they can’t benefit entirely,” he said.

Analysts say the increase in borrowing limit is unlikely to require amendment in the FRBM Act for individual states. This, because the Act also permits ‘exceeding annual fiscal deficit target due to ground or grounds of national security, act of war, national calamity, collapse of agriculture severely affecting farm output and incomes, structural reforms in the economy with unanticipated fiscal implications, decline in real output growth of a quarter by at least three per cent points below its average of the previous four quarters”.

Pronab Sen, noted economist and former chief statistician, told FE the Centre shouldn’t have applied conditions for granting a one-time relaxation on the borrowing limit, that too, for just a year and for a specific crisis.

“The bigger, richer states can tap the window fully by complying with the reform measures, but what about the relatively poor ones,” he asked.

“States collectively may have already lost revenue of just under 1% of the GDP (close to `2 lakh crore) and they will lose more later. So about 1.5% of the extra borrowing limit, in any case, will essentially go towards meeting the revenue loss. The additional 0.5%, which is a small amount, can then be utilised to tackle the pandemic. And they have to take care of other issues, including the one involving migrant labourers,” Sen said. He added that the Centre, too, had raised its own borrowing target, without pegging it to any reform condition.

Even states’ human resources are stretched, given the social distancing norms. Imposing reform measures at a time when they are at the forefront of battling the Covid-19 crisis isn’t a good step, some analysts said. Whether states use this extra borrowing window or not, is their choice, but giving that choice to them is critical, they added.

“The time-frame is limited, so one can’t expect everything (all borrowings) in a year in these unprecedented times when the focus is on pure survival,” SBI’s Ghosh said.

Most difficult reforms could be the rolling out direct benefit transfer (DBT) for electricity subsidy to farmers and households. Some states like Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Punjab are in the process of rolling out power subsidy directly to the bank accounts of beneficiaries, instead of routing it through power discoms, whose finances have worsened due to non-release of their dues by respective state governments.

“States should pay the farmer the cost of electricity and let farmer pay to discoms so that we know that subsidy actually goes to farmers,” expenditure secretary TV Somanathan said on a news channel. “Many states say that there are leakages and this will help reduce these leakages… Power theft can’t be shown by states as free supply to farmers,” Somanathan said.",researchers warn that states' capital expenditure in FY21 might turn out to be half the budgeted level of Rs 8.8 lakh crore. they also noted that the Centre's budgeted capex for the current fiscal year might be equivalent to its uncovered loss of Rs 4.36 lakh crore. a huge potential cut in capex could also be triggered by the big revenue hole.,Negative
https://www.livemint.com/Politics/vXCcM9XRiiRiJ2uZ9tnuiJ/China-warns-of-retaliation-if-US-slaps-new-tariffs.html,"Beijing: China will be forced to retaliate if the United States implements any new tariff measures, China’s commerce ministry warned on Thursday, as the world’s two biggest economies remain locked in an intensifying trade war.

Global markets were on edge after US President Donald Trump threatened fresh tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports.

“If the United States, regardless of opposition, adopts any new tariff measures, China will be forced to roll out necessary retaliatory measures,"" ministry spokesman Gao Feng told a regular news conference.

China will closely monitor the impact from any fresh tariffs and adopt strong measures to help Chinese or foreign firms operating in China to overcome difficulties, said Gao.

The Trump administration is ready to move ahead with a next round of tariffs after a public comment period ends at midnight in Washington on Thursday, but the timing is uncertain, people familiar with the administration’s plans told Reuters.

The new duties will start to hit consumer products directly, including furniture, lighting products, tires, bicycles and car seats for babies.

China and the United States have already slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on $50 billion of each other’s goods, spooking financial markets in recent months as investors and policy makers worried the bitter trade war could derail global growth.

Trump is demanding Beijing improve market access and intellectual property protections for U.S. companies, cut industrial subsidies and slash a $375 billion trade gap.

Markets fear any fresh US duties on Chinese imports will mark a major escalation in the trade dispute between the world’s two economic giants, potentially causing significant drag on global business investment, trade and growth.

In August, China unveiled a proposed list of retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion of US goods ranging from liquefied natural gas to certain types of aircraft, in response to the US measures.

Trump said on Wednesday that the United States was not yet ready to come to an agreement over trade disputes with China but he said talks would continue.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sp-rating-affirmation-gives-only-breathing-space-to-indian-policymakers-5387631.html,"The risk of a second successive sovereign rating downgrade in a week has gone away for the moment. At least that’s the sense one gets with global rating agency Standard and Poor’s Global Ratings on Wednesday affirming India’s 'BBB-' long-term and 'A-3' short-term unsolicited foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings. The agency said the outlook on the long-term rating is stable. The ratings, S&P said, reflects India’s above-average real GDP growth, sound external profile, and evolving monetary settings. But this gives only a temporary relief for Indian policymakers for obvious reasons. Nevertheless, this is a relief.

Why is this important to India?

Just around a week ago, another global rating agency, Moody’s, had announced a downgrade to India’s sovereign ratings to ‘Baa3’ from ‘Baa2’ citing a range of risks to the Indian economy. The risks highlighted include slow policy implementation, probability of a prolonged slowdown, significant deterioration in government’s fiscal position, and more worryingly, the high risk of bad loans in the financial sector on account of a fast-slowing economy. Although Moody’s was merely aligning the rating view to that of other agencies, there were speculations that a rating downgrade could follow from other rating agencies. This fear has disappeared for now since S&P has decided to stick to the BBB- rating.

A second successive downgrade in a week could have had catastrophic effect on the already down investor sentiments, would have weighed on stock markets eroding massive investor wealth and would have certainly added pressure on the policymakers who are desperately trying to address the chaotic economic conditions severely impacted by the onslaught of COVID-19 and its continuing ripple effects across all segments of the economy. The government, walking a thin line on fiscal management, has been unsuccessful so far to give confidence to the stakeholders offering a fitting fiscal stimulus. It has so far managed to ask banks to launch various loan schemes while the direct spending to boost demand has been a disappointing minuscule one percent of the GDP.

As mentioned above, Moody’s downgrade wasn’t a big negative for the markets and the financial sector since this was only a reversal of its earlier rate action. In 2017, the agency had upgraded India’s rating in 2017 approving this government’s reform policies. Hence, by downgrading now, the agency was only reversing this rating action after its assessment probably went wrong on reforms. The reform juggernaut has slowed in Asia’s third-largest economy since then except for a corporate tax cut. Investors didn’t overreact with Moody’s rating action since this was essentially going back to the stance of other raters.

Even though S&P has left the sovereign rating untouched, it has raised important warning signals to Indian policymakers. What are those?

Firstly, ""the stable outlook reflects our expectation that India's economy will recover following the containment of COVID-19 pandemic and the country will maintain its sound net external position,"" S&P said while affirming India's rating at 'BBB-' and maintaining a stable outlook. Secondly, the agency’s stable outlook of India also assumes that the government's fiscal deficit will recede markedly following a multi-year high in fiscal year 2021, it added.

In other words, the Indian economy is not yet out of the danger zone of a sovereign rating downgrade if the government fails to act in getting the economy back to the growth orbit at the earliest and rein in the fiscal deficit. S&P rating call is a major wake-up call.","the agency said the outlook on the long-term rating is stable. but this gives only a temporary relief for Indian policymakers. just around a week ago, another global rating agency, Moody’s, had announced a downgrade to India’s sovereign ratings to ‘Baa3’ from ‘Baa2’. the risks highlighted include slow policy implementation, probability of a prolonged slowdown, significant deterioration in government’s fiscal position, and more worryingly, the high risk of bad loans",Negative
https://www.financialexpress.com/market/costly-money-firms-may-pay-more-as-govt-borrows-at-6-5/1924126/,"The government on Thursday paid a high 6.5299% to mop up 10-year money in a sign companies may need to fork out more for their borrowings. The rate was higher than the yield on the benchmark which closed the day’s session at 6.49%, five basis points higher than Wednesday’s close and an over two-month high. The rising risk-free rate threatens to drive up borrowing costs for companies many of whom are already finding it hard to borrow at affordable rates.

Investors in the bond markets have been nervous as they anticipate the government’s borrowings for 2020-21 will be higher than planned given it might announce a fiscal stimulus to help fight the slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The yield on the benchmark has jumped some 35 basis points in four sessions to Thursday. Banks are now the main investors in the bond markets given mutual funds are faced with redemptions and insurers may see premium inflows slowing.

Ananth Narayan, professor-finance at SPJIMR, told FE the combined deficit for FY21 would be far higher than budgeted and that this fear explained the rising yields. “Both the SDL and G-sec auctions this week suffered from this excess supply in a market that has been operationally constricted quite severely by the Covid-19 situation. Eventually, the RBI will have to come in, buy bonds, and bridge the gap between supply and demand,” Narayan said.

Thursday also saw banks borrowing Rs 25,000 crore via three-year targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO); the funds, which need to be used to buy corporate paper, are raised at close to the repo rate of 4.40%.

Siddharth Shah, head, treasury at STCI Primary Dealer, said the auction had sailed through given the extent of fiscal worries and the large size of Rs 10,000 crore for the 10-year paper. “The 10-year bond was expected to see support at 6.50% unless some negative news hits the market. The two uncertainties right now are how much further stimulus will the government announce and whether the RBI will absorb any of the potential additional borrowing by the government,” Shah said.

Of the three securities, the bonds maturing in 2022 received bids worth over six times the notified amount of Rs 3,000 crore. The cut-off yield for the paper stood at 5.09%. The 40-year bonds maturing in 2060 as well as the 10-year benchmark bonds received bids worth more than twice their notified amounts with their respective cut-off yields at 7.19% and 6.5299%.The RBI said the greenshoe option was exercised in the paper maturing in 2022 where a further Rs 2,000 crore was accepted over and above the notified amount of Rs 3,000 crore.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/2020-emissions-precedent-setting-or-bucking-the-trend/articleshow/79986949.cms,"PARIS: For a few moments in late April of 2020, oil -- normally the lifeblood of the world economy -- became more expensive to store than to pay someone to take it away.Crude oil's wildly fluctuating futures prices reflected the impact of the coronavirus pandemic , with record falls in greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel demand making 2020 an unexpectedly good year for the climate.The United Nations and the Global Carbon Project both said this month that planet-warming carbon pollution was set to fall seven percent this year, the largest single-year drop in history.As pressure mounts on governments to match action to their promises to slash emissions, such a historic drop is welcome even if it only came about due to the pandemic.It puts 2020 roughly in line with what the UN says is needed to keep the Paris climate deal goal of limiting warming to 1.5C within reach.But with distribution of several Covid-19 vaccines ramping up in 2021, enabling an anticipated global economic rebound, will 2020 be the start of an annual downward emissions trend, or just a momentary blip?""I am afraid that if governments do not take major new policies we may well see that the decline we are experiencing in emissions this year will rebound,"" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, told AFP.""If governments do not put clean energy policies in their economic recovery packages we will go back to where we were before the pandemic.""Birol pointed to China, the world's largest polluter, which he said was an ""important test run"" for how other nations power their Covid-19 recovery.""We all know China was the first country to have the coronavirus, the first where there was a lockdown and where the economy declined,"" he said.""But China is also the first country where the economy rebounded and as of today Chinese emissions are higher than levels before the crisis.""The UN in its annual Emissions Gap report said last week that 2020's dip in emissions would have only a ""negligible impact"" on long-term warming without a profound shift towards green energy.It said emissions hit a record high in 2019 of 59.1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent -- a whopping 2.6 percent higher than the year before.Yet the countries that pollute the most have prioritised sectors heavily reliant on fossil fuels in their stimulus packages.In October, a study by manufacturer Wartsila and Energy Policy Tracker found that G20 nations had earmarked $145 billion for clean energy solutions as part of their recovery funding.This compared with $216 billion that had been pledged for fossil energy, the analysis showed.The UN said this month that production of oil, gas and coal needed to fall 6 percent annually through 2030 to stay on a 1.5-C course.Its Production Gap assessment showed however that countries plan to increase fossil fuel production 2 percent per year this decade.This is despite record low costs for renewable energy technology such as solar and wind.Kingsmill Bond, energy strategist at the market watchdog Carbon Tracker, said he was confident that 2019 would turn out to have been the peak in emissions, as industry wakes up to the new economics of power.He said the ""cyclical shock"" of Covid-19 had brought forward a downwards trend in carbon pollution which was set to happen anyway, pandemic or not.""Global coal demand peaked in 2013. Fossil fuels going into electricity peaked in 2018, even before the crisis. It's been happening all the while,"" Bond told AFP.He said renewables could now accommodate all global energy demand growth -- roughly 6 exajoules per year -- meaning that fossil fuel demand should peak ""by definition"".To square the circle between the needed six-percent annual cut in fossil production and countries' two-percent growth plans, Bond pointed to a fundamental economic principle: supply and demand.""The supply is continuing to churn because the incumbents haven't realised what's going on -- there's just not going to be demand for it,"" he said.""Imagine you're the Canadian government. You can subsidise production of oil as much as you like, but if the Chinese don't buy it, tough.""Subsidies -- in the form of financial support, tax breaks and underwriting -- remain a significant impediment to greening the economy.IEA chief Birol said the G20 currently spends a total of over $300 billion in ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies.""Fossil fuels today enjoy a significant amount of subsidies from governments, mainly in emerging economies, which creates unfair competition for clean energy sources, distorts the markets and leads to inefficient use of energy,"" he said.As well as an unprecedented drop in emissions, 2020 saw numerous large emitters -- including China and Japan -- commit to achieving carbon neutrality for the first time.Climate Action Tracker has calculated that countries' current net-zero plans, if enacted, could limit warming to 2.1C -- not Paris-compliant, but better than the current course of more than 3C of heating by 2100.Corinne Le Quere, a climatologist and co-chair of the Global Carbon Project, said she expected emissions to rebound in 2021 and to plateau in the years to follow.She said 2019 could be the peak-emissions year ""in an optimistic scenario, but not in the most realistic scenario"".""We will either see a plateau or growth in emissions for some years before green investments"" begin to pay off, said Le Quere.And although emissions tumbled in 2020, the climate responds to greenhouse gas levels already in the atmosphere.The Global Monitoring Laboratory at the Mauna Loa Observatory on December 8th measured CO2 concentrations at 412.87 parts per million -- 0.36 percent higher than the same day last year.""It's like water in a bathtub,"" said Le Quere.""For the last 100 years we have had the tap open and the water running, increasing the volume of CO2 in the atmosphere.""In 2020, we turned the tap down a little, but the water level continues to rise.""","iea chief: if governments don't take major new policies we may see decline in emissions. if governments don't put clean energy policies in economic recovery packages, we will go back to where we were before pandemic. iea chief: ""if governments do not put clean energy policies in their economic recovery packages we will go back to where we were before the crisis""",Negative
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/infra-work-worth-rs-50000-cr-to-begin-this-fiscal-kerala-fm-2527345.html,"The CPI(M) led LDF government in Kerala has lined up Rs 50,000 crore worth infrastructure work for the current fiscal to revive the economy, badly hit by demonetisation and implementation of GST, State Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac said today.

Of this amount, administrative sanction had already been accorded to works worth Rs 20,000 crore and approval for the remaining would also be given soon, he said.

Stating that Kerala as well as the nation was in the grip of a fiscal crisis after the note ban and implementation of GST, Isaac claimed this state government initiative was one of the biggest packages ever announced in the country.

He said the fiscal problem faced by the state would not affect the proposed investments.

Isaac was replying to a calling attention in the assembly on the need to solve the fiscal crisis faced by many sectors in Kerala due to demonetisation and GST implementation.

Rejecting the opposition UDF's charge that the state government has not taken any steps to rejuvenate the economy, he announced that Rs 50,000 crore worth infrastructure work had been lined up for this fiscal.

""Actual work for these projects will start this year itself"", he said, adding this would definitely give a fillip to the state's financial status.

Isaac said the setback the state had due to GST was expected to be over in the coming days.

Demonetisation had badly affected the co-operative sector in the state, he said and alleged that the Centre attempted to 'destroy' the sector under the cover of the note ban.

As LDF was committed to safeguard this sector, the process of setting up the Kerala Bank was on, he said.

The government plans to set up the bank by merging district Co-operative banks with state Co-operative banks.

The three-tie society would become a two-tier system with the formation of Kerala Bank, he said.","the state government has lined up Rs 50,000 crore worth of infrastructure work. the state is badly hit by demonetisation and implementation of GST. the state is in the grip of a fiscal crisis after the note ban and implementation of GST. the state government has already sanctioned works worth Rs 20,000 crore. the remaining works will also be approved soon, state finance minister says.",Negative

https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/cpse-closure-plans-stuck-only-two-tiny-firms-have-wound-up-since-2014/1443936/,"While the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is beginning to impart momentum to the way industrial sickness is resolved without the assets in question losing much value, a scheme announced by the NDA government in September 2016 would have complemented this process by fast-tracking the closure of perennially sick central public sector enterprises (CPSEs).

However, it has managed to complete the winding up of only two of the 19 sick CPSEs that have been approved for closure since it came to power in 2014. In the case of another about 10 such CPSEs recommended for closure by the Niti Aayog, the government is yet to take a call, while its ‘revival plan’ for the mammoth Air India, which is deep in the red, carries little conviction.

The under-achievement in liquidating terminally sick CPSEs is being ascribed to stay orders put by courts (mostly on petitions filed by workers’ unions and banks), delays in disposal of lands and other immovable assets and non-payment of statutory dues like salaries and taxes.

While two relatively small companies — Indian Oil —CREDA Biofuels and CREDA-HPCL Biofuels — are the ones that completed the closure formalities, many large loss-making firms that are a drain on the exchequer, including Hindustan Photo Films, HMT Watches, Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals (IDPL) and Tungabhadra Steel Products, are still awaiting closure.

The CPSE sickness has been a intractable issue for many years, with its deleterious impact on government finances and the erosion of capital assets created. There were 188 government companies and corporations with accumulated losses of Rs 1,23,194 crore as on March 31, 2017. Of these, the net worth of 71 companies had been completely eroded by their accumulated losses.

In FY18, there were 71 loss-making CPSEs which posted combined losses of Rs 31,261 crore, up 14% y-o-y.

During the tenure of the NDA government, nearly 3,000 acres of land belonging to 19 units were disposed of with the CPSEs either returning the land to the respective state governments or selling the immovable asset to public or private agencies. Of the remaining 4,000-acre land in their possession, a sizeable chunk will be used for the affordable housing projects of the Centre, while the balance land parcels are entangled in disputes over titles and other records and are mostly under litigation.

So far, about 6,000-odd staff of these entities have taken VRS or they have been retrenched. In many cases, employees have gone to the court against VRS conditions and have obtained stay orders on the closure process. In some cases, lenders too have got stay on the process as their dues have not been cleared.

The name of a company can’t be struck of the registrar of companies if statutory dues are not settled. For example, in the case of HMT Watches, which got the Cabinet approval for closure in 2016, 813 employees were relieved on VRS while 2 were terminated. However, 146 employees at its facility in Ranibagh (Uttarakhand) did not opt for VRS and challenged the decision in the high court, which granted a stay. However, the company’s land and buildings in Bengaluru and Tumkur were sold to Isro and some to Gail.

Similarly, in HMT Tractor case, 850 out of its 1,000-odd employees opted for VRS. But, 150 workmen did not avail of VRS and moved the court and the closure has to wait till the case is adjudicated.

“The government is literally struggling to close down the sick CPSEs which are a drag on the exchequer,” an official said.

The Cabinet approved closure of Ooty-based Hindustan Photo Films in October 2004. But the process had remained stuck for 13 years owing to a litigation over VRS terms. The Madras High Court finally resolved the matter related to the compensation to some employees in 2017. Even though it has virtually no operations for years, Hindustan Photo Films continues to be one of the top loss-making CPSEs with annual losses of about Rs 3,000 crore each for the past several years due to unpaid liabilities including loans. It made a loss of Rs 2,917 crore in FY18.","only two of 19 CPSEs approved for closure since it came to power in 2014. under-achievement in liquidating terminally sick CPSEs is being ascribed to stay orders put by courts. 71 loss-making CPSEs posted combined losses of Rs 31,261 crore. despite this, the government is yet to take a call on the'revival plan' for the mammoth air india.",Negative

Japan reported more than 500 new cases for the first time Thursday, a worrisome rise since it has the world’s oldest population and COVID-19 can be especially serious in the elderly. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency, but not a lockdown, in Tokyo and six other prefectures earlier this week. Companies in the world’s third-largest economy have been slow to embrace working from home, and many commuters were on Tokyo’s streets as usual.

India, whose 1.3 billion people are under a lockdown until next week, has sealed dozens of hot spots in and around the capital, and will supply residents with food and medicine while not allowing them to leave. The number of confirmed cases exceeds 5,000, with 166 deaths, according to India’s Health Ministry.

Meanwhile, deaths, hospitalizations and new infections have been leveling off in places like Italy and Spain, which together have more than 30,000 deaths. Even New York has seen encouraging signs amid the gloom.

At the same time, politicians and health officials warn that the crisis is far from over and a catastrophic second wave could hit if countries let down their guard too soon.

We are flattening the curve because we are rigorous about social distancing, New York state Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. But it’s not a time to be complacent. It’s not a time to do anything different than we’ve been doing.

The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has climbed to about 1.5 million worldwide, with nearly 90,000 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

The true numbers are almost certainly much higher, because of limited testing, different rules for counting the dead and concealment by some governments.

The US has by far the most confirmed cases, with over 430,000 people infected. New York state on Wednesday recorded its highest one-day increase in deaths, 779, for an overall death toll of almost 6,300, more than 40% of the U.S. total of around 15,000.

The bad news is actually terrible, Cuomo said. Still, the governor said hospitalizations are decreasing and many of those now dying fell ill in the outbreak’s earlier stages. In a sign of how much the virus has affected air travel, the number of Americans getting on airplanes sank to a level not seen since the 1950s, the dawn of the jet age.

PV sales to decline 20-24% if GDP growth falls below 1% in FY21

CV and two-wheelers sales to see 32-35% and 27-30% slump, respectively

Industry to go back by a decade with volumes of 2.15 million units -- last seen in FY11.

Industry to log double digit decline in sales for two financial years in a row -- first time ever

Impact on suppliers and dealers yet to be estimated, but likely to be even worse

Sale of passenger vehicles could decline by as much as 20-24 per cent in financial year 2020-21 in the worst case scenario as a result of the impact of a long drawn out recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in India, calculations made by industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has revealed.

These numbers are based on GDP growth in the country slowing down to less than 1 per cent in the fiscal. This decline would push industry volumes back by a decade to around 2.15 million units, a level last seen in FY11. This would be the second straight fiscal that vehicle sales would have tumbled in double digits. In FY20, sales declined by over 17 per cent to around 2.77 million units.

SIAM simulated the number for two other scenarios projecting GDP growth at a more optimistic 4 and 3 per cent depending on the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the overall economy. In the most optimistic case of a 4 per cent GDP growth, vehicle sales would decline by 10-12 per cent while in case of a 3 per cent GDP growth, it would decline by 13-16 per cent.

At the start of the year in January 2020, without the shadow of the pandemic, SIAM had internally projected a 2-4 per cent growth for the industry in fiscal 2021. With the lockdown that has completely stalled industrial activity in the country, any growth this year is now a foregone conclusion.

""These are still hypothetical numbers, more like a theoretical exercise. But the chances of the situation being much better than what is being said is far less than they being much worse. We are at the dark end of the tunnel when we cannot even say whether we are at the bottom yet,"" said an industry executive.

The other segments of the $120 billion industry are likely to fare even worse. In case of a less than 1 per cent GDP growth, the decline in commercial vehicle sales is projected at 32-25 per cent, two-wheelers at 27-30 per cent and three-wheelers at 28 per cent. Overall industry volumes would decline by over 20 per cent.

In case of a 4 per cent GDP growth, the decline would be 17-20 per cent for commercial vehicles, 16-18 per cent for two-wheelers and 18 per cent for three-wheelers. Overall volume contraction would be 13 per cent.

Sale of automobiles in the country generally follows the overall trend of GDP growth but does deviate at times. The just concluded FY20 was an example of that. While GDP growth for the fiscal was estimated at 5 per cent, overall automobile industry declined by over 16 per cent.

In August, more companies will report their results which are expected to be weaker than expected. At that time, if Nifty has crossed levels of 11,300-11,500, there could be a significant correction, which is fundamentally due,"" Sumit Bilgaiyan, Founder of Equity99 said in an interview to Moneycontrol's Sunil Shankar Matkar.

Edited excerpt:

Q: Market remained volatile in last two weeks but up move continued. Do you think the market will not look back at 10,000 again?

The market is expected to cross 11,000 soon as per technical analysis. While fundamentally the Asian markets have witnessed a sharp rebound and continue to remain strong owing to which Nifty retracting to 10,000 seems difficult. As FII inflows continue to remain strong the liquidity remains healthy and hence sharper correction without a specific event trigger on domestic/global seems unlikely and bullish trend is expected to continue from minor retracement from time to time.

In August, as more companies shall report their results which are expected to be weaker than expectation, that is when if Nifty has crossed levels of 11,300-11,500 then there could be a significant correction which is fundamentally due.

Q: Yes Bank FPO finally received 95 percent subscription with large support from QIBs. Do you think the stock price will get adjusted to near issue price of Rs 12 before listing?

There may be a minor price correction but it may not get adjusted to Rs 12 as the primary reports suggest around 27 DIIs have subscribed for the FPO which indicates these investors strong expectations of a turnaround and hence owing to these DIIs the liquidity shall remain healthy and steep correction remains unlikely. The way forward for the bank continues to see as that of dark clouds before the sunshine.

The firm has been able to raise this survival capital but COVID led challenges have deepened the woes for the bank. As the entire sector is expected to witness low growth in book size, reduction in recoveries, decline in NIIs, NIMs and increased slippages the near term outlook for Yes Bank continues to be challenging.

And a lot now depends on overall economic health rather than management's capability to steer around, albeit ones looking for a turnaround story and a multibagger kind of growth with accepting the risk of ending up with pennies on the dollar return on the downside may choose to stay invested/pour in fresh capital.

Q: Given the 79 percent subscription to Rossari Biotech, do you expect a bumper listing?

The agro chemical space is a niche one and Rossari's peers continue to trade at premium, owing to the fact that Rossari's key clientele is across FMCG, Apparel, Poultry and animal feeds industry.

In the near term, it is one of the key segments - FMCG is expected to deliver strong outperformance while Poultry and Animal feeds industry are going to remain muted while Apparel is expected to hit hard, owing to which we do not expect the firm's performance to remain rangebound in term.

This coupled with the fact that that stock is listing at a discount to its peers in terms of valuation multiple, one may choose to book profits on listing day or in a couple of days of listing and await for a better price point to enter again around Q2 results/ on any major market driven fall as we believe the firm is poised in right segments for delivering a strong growth over medium to long term.

Q: Given the current consistent up move in the market, what should be investors'/traders' strategy?

Buy on dips and sell on rise seems to be the best strategy looking at the current trend till market reaches/cross 11,300-11,500 levels, post which one needs to trade with caution with long only bets.

Q: What are your top ideas with a one year view, that can sustain its performance in every fall or remain evergreen for portfolio?

Ever since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) fired its ‘bazooka’ on March 27, the bond market has treaded an altogether reverse path. On the day, the benchmark 10-year bond yield responded, albeit lukewarmly, to the central bank’s 75 basis point policy rate cut with mere 20 basis point softening. That, no doubt, also included reaction to outright open market purchases the same day (Rs 150 billion).

Since then, term premia have climbed steadily, with the benchmark yield back to pre-75 bps cut or the March 26 value in less than a week, (6.29 percent, April 3). Till date, the reference long yield has risen 5.4 percent on its lowest, 6.09 percent, base on the day of the monetary policy review. A longer view shows this tepid response to monetary policy cues is not new, for the sovereign long bond yield has lowered about 100 basis points in response to the cumulative 210 basis points of policy rate easing over a year.

The rising risk premia reflect the spiralling of fiscal risks due to the COVID-19 shock. Markets now anticipate a larger fiscal deficit — from the extra-expenditures on health and provision of economic support as well as the revenue losses from the stoppage of economic activities. This means a steep rise in market borrowings over the planned amounts. Air is rife with speculation for nearly three weeks; the recommended corona-package sizes range from 2-5 percent of GDP to that of matching the United States. Such apprehensions have built market perceptions, pushing up term premia, triggering thereon the strong advocacy that the adverse turn in beliefs be resolved through primary market issue purchases by the central bank.

The churn spilled over to a humongous jump in borrowing costs of the state governments, soon after the 75 bps policy rate easing — spreads over the 10-year sovereign bond yield rose to 140-160 basis points on April 7 auction, easing somewhat this week (117 basis points, April 13) but still much higher than the historical average spreads.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Markets have not spared the central government either, which faced higher costs — 6.51 percent weighted average yield on 10-year benchmark — at the auction last week. It is unclear why the RBI did not perform open market operations (OMOs) in response to these developments. However, it’s noteworthy that the rise in risk premia in April’s first fortnight follows three consecutive OMO purchases in the last week of March (Rs 411.4 billion on March 23-27).

Such high borrowing costs are simply unsustainable, given the existing debts and deficits of both central and state governments, and the adverse turn in the growth outlook. It is also undermining monetary easing and other efforts aimed at a downward trajectory in interest rates to help the economy.

The fiscal position was already too tight with not a centimetre to spare this February. Then, the government used the legally-permitted ‘escape clause’ to offset two years of successive revenue decline. As budgeted balances are set aside by the unanticipated health and economic catastrophe, the fiscal position is now set to burst open at the seams.

However, the need for policy support — monetary and fiscal — is unquestionable. Indeed, it is fiscal policy that has to bear the weight of policy response in this crisis — to support lost incomes, prevent bankruptcies, especially at the most vulnerable segments.

However, the government has not so far revealed its mind about any such additional expenditure towards the twin health and economic crises; nor has it indicated more borrowings than budgeted for the year. An economic task force was set up at the launch of the lockdown on March 24, but its views are still not known. However, the speculative build-up in the bond market, the resulting negation of monetary policy is counterproductive.

This needs urgent redress by the government that has maintained an unusual silence on its fiscal plans. Even if it is waiting to get a better handle on COVID-19’s negative economic effects — this is understandably not easy, given the enormous uncertainty about the pandemic’s evolution — there is a need to break or confront the rising interest rate environment with some clarity on expected extra-expenditure and its financing. A coarse ballpark figure of this year’s anticipated deficit and a fair idea about how the crisis-expenditures will be reversed in the next few years (i.e. credible medium-term consolidation plan) is crucial to address market fears, dispel confusion about fiscal evolution and financing, and establish market confidence to pave a softer interest rate path. Monetary policy cannot accomplish this alone.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/oil-steadies-as-saudi-tensions-balance-demand-outlook-3049381.html,"Oil prices steadied, supported by geopolitical tension over the disappearance of a Saudi journalist that has stoked worries about supplies from Riyadh, but weighed by concern over long-term demand outlook.

Brent crude futures for December delivery rose 35 cents to settle at $80.78 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 44 cents to settle at $71.78 a barrel.

Last week, both contracts fell by more than 4 percent as U.S. stock markets tumbled.

However, rising geopolitical tension between the United States, the world's top oil consumer, and Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest crude producers, supported prices on Monday.

Riyadh has been under pressure since journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom and a U.S. resident, disappeared on Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened ""severe punishment"" if it is found that Khashoggi was killed in the consulate.

Saudi Arabia said it would retaliate for any action against it over the Khashoggi case, state news agency SPA reported on Sunday, quoting an official source. This comes at a critical time for global oil markets, which are bracing for U.S. sanctions against Iran due to come into force on Nov. 4.

The United States is still aiming to cut Iran's oil sales to zero, Washington's special envoy for Iran said on Monday.

Turkey and Italy are the last buyers of Iranian crude outside China, India and the Middle East, according to tanker data and an industry source, the latest sign that shipments are taking a major hit from the looming sanctions.

Some producers are aiming to boost production amid the falling Iranian exports, with Iraq planning to increase oil exports from its southern ports to 4 millions barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter of 2019.

""If the Saudis don't come to the rescue when the Iranian sanctions kick in ... it's going to be a very undersupplied market. That was the fear that was initially driving prices higher,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.

However, some risk premium was taken out of the market when Trump on Monday raised the possibility that ""rogue killers"" could have been responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance.

Exerting downward pressure on prices, Friday's monthly report from the International Energy Agency said the market looked ""adequately supplied for now"" and cut its forecasts for world oil demand growth this year and next.

The secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last week said that the group saw the oil market as well supplied and that it was wary of creating a glut next year.

Market participants also focused on a weakening gasoline crack spread. Gasoline's premium to WTI sank to $9.49, the weakest since February 2017.

""We are continuing to emphasize a virtual collapse in the NYMEX gasoline crack spreads as a bearish consideration to the crude markets that provided a significant offset to the weekend Saudi headlines in today's trade,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.","oil prices steadied on Monday, supported by geopolitical tensions. tensions over the disappearance of journalist jamal Khashoggi stoked worries. but oil prices were also weighed by concerns over long-term demand outlook. u.s. stock markets tumbled last week, but oil prices remained steady. a u.s.-saudi trade war has sparked concern over supply.",Negative
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/last-british-governor-says-hong-kong-betrayed-by-china-5308061.html,"The last British governor of Hong Kong said China has betrayed the semi-autonomous territory by tightening control over the city it had promised could keep freedoms not found on the mainland. “What we are seeing is a new Chinese dictatorship,” Chris Patten told an interview with The Times of London.

“I think the Hong Kong people have been betrayed by China, which has proved once again that you can't trust it further than you can throw it.”

He said the British government “should make it clear that what we are seeing is a complete destruction of the Joint Declaration,” a legal document under which the former British colony was returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” framework.

It gives Hong Kong its own legal system and Western-style freedoms until 2047.

But many fear those are being chipped away after authorities clamped down on massive pro-democracy protests that rocked the city last year.

Last week, Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers sharply criticized China's move to enact national security legislation in the territory, which was submitted on the opening day of China's national legislative session.

It would forbid secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference and terrorism.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the move “a death knell for the high degree of autonomy” that Beijing had promised Hong Kong.

Patten told Times he believed that “one country, two systems,” the treaty logged at the United Nations, would be enough to protect Hong Kong's capitalist economy and its way of life.

“China cheats, it tries to screw things in its own favor, and if you ever point this out their 'wolf warrior' diplomats try to bully and hector you into submission,"" he said.

“It's got to stop otherwise the world is going to be a much less safe place and liberal democracy around the world is going to be destabilized.”

He called on Britain to do more to stand up to China and protect Hong Kong under its legal obligations.

“Britain has a moral, economic and legal duty to stand up for Hong Kong,” he said.

“The real danger is that we are entirely limp on this. We have obligations because we signed the agreement … If we don't have any responsibilities for the people of Hong Kong and their way of life, who do we have responsibility for?” China has criticized Patten's comments before.

https://www.financialexpress.com/entertainment/taapsee-pannu-huma-qureshi-and-other-stars-complain-of-insane-rise-in-electricity-bill/2007712/,"Actor Taapsee Pannu, Huma Qureshi and director Bijoy Nambiar are among several people from Bollywood to express concerns over the unexpected rise in their electricity bills during the lockdown.

Taking to Twitter, Taapsee shared screenshots of her electricity bill from April to June and tagged power supplier Adani Electricity.

The “Thappad” star said she her bill amount for April and May ranged between Rs 3,000-4000 but she was charged Rs 36,000 for the current month.

“Three months of lockdown and I wonder what appliance(s) I have newly used or bought in the apartment only last month to have such an insane rise in my electricity bill. @Adani_Elec_Mum what kind of power are you charging us for?” she wrote on Twitter with the screenshot of her electricity bills for three months.

In a subsequent tweet, the 32-year-old actor said she received a bill of Rs 8,640 for an apartment which isn’t in use.

“And this one is for an apartment where no one stays and it’s only visited once in a week for cleaning purpose @Adani_Elec_Mum. I am now worried if someone is actually using the apartment without our knowledge and you have helped us uncover the reality,” the actor wrote sarcastically.

In a statement, Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) said they had verified the meter reading of Taapsee and found it to be correct.

“Upon receipt of the complaint, we have verified the meter reading and found to be correct,” a spokesperson from AEML said.

Replying to Taapsee’s tweet, actor Pulkit Samrat said his bill was Rs 30,000.

Actor Renuka Shahane too shared her bills on Twitter, writing that she was charged Rs 5,510 for May but was billed unexpectedly higher in June by Adani Electricity.

“Dear @Adani_Elec_Mum I got a bill of Rs5,510/= on the 9th of May while in June I got a bill of Rs 29,700 combining May and June where you’ve charged me Rs 18,080 for the month of May. How did Rs 5,510/= become Rs 18,080/?”

Qureshi said she too was puzzled that her bill jumped to Rs 50,000 when it was Rs 6,000 last month.

“What are these new electricity rates? @Adani_Elec_Mum Last month I paid 6k .. and this month 50K?! What is this new price surge? Kindly enlighten us.”

Nambiar said he was frustrated with the inflated bill which he received for the current month.

“I am just joining the bandwagon to vent my frustration against @Adani_Elec_Mum. Without a single new appliance being bought & barely using air conditioning – my bill for this month has tripled!” the “David” director tweeted.

Quoting actor-comedian Vir Das’s tweet, where he asked if anyone else in Mumbai got an electricity bill that is triple of what they usually pay, celebrities including, Neha Dhupia, Dino Morea and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub replied they are experiencing surge in bills.

Filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan said it’s “ridiculous” that despite so many complaints, Adani Electricity hadn’t issued even a “correction.”

“So many people talking about the absolutely ridiculous electricity bill inflation by @Adani_Elec_Mum! And yet no correction or apology! Meter reading can’t be an excuse for this broad daylight robbery at a time when most people don’t have sources of income! Horrible,” the “Masaan” director wrote.

When contacted, a spokesperson from AEML said the team has re-started physical meter reading which was halted in March because of COVID-19.

“Bills were generated on lower side being an average of preceding three months, that is December, January and February, which are winter months.

“Actual consumption in the months of April, May and June is comparatively higher due to seasonal impact (summer) and increased usage (advent of Lockdown/WfH),” the statement read.

AEML said the consumers will now start receiving bills based on their consumption with “appropriate tariff slab benefits.”

“The bill amount for the past period shall be accounted as per Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) guidelines,” the statement added.","adani electricity has confirmed the meter reading of the actor is correct. actor Taapsee pannu shared screenshots of her electricity bills for three months. the 32-year-old actor said she received a bill of Rs 8,640 for an apartment which isn't in use. he said he is now worried if someone is actually using the apartment without our knowledge.",Negative

Since the US invasion Iraq has not seen the peace, progress or democracy it had hoped for. On the contrary, during the past three decades, it has become a hotbed of extremism, terrorism and resultant violence with a vast array of non-state actors, militias and proxies becoming a way of life. More so since the onset of ISIS (Daesh) and the war against it brought in a free for all under the garb of fight against terrorism. Iraqis continued to suffer the brunt. US military intervention of 2003 was perhaps the biggest folly that has destabilised the region and the world.

One of the far-reaching and unintended consequences was that the US handed over Iraq on a platter to Iran. Now it is trying to decimate Iranian influence and its militias in Iraq and is being hit in the bargain as well even if Iran and its revolutionary guards and Islamic militias fought the ISIS on the same side as the USA and others. But in January in the wake of increasing US-Iran tensions in the Persian Gulf, US drones killed the Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi Commander Abu Mahdi Al Muhandis when apparently he was going to visit the Iraqi Prime Minister who claimed that he was trying to work on a rapprochement between US and Iran. This caused a violent furore not only in Iran but also in Iraq who simply due to domestic political expediency could not let it pass. Iran extracted a calibrated revenge through missile attacks on US camps without exacerbating the ground situation. Iraq felt humiliated as its sovereignty was so blatantly violated. Hence the calls and protests against the presence of 5200 US forces on Iraqi soil became louder. Iraqi Parliament passed a resolution demanding their expulsion. Nothing would have pleased the Iranians more as they felt that the US should not have been there and in the region in the first place. Trump in his signature style threatened with more crippling sanctions.

Iraq has been facing economic turmoil due to low oil revenues and then under the clutches of COVID 19 when demand contraction for the hydrocarbons has multiplied the woes of the people. For months Iraqis have been protesting against the Government for its failure to provide employment, contain the high inflation and declining economic opportunity and growth. This was further compounded as the Prime Ministers had to resign and it became increasingly difficult to get a consensus candidate who could pass the muster of the complicated ethnoreligious constitutional provisions and competing political interests. Finally, last month former pro-US intelligence Chief Mustafa Khademi was able to form the government facing key challenges of public ire due to economic downturn and prevailing venom against the American forces. His premiership seems to have begun on a positive note as demonstrations have subsided and the dialogue with the Americans has begun at lease symbolically pleasing the Iraqis and Iranians alike.

On June 11 a virtual strategic dialogue, in accordance with the 2008 Framework Agreement, was held between the Senior Undersecretary Hashem Mostafa of Iraqi foreign Ministry and David Hale, US Under Secretary of Political affairs. The US announced that its forces had come back to Iraq in 2014 to fight against Daesh and as that threat has subsided they will be reducing their troops in Iraq. They reiterated that the US does not seek nor request permanent bases or a permanent military presence in Iraq. Although no timelines or numbers were made public the declared intent may assuage the public discontent and may provide an additional window of comfort to Khademi. In view of the upcoming US elections, it also fits in well with President Trump’s claims that he would withdraw US troops from abroad and unnecessary theatres of conflict. They are already doing so from Afghanistan and Germany and Saudi Arabia. How the US will continue to leverage its clout and influence when it wishes to take a targeted lead in the Indo-Pacific control and outreach especially against China’s growing ambitions remains to be seen. In Iraq how it visualises its security partnership will be closely watched. Meanwhile, Iraq has reiterated its commitment to protecting the military personnel of the International Coalition and the Iraqi facilities hosting them consistent with international law and specific arrangements for their presence as decided by the two countries. The other coalition partners will also have to make a call on their continued military presence.

Acknowledging fragile economic condition and need for fundamental reforms the US offered to depute economic advisers who could help Iraq tailor its funding requests to international financial institutions. Apart from its own bilateral assistance efforts will be made to attract major US companies in energy and hydrocarbons subject to favourable conditions. One of the key discussions was the US to return important political archives including artefacts and Baath Party archives to the Government of Iraq. Hopefully, these will provide the new governments and researchers a more objective and transparent analysis of the course of events in a country that could boast of being a powerful secular nation in the Middle East in the past.

To achieve security, stability and prosperity appear finally to be the key objectives even though analysts will take it with a pinch of salt. The US surely had made moderation in its approach towards Iraq especially with the new Prime Minister and will discuss these further at the Strategic Dialogue Higher Coordination Committee meeting in Washington DC. After Khademi took over the US has also extended a waiver from American sanctions till September this year allowing Iraq to import gas from Iran. Khademi happens to be the first Iraqi PM to have been invited for the official visit but obviously he will have to tread carefully between domestic expectations and US aspirations.

https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/how-oneplus-toppled-apples-iphone-from-top-premium-smartphone-slot-in-india/1456698/,"Earlier this month, Apple made a rather unusual move by cutting its quarterly sales forecast — a first in over 15 years — citing slow iPhone sales in China. India, too, is becoming a difficult market for the technology major to crack. There was a 30-35% decline in Apple’s shipments in India last year on an annualised basis, after it revamped its distribution strategy, and cut down on discounting and differential pricing across channels.

“Till the first half of 2017, Apple was trying to chase volumes with discounted prices, and driving affordability with the older models. In fact, at one point, Apple was selling iPhones for as low as `20,000-25,000,” notes Navkendar Singh, associate research director, client devices and IPDS, IDC India. The company has now consciously decided to go for value over volumes, to avoid the old lower-priced iPhone models from affecting the brand’s positioning.

Higher pricing of new models in India — the iPhoneX costs around `1 lakh in India — the weakening rupee and high import duties have further added to Apple’s woes. Globally, however, pricing is not much of an issue and the market is driven by telcos, with Samsung selling at around the same price as Apple. Singh says what ails Apple in markets like China is its lack of innovation to excite consumers, vis-à-vis other players.

One-upped by OnePlus

In India, almost 80% of the market is ruled by phones that cost around `8,000-12,000 (less than $200). According to IDC India data, Apple had around 2.5% of the market share in 2017, whereas till September 2018, its share reduced further to less than 1.5%.

Experts say the emergence of OnePlus has changed the dynamics of the premium smartphone segment in India. Its strategy to launch two flagship models each year with top-notch specifications has made high-end consumers (those willing to spend `40,000 and upwards) do a double take. While OnePlus mainly competes with Samsung and Huawei, it is also jeopardising the sales of old iPhone models, a worrying factor for Apple in India. Furthermore, OnePlus has been able to build a brand, drive volumes and increase price points of its phones by at least `3,500 with every new launch.

Analysts believe that only Apple is to blame for its troubles. Because of the high pricing, most customers are holding on to their iPhones longer, unwilling to upgrade.

On the flip side, Apple’s new distribution strategy and channel pricing could prove to be a game changer in the long run. “Apple has implemented channel discipline and price discipline, and tied up with fewer retailers. It wants consumers to experience the brand ecosystem. The focus is on services such as Apple Care,” says Tarun Pathak, associate director, Counterpoint Research.

What’s in store

Globally, Apple has stopped sharing volume numbers, instead focussing on value numbers, on services and content — Apple TV, iTunes and app store revenue. However, the India market is different and may not be ready for Apple services yet.

“Apple is a strong and aspirational brand in India. The decline in shipments has given it an opportunity to look into older generation iPhones in a strategic way. How it deals with pricing will be crucial,” Pathak opines. “Also, manufacturing in India can help Apple effectively save 10-15%, which can be passed onto customers.” Furthermore, tapping resellers who can help iPhones reach the tier III and IV markets could prove pivotal.",there was a 30-35% decline in apple’s shipments in india last year. the company has now consciously decided to go for value over volumes. the weakening rupee and high import duties have further added to Apple’s woes.

https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/iphone-12-pros-special-stealth-version-launched-with-no-cameras-at-all/story/423655.html,"iPhone 12 Pro has been reimagined in the most unusual way possible. Caviar, the Russia-based smartphone designing company, has introduced the iPhone 12 Pro Stealth that comes with everything but the cameras. The company has covered the cameras on the back and disabled the one on the front of the iPhone 12 Pro to ensure foolproof privacy on the Apple device. Privacy is crucially important today, which is why companies offer their users several controls to manage it but one can never be sure enough. Having no cameras essentially gives you that sense.

The chatter around user privacy has caused huge losses to big tech companies, after which they became extremely wary of including solutions to let their users manage privacy. Some of these solutions are camera shutters on laptops, microphone toggles on smart speakers, and tight permission settings on mobile operating systems (Android and iOS). But Caviar's iPhone 12 Pro Stealth goes beyond these measures and gets rid of all the cameras. The cameras are still there on the iPhone 12 Pro, they have just been covered with Caviar's premium, hardened titanium shield.

There are two variants of the iPhone 12 Pro Stealth. One comes with the hardened titanium with vertical guilloche on black laser coating while the other one has a PVD gold coating on the hardened titanium called Gold Version. The two models come in extremely limited quantity and will be available in select markets. Caviar says the iPhone 12 Pro Stealth starts at $4,990, which is monstrously pricier than the regular iPhone 12 Pro. Apple sells the iPhone 12 Pro in the US starting at $1,099. In India, the iPhone 12 Pro is priced at Rs 1,19,900 for the base version.

Caviar says that this non-camera version of the iPhone 12 Pro is for people who want a high level of security. These people could be those working for intelligence firms or somewhere where there is a very high risk of information leakage or infiltration. The iPhone 12 Pro's rear cameras do not show on the outside while the FaceTime camera on it has been disabled by Caviar, except for the infrared camera that is used for Face ID. Rest of the phone is as-is. This also means that the camera app on the phone will show black visuals.

If you think a smartphone without cameras is unusual (or weird), then you should know about some such innovations made by companies like BlackBerry and Nokia. BlackBerry launched the BlackBerry Classic in 2015 without any cameras to ensure its customers get the maximum level of privacy. The regular BlackBerry Classic packed an 8MP rear camera and a 2MP front camera. BlackBerry was known for creating an extremely secure ecosystem on its QWERTY phones and later touchscreen ones.

A similar phone was introduced by Nokia. The Finnish company launched the Nokia E51 without any cameras. The regular unadulterated model of the Nokia E51 packed a 2MP camera on the back while there was none on the front. This phone was manufactured in limited quantities and was available in extremely select markets.

The iPhone 12 Pro comes with a triple camera setup on the back, which brings huge improvements over the last year's iPhone 11 Pro, including support for Dolby Vision HDR video recording.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/covid-19-impact-oyo-to-lay-off-majority-of-furloughed-us-employees-report-5459021.html,"With the global travel industry battered by the coronavirus outbreak, Oyo is reportedly laying off most of its furloughed US employees as it looks to shore up operations in a market beset with low occupancy levels and dwindling revenues.

According to a report in Skift, the company, which has a presence in over 800 cities across the world, has been forced to take this step because it does not see a recovery in its global operations until the second half of 2021.

Oyo, however, will give them stock options but there are doubts about its long-term value.

The furloughed employees were informed about this development by Chief Operating Officer Abhinav Sinha.

In the mail addressed to the employees, Sinha said that in addition to the stock options, Oyo will also provide them with a job-placement service and extended health care and other separation support.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show
