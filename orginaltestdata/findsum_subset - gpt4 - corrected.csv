0,"million from the issuance of 4,419,641 shares of its common stock to third parties to allow gaea to continue to advance its investment strategy . we retained a 23.2 % ownership interest in gaea following the transaction . at december 31 , 2020 we own approximately 23.0 % of gaea and is no longer consolidated in our financial statements . we elected to be taxed as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december 31 , 2014. our qualification as a reit depends upon our ability to meet , on a continuing basis , various complex requirements under the code relating to , among other things , the sources of our gross income , the composition and values of our assets , our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our capital stock . we believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a reit under the code , and that our current intended manner of operation enables us to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes . our portfolio the following table outlines the carrying value of our portfolio of mortgage loan assets and single-family and smaller commercial properties as of december 31 , 2020 and december 31 , 2019 ( $ in millions ) : replace_table_token_4_th we closely monitor the status of our mortgage loans and , through our servicer , work with our borrowers to improve their payment records . market trends and outlook covid-19 the covid-19 pandemic that began during the first quarter of 2020 created a global public-health crisis that resulted in widespread volatility and deteriorations in household , business , and economic market conditions , including in the united states , where we conduct all of our business . during 2020 many governmental and nongovernmental authorities directed their actions toward curtailing household and business activity in order to contain or mitigate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and deployed fiscal- and monetary-policy measures in order to seek to partially mitigate the adverse effects . these programs have had varying degrees of success and the extent of the long term impact on the mortgage market remains unknown . the covid-19 pandemic began to meaningfully impact our operations in late march 2020 and this disruption was reflected in our results of operations for the quarter ended march 31 , 2020. since then many of these negative impacts have improved throughout 2020 , as follows : we recorded net recovery of credit loss provisions of $ 10.8 million on our mortgage loan portfolio and investments in beneficial interests during the year ended december 31 , 2020. we recorded total expense of $ 5.1 million for provision for anticipated credit losses on our mortgage loan portfolio and investments in beneficial interests during the three months ended march 31 , 2020 , as a result of expectations of extended portfolio durations and longer foreclosure and eviction timelines . however , during the remainder of 2020 we recovered $ 15.9 million in credit loss provisions on 47 these portfolios which was as a result of better than expected loan performance and the related positive impact on future repayments . we recorded a net $ 0.9 million of unrealized losses on our investments in debt securities to other comprehensive income during the year ended december 31 , 2020. we recorded $ 28.4 million in unrealized losses on our investments in debt securities to other comprehensive income for the three months ended march 31 , 2020. however , during the remainder of 2020 we recovered $ 27.5 million of those unrealized losses . during the course of the year , we settled net margin calls in the amount of $ 0.5 million with our repurchase financing counterparties during the year ended december 31 , 2020. for the three months ended march 31 , 2020 we settled $ 28.2 million of net margins calls with our repurchase financing counterparties due to the extreme disruption in the residential mortgage securities market from the covid-19 pandemic , and since then have recovered $ 27.7 million of cash deposits on a net basis from our repurchase financing counterparties as collateral prices rebounded off the march 31 , 2020 levels . the pandemic has continued and continues to significantly and adversely impact certain areas of the united states . as a result , our forecast of macroeconomic conditions and expected lifetime credit losses on our mortgage loan and beneficial interest portfolios is subject to meaningful uncertainty . while substantially all of our borrowers continue to make scheduled payments and we continue to receive payments in full , we have acted swiftly to support our borrowers with a mortgage forbearance program . while we generally do not hold loans guaranteed by gses or the us government , we , through our servicer , are nonetheless offering a forbearance program under terms similar to those required for gse loans . borrowers that are able to provide documentation of a negative impact of covid-19 are entitled to three months of forbearance . the three monthly payments may then be repaid over 12 months . if a borrower can not repay the deferred amount , our servicer will work with them on repayment options . notwithstanding the foregoing , to the extent special rules apply to a mortgagor because of the jurisdiction or type of the mortgage loan , the servicer will comply with those rules . our servicer has extensive experience dealing with delinquent borrowers and we believe it is well positioned to react on our behalf to any increase in mortgage delinquencies . story_separator_special_tag conversely , decreases in interest rates , in general , may over time cause : ( a ) prepayments on our mortgage loan and mbs portfolio to increase , thereby accelerating the accretion of our purchase discounts ; ( b ) the value of our mortgage loan and mbs portfolio to increase ; ( c ) coupons on our arm and hybrid arm mortgage loans and mbs to reset , although on a delayed basis , to lower interest rates ; ( d ) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease ; and ( e ) to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy , the value of these agreements to decrease . we currently expect the pace of loan prepayments to slow due to the covid-19 outbreak . market conditions . due to the dramatic repricing of real estate assets that occurred during the 2008 financial crisis and the continuing uncertainty regarding the direction and strength of the real estate markets including as a result of the pandemic , we believe a void in the debt and equity capital available for investing in real estate exists as many financial institutions , insurance companies , finance companies and fund managers have determined to reduce or discontinue investment in debt or equity related to real estate . we believe the dislocations in the residential real estate market have resulted or will result in an â€œ over-correction â€ in the repricing of real estate assets , creating a potential opportunity for us to capitalize on these market dislocations and capital void to the extent we are able to obtain financing for additional purchases . we believe that in spite of the continuing uncertain market environment for mortgage-related assets , including as a result of the pandemic outbreak , current market conditions offer potentially attractive investment opportunities for us , even in the face of a riskier and more volatile market environment . we expect that market conditions will continue to impact our operating results and will cause us to adjust our investment and financing strategies over time as new opportunities emerge and risk profiles of our business change . covid-19 pandemic . the pandemic has also impacted , and is likely to continue to impact , directly or indirectly , many of the other factors discussed above , as well as other aspects of our business . new developments continue to emerge and it is not possible for us to predict with certainty which factors will impact our business . in addition , we can not assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor , or combination of factors , may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements . in particular , it is difficult to fully assess the impact of the pandemic at this time due to , among other things , uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the outbreak domestically and internationally and the effectiveness of federal , state and local government efforts to contain the spread of covid-19 , the effects of those efforts on our business , the indirect impact on the u.s. economy and economic activity and the impact on the mortgage markets and capital markets . critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our critical accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . actual results could differ from those estimates . we consider significant estimates to include expected cash flows from mortgage loans and fair value measurements . we believe that all of the decisions 51 and assessments upon which our consolidated financial statements are and will be based were or will be reasonable at the time made based upon information available to us at that time . we have identified our most critical accounting policies to be the accounting policies associated with our mortgage-related assets and our borrowings . mortgage loans purchased credit deteriorated loans ( `` pcd loans `` ) â€” as of their acquisition date , the loans we acquired have generally suffered some credit deterioration subsequent to origination . as a result , prior to the adoption of asu 2016-13 , financial instruments - credit losses , otherwise known as cecl , on january 1 , 2020 , we were required to account for the mortgage loans pursuant to asc 310-30 , accounting for loans with deterioration in credit quality . under both standards , our recognition of interest income for pcd loans is based upon our having a reasonable expectation of the amount and timing of the cash flows expected to be collected . when the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected are reasonably estimable , we use expected cash flows to apply the effective interest method of income recognition . under both cecl and asc 310-30 , acquired loans may be aggregated and accounted for as a pool of loans if the loans have common risk characteristics . a pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows . however , cecl allows more flexibility to us to adjust its loan pools as the underlying risk factors change over time . under asc 310-30 , rpls were determined by us to have common risk characteristics and were accounted for as a single loan pool for loans acquired within each three-month calendar quarter . similarly , npls were determined to have common risk characteristics and were accounted for as a single non-performing pool for loans acquired within each three-month calendar quarter . the result was generally two additional pools ( rpls and npls ) each quarter . under cecl , we have re-aggregated our loan pools around similar risk
","a company raised million by issuing 4,419,641 shares of common stock, retaining a 23.2% ownership interest in Gaea, which was no longer consolidated in its financial statements as of December 31, 2020. The company has been taxed as a REIT since the taxable year ending December 31, 2014, and believes it meets the necessary requirements for this status. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of its mortgage loan assets and properties was monitored closely, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which began affecting operations in March 2020. The company recorded a net recovery of $10.8 million in credit loss provisions for the year, following a $5.1 million expense in Q1 2020. By year-end, it had recovered $15.9 million in credit loss provisions due to better-than-expected loan performance. Unrealized losses on debt securities were $0.9 million for the year, down from $28.4 million in Q1 2020, with a recovery of $27.5 million later. The company settled $0.5 million in net margin calls for the year, recovering $27.7 million from counterparties after initial disruptions. Despite ongoing uncertainties, the company is offering a mortgage forbearance program for borrowers affected by COVID-19, allowing three months of forbearance to be repaid over 12 months. The pandemic has created a void in real estate investment capital, presenting potential opportunities for the company to capitalize on market dislocations. However, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the mortgage market remains uncertain, and the company continues to adapt its investment strategies in response to evolving market conditions."
1,"we continue to be optimistic about our growth prospects in europe , particularly in the united kingdom , germany and scandinavian countries , where the push for higher energy efficiency standards has been the strongest . older technology cold-edge spacers are still a dominant force in these regions and garner a larger portion of the total market share in europe relative to the united states . we operate warm-edge spacer plants in the united kingdom and in germany , where we added a third production line during the fourth quarter of 2013. we have experienced some challenges in europe associated with product defects , which have been alleviated with the implementation of a replacement component for our warm-edge spacer products during 2014. we believe we can become the provider of choice as demand for more energy-efficient warm edge spacers grows and eventually displaces cold edge spacers . the housing recovery continues to improve in the united states , but there remain challenges to growth prospects in the fenestration market that we serve . we have experienced an increase in demand for our products in europe , australia and scandinavia , but slow recovery in canada . in the united states , our growth is somewhat dependent upon the growth of our customers , particularly the national oems . if these customers lose market share or exert pricing pressure on us , our business may be negatively impacted . furthermore , our growth can be impeded by the availability and pricing of critical raw materials , and our ability to pass this incremental cost to our customers through surcharges . finally , our business is subject to seasonality , as window installation levels generally increase during the summer months and decrease during the winter months due to inclement weather . 24 comparison of the fiscal years ended october 31 , 2014 and 2013 this table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the twelve-month periods ended october 31 , 2014 and 2013. replace_table_token_6_th net sales . net sales increased $ 40.5 million , or 7 % , for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. the results for 2014 include incremental sales of $ 12.7 million associated with the alumco business acquired in december 2012 , reflecting a full year of activity in 2014 versus ten months of activity in 2013 , as well as the effect of price increases during the latter half of 2014 and higher volume . we experienced higher sales volume for our insulating glass spacer products , including strong core united states sales , increased export sales , better-than-expected results for our solar product line , and favorable sales associated with the european operations , despite some challenges with customer returns and allowances in europe . in addition , our window screen accessory products were in higher demand in 2014 resulting in favorable pricing , primarily for our wood products . our vinyl profile product sales were favorably impacted by the volume associated with the greenville asset acquisition in december 2013 , as well as an increase from resin surcharges for a portion of our vinyl profiles as resin prices increased throughout 2014. our vinyl profile product sales were unfavorably impacted by price concessions , contractual provisions in annual contracts that limit the amount of increased vinyl resin cost we can pass to customers , other pricing pressure and an increase in sales returns and allowances . overall improvement in the housing market in the united states is trending toward new construction of multi-family homes which generally contain lower-cost , less energy-efficient windows . window shipments , derived from preliminary data provided by ducker for the year-over-year twelve-month periods ended september 30 , 2014 and 2013 , reflect an overall growth rate of 5.3 % compared to a growth rate of 5.4 % for our year-over-year results during the same period , as adjusted for certain foreign and other results , including pro forma results for alumco , to be more comparable to ducker . cost of sales . the increase in cost of sales of $ 44.9 million , or 11 % , for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 correlates to a 7 % increase in net sales , as described above . the primary reason for the decrease in margin during 2014 was related to a series of resin cost increases , a major raw material used in our vinyl products . we also experienced labor inefficiencies partially attributable to delays associated with new extrusion lines , higher repair and maintenance costs , and freight costs . these increases in cost were partially offset by favorable material price variances for butyl , a commodity used for our ig spacer products , as well as other material savings . we recorded a decrease in warranty accruals of $ 3.0 million , of which $ 2.9 million related to a warranty accrual for a specific customer which was settled in december 2013. furthermore , we continue to evaluate our cost structure to reduce overhead and align our staffing needs to maximize efficiency . selling , general and administrative . our selling , general and administrative expenses decreased $ 16.9 million , or 17 % , for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. of this amount , $ 9.9 million represents the cost incurred in 2013 associated with our erp implementation project which was ceased in august 2013. no such implementation costs were incurred for the comparative period in 2014. in addition , we reduced our headcount associated with the information technology structure that was originally built to support the erp project ; we streamlined our sales and marketing group ; and we implemented selective headcount reductions . story_separator_special_tag in addition , in april 2013 , we capitalized an office build-out associated with the new corporate offices in houston , texas . asset impairment charges . we recorded an impairment loss of $ 1.5 million during fiscal 2013. of this amount , $ 0.7 million was related to a write-down of certain land held for sale in arizona , and $ 0.8 million was related to a write-down of the facility held for sale in barbourville , kentucky , as well as certain other fixed assets . for fiscal 2012 , we recorded an impairment loss of $ 0.9 million associated with our facility in barbourville , kentucky . income ( loss ) from discontinued operations . we sold nichols on april 1 , 2014. we account for this business as a discontinued operation . for the year ended october 31 , 2013 , we recorded income of $ 0.7 million related to discontinued operations , net of tax , compared to a loss of $ 10.0 million for the year ended october 31 , 2012. the loss in 2012 was largely attributable to a decrease in sales and productivity resulting from a union strike . we incurred higher third-party processing ( labor ) and material costs as we purchased semi-finished coil from outside parties to fulfill customer orders , and we did not have sufficient labor to run our casting facility at full capacity . the strike was directly related to a decline in volume processed of 12 million pounds . no such strike occurred during fiscal 2013. story_separator_special_tag to prepare for potential disruption in the money markets , we may temporarily move funds into operating bank accounts of highly-rated financial institutions to meet on-going operational liquidity requirements . we did not experience any material losses on our cash and marketable securities investments during the years ended october 31 , 2014 and 2013. we maintain cash balances in foreign countries which total $ 3 million as of october 31 , 2014. we consider these funds to be permanently reinvested in these countries . senior credit facility prior to january 28 , 2013 , we maintained a $ 270.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( the retired facility ) which had been executed on april 23 , 2008 and was scheduled to mature on april 23 , 2013. the retired facility provided for up to $ 50.0 million of standby letters of credit , limited based on availability , as defined . amounts borrowed under the facility were to bear interest at a spread above the london interbank borrowing rate ( libor ) based on a combined leverage and ratings grid . in addition , the retired facility contained restrictive debt covenants , as defined in the indenture , and contained certain limits on additional indebtedness , asset or equity sales and acquisitions . during the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2012 and for the period from november 1 , 2012 through january 28 , 2013 , we were in compliance with our debt covenants and did not borrow funds pursuant to the retired facility . we believe that we have sufficient funds and adequate financial resources available to meet our anticipated liquidity needs . we also believe our cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient in the next twelve months and foreseeable future to finance our anticipated working capital requirements , capital expenditures , debt service requirements , treasury share purchases and dividends . on january 28 , 2013 , we replaced the retired facility by entering into a new $ 150 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that has a five-year term , maturing on january 28 , 2018 , and which permits aggregate borrowings at any time of up to $ 150 million , with a letter of credit sub-facility , a swing line sub-facility and a multi-currency sub-facility . borrowings denominated in u.s dollars bear interest at a spread above libor or a base rate derived from the prime rate . foreign denominated borrowings bear interest at a spread above the libor applicable to such currencies . subject to customary conditions , we may request that the aggregate commitments under the credit facility be increased by up to $ 100 million , with total commitments not to exceed $ 250 million . the credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants , the terms of which are defined therein . specifically , we must not permit , on a quarterly basis , our ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as defined ( minimum interest coverage ratio ) , to fall below 3.00:1 or our ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda , as defined ( maximum consolidated leverage ratio ) , to exceed 3.25:1. the maximum consolidated leverage ratio is the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense , in each case for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters . ebitda is defined by the indenture to include proforma ebitda of acquisitions and to exclude certain items such as goodwill and intangible asset impairments and certain other non-cash charges and non-recurring items . subject to our compliance with the covenant requirements , the amount available under the credit facility is a function of : ( 1 ) our trailing twelve month ebitda ; ( 2 ) the minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum consolidated leverage ratio allowed under the credit facility ; and ( 3 ) the aggregate amount of our outstanding debt and letters of credit . as of october 31 , 2014 , we were in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the credit facility , as indicated in the table below : required actual minimum interest coverage ratio no less than 3.00:1 77.76:1 maximum consolidated leverage ratio no greater than 3.25:1 0.15:1 the credit facility also contains certain limitations on additional indebtedness , asset or equity sales and acquisitions . the payment of dividends and other distributions is permitted
","the company remains optimistic about growth prospects in Europe, particularly in the UK, Germany, and Scandinavian countries, where energy efficiency standards are being prioritized. Cold-edge spacers dominate the European market, unlike in the US. The company operates warm-edge spacer plants in the UK and Germany, having added a third production line in Q4 2013. In fiscal 2014, net sales increased by $40.5 million (7%) , aided by a full year of sales from the Alumco acquisition and price increases. However, challenges included product defects and rising raw material costs, particularly resin, which contributed to an 11% increase in cost of sales to $ 44.9 million. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $16.9 million (17%) due to the cessation of ERP implementation costs. The company recorded a $1.5 million impairment loss in fiscal 2013 and reported a $0.7 million income from discontinued operations in 2013, compared to a $10 million loss in 2012. The company maintains $3 million in cash balances in foreign countries and has a $150 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, with compliance to financial covenants as of October 31, 2014."

why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements , whether as a result of new information , future events or otherwise . in light of these risks , uncertainties and assumptions , the forward-looking statements discussed in this report might not occur and you should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements . additional factors that may affect our results are discussed under part i , item 1a in this document under the heading â€œ risk factors . â€ general our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public , as well as brokered deposits , and investing those funds primarily in loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied , one- to four-family residences , a variety of consumer loans , direct financing leases , commercial and industrial loans , and loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate . we also obtain funds by utilizing fhlb advances . funds not invested in loans generally are invested in investment securities , including mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities and agency and municipal bonds . our results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income . net interest income is the difference between interest income , which is the income that is earned on loans and investments , and interest expense , which is the interest that is paid on deposits and borrowings . other significant sources of pre-tax income are service charges ( mostly from service charges on deposit accounts and loan servicing fees ) , and fees from sale of residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market . we also recognize income from the sale of investment securities . 60 at december 31 , 2019 , on a consolidated basis , we had $ 986.0 million in assets , $ 687.3 million in loans , $ 617.2 million in deposits and $ 187.8 million in stockholders ' equity . first bank richmond 's risk-based capital ratio at december 31 , 2019 was 19.5 % , exceeding the 10.0 % requirement for a well-capitalized institution . for the year ended december 31 , 2019 , we reported a net loss of $ 14.1 million , compared with net income of $ 5.7 million for 2018. critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition , since they require management to make difficult , complex or subjective judgments , some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain . management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan and lease losses , the valuation of foreclosed assets , mortgage servicing rights , valuation of intangible assets and securities , deferred tax asset and income tax accounting . allowance for loan and lease losses . we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to cover probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date . loan and lease losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed . subsequent recoveries , if any , are credited to the allowance . allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans , but the entire allowance is available for any loan that , in our judgment , should be charged-off . a provision for loan and lease losses is charged to operations based on our periodic evaluation of the necessary allowance balance . we have an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses . the determination of the allowance is inherently subjective , as it requires significant estimates , including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans , estimated losses on other classified loans and pools of homogeneous loans , and consideration of past loan loss experience , the nature and volume of the portfolio , information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values , economic conditions and other factors , all of which may be susceptible to significant change . foreclosed assets . foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs . management estimates the fair value of the properties based on current appraisal information . fair value estimates are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the economic environment , market conditions , and real estate market . story_separator_special_tag the average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased 48 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018 , partially due to a 34 basis point increase in the average rate paid on brokered certificates of deposit . the rate paid on borrowings was 2.18 % in 2019 , an increase of 36 basis points over the average rate of 1.82 % in 2018. the primary reason for these increases was a higher average market rate of interest during 2019 , despite three 25 basis point decreases in the federal funds rate during the months of august , september and october . the average balance of certificates of deposit and borrowings in 2019 increased by 64 $ 23.9 million and $ 28.6 million , respectively , compared to those in 2018. the primary reason for these increases was to fund loan growth during 2019. net interest income . net interest income before provision for loan and lease losses increased $ 3.0 million , or 10.8 % , to $ 30.4 million in 2019 compared to $ 27.4 million in 2018 , primarily due to the increase in average earning assets . our net interest margin in 2019 was 3.34 % , a decrease of 23 basis points compared to 2018. the decrease in net interest margin mostly reflects slightly lower overall yield on average interest-earning assets largely as a result of three 25 basis point decreases in the targeted fed funds rate in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. provision for loan and lease losses . the provision for loan and lease losses in 2019 was $ 2.6 million , a $ 920,000 increase over the $ 1.7 million provision in 2018. the increase in the provision was due to the growth of the loan and lease portfolio during 2019 , and slightly higher net charge-offs than were experienced in 2018. net charge-offs in 2019 were $ 231,000 more than 2018. due to the increased provision expense , the allowance increased as a percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio to 1.02 % at year-end 2019. net charge-offs in 2019 equaled 0.16 % of total average loans and leases outstanding compared to 0.14 % of total average loans and leases outstanding in 2018. the increase in net charge-offs was primarily due to three moderately-sized loan charge-offs in 2019 with no similar charge-offs during 2018. non-interest income . total non-interest income decreased $ 434,000 , or 10.1 % , to 39.0 million for 2019 compared to $ 4.3 million for 2018. the decrease in total noninterest income was primarily driven by the recognition of impairment of mortgage servicing rights of $ 202,000 and a $ 510,000 decrease in other income primarily due to gains recorded on prepayment of below market rate fhlb advances recorded in 2018. these decreases were partially offset by an $ 83,000 increase in the gain on sale of securities in 2019 compared to 2018. non-interest expenses . total noninterest expense increased $ 27.9 million , or 120.8 % , to $ 51.0 million during 2019 compared to 2018. the increase primarily was the result of the $ 19.3 million estimated db plan expense , the $ 6.25 million expense attributable to the contribution to the foundation and the $ 1.7 million expense related to the adoption of a nonqualified deferred compensation plan during the year . excluding these three non-recurring expenses , noninterest expenses increased $ 700,000 in 2019 compared to 2018. salaries and employee benefits increased $ 21.2 million , or 153.6 % , in 2019 compared to 2018 , primarily due to the estimated db plan expense and expense related to the adoption of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan . excluding the cost of those two non-recurring expenses , salaries and employee benefits increased $ 300,000 , or 2.25 , due to merit increases . data processing fees increased $ 267,000 , primarily attributable to higher transaction volume and additional services utilized from the company 's it provider . fdic assessments decreased $ 329,000 , or 54.8 % , during 2019 compared to 2018. this was the result of the deposit insurance fund achieving a specified ratio of eligible deposits and banks with less than $ 10 billion assets receiving credit for previous assessments paid . legal and professional fees increased $ 133,000 , or 15.2 % , in 2019 compared to 2018 , primarily as a result of our reorganization and stock offering and operating as a public company . advertising expense increased $ 280,000 , or 51.5 % , year-over-year due to sponsorships of various community organizations and events . loan tax and insurance expense decreased by $ 274,000 , or 46.7 % , during 2019 compared to 2018 due to a recovery of $ 84,000 in property taxes during 2019 that were advanced in 2018 and lower expenses in 2019 on loans sold but still serviced by the bank . other expenses increased $ 4,259,000 , or 9.0 % , in 2019 compared to 2018 , primarily driven by a $ 62,000 increase in loan closing expenses and a $ 46,000 increase in charitable contributions . income tax expense . income tax expense decreased in 2019 by $ 6.6 million compared to 2018 , reflecting a tax benefit of $ 5.3 million for 2019. this decrease in income tax expense was due to pre-tax income decreasing during 2019 compared to 2018 for the reasons discussed above . 65 average balances , interest and average yields/cost the following tables set forth for the periods indicated , information regarding average balances of assets and

For the year, the bank experienced a net loss of $14.1 million, a significant decline from the net income of $5.7 million in 2018. Net interest income increased by 10.8% to $30.4 million, driven by a rise in average earning assets, while the net interest margin decreased to 3.34%. The provision for loan and lease losses rose to $2.6 million, reflecting growth in the loan portfolio and higher net charge-offs, which amounted to $231,000 more than in 2018. Non-interest income fell by 10.1% to $39.0 million, primarily due to impairment of mortgage servicing rights and decreased other income. Total non-interest expenses surged by 120.8% to $51.0 million, largely due to a $19.3 million estimated defined benefit plan expense and a $6.25 million contribution to the foundation. Income tax expense decreased by $6.6 million, resulting in a tax benefit of $5.3 million for 2019. The average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased by 48 basis points, while the rate on borrowings rose up, reflecting a higher average market interest rate despite federal funds rate cuts. Overall, the bank's financial performance was impacted by various economic, regulatory, and operational factors, including changes in consumer behavior and accounting practices."

$ 1,094 for the year ended december 31 , 2015 . deferred revenue is a key metric of our business as it indicates a level of sales already made that will be recognized as revenue in the future . deferred revenue reflects the impact of our ability to sign customers to longer term contracts . we recorded deferred revenue of $ 84.3 million at december 31 , 2015 , including $ 969,000 of slashdot media deferred revenue classified as held for sale as of december 31 , 2015 , and $ 86.4 million at december 31 , 2014 . we also generate revenue from advertising on our various websites or from lead generation and marketing solutions provided to our customers . advertisements include various forms of rich media and banner advertising , text links , sponsorships , and custom content marketing solutions . lead generation information utilizes advertising and other methods to deliver leads to a customer . our ability to continue to grow our revenues will largely depend on our ability to grow our customer bases in the markets in which we operate by acquiring new recruitment package customers and advertisers while retaining a high proportion of the customers we currently serve , and to expand the breadth of services our customers purchase from us . we continue to make investments in our business and infrastructure to help us achieve our long-term growth objectives . 32 other material factors that may affect our results of operations include our ability to attract qualified professionals that become engaged with our websites and our ability to attract customers with relevant job opportunities . the more qualified professionals that use our websites , the more attractive our websites become to employers and advertisers , which in turn makes them more likely to become our customers , resulting positively on our results of operations . if we are unable to continue to attract qualified professionals to engage with our websites , our customers may no longer find our services attractive , which could have a negative impact on our results of operations . additionally , we need to ensure that our websites remain relevant in order to attract qualified

. critical accounting policies this discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap . the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates , judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets , liabilities , revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . on an ongoing basis , we evaluate our estimates , including those related to revenue , goodwill and intangible assets , stock-based compensation and income taxes . we based our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable . in many cases , we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates . in some cases , changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period . our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements . revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists , delivery of service has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured . payments received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized generally on a straight-line basis over the service period . we generate a majority of our revenue from the sale of recruitment packages . recruitment package revenues are derived from the sale to recruiters and employers a combination of job postings and access to a searchable database of candidates on our dice , rigzone , efinancialcareers , clearancejobs , health ecareers , biospace and hcareers websites . certain of our arrangements include multiple deliverables , which consist of the ability to post jobs and access to a searchable database of candidates . we determine the units of accounting for multiple element arrangements in accordance with the multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements subtopic of the fasb asc . specifically , we consider a delivered item as a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis . our arrangements do not include a general right of return . services to customers buying a package of available job postings and access to the database are delivered over the same period and revenue is recognized ratably over the length of the underlying contract , typically from one to twelve months . the separation of the package into two deliverables results in no change in revenue recognition since delivery of the two services occurs over the same time period . revenue from the sale of classified job postings and data services is recognized ratably over the length of the contract or the period of actual usage . revenue from recruitment events is recognized when the event is held . story_separator_special_tag the corporate & other segment decreased $ 550,000 due to decreased salaries and related costs and commissions costs at workdigital of approximately $ 500,000 , delayed hiring and turnover and lower commissions at slashdot media of

this decrease in amortization expense was partially offset by an increase of $ 1.3 million due to the oilcareers acquisition , accelerated due to oilcareers ' rebranding to rigzone . impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2015 , we determined that the goodwill at the energy reporting unit was impaired . the fair value of this reporting unit was determined by a combination of a discounted cash flow methodology and market comparable method . cash flow projections for this reporting unit decreased significantly during the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the decline in demand for

5,"in addition , our reserves currently exhibit thermoplastic behavior suitable for cokemaking and contain an average of approximately 39 % -40 % volatile matter ( on a dry basis ) , which enables us , if market dynamics are favorable , to capture greater margins from selling our coal as a crossover product in the high-vol metallurgical market to cokemakers and steel manufacturers who utilize modern cokemaking technologies . on september 30 , 2016 , the partnership and its wholly owned subsidiary , cnx thermal holdings , entered into a contribution agreement ( the â€œ contribution agreement â€ ) with consol energy , cpcc and conrhein and together with cpcc , ( the â€œ contributing parties â€ ) , under which cnx thermal holdings acquired an undivided 6.25 % of the contributing parties ' right , title and interest in and to the pennsylvania mining complex ( which represents an aggregate 5 % undivided interest in and to the pennsylvania mining complex ) . the pa mining acquisition was a transaction between entities under common control ; therefore , the partnership recorded the assets and liabilities of the acquired 5 % of pennsylvania mining complex at their carrying amounts to consol energy on the date of the transaction . the difference between consol energy 's net carrying amount and the total consideration paid to consol energy was recorded as a capital transaction with consol energy , which resulted in a reduction in partners ' capital . the partnership recast its historical consolidated financial statements to retrospectively reflect the additional 5 % ( a total 25 % ) interest in pennsylvania mining complex as if the business was owned for all periods presented ; however , the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if the partnership had owned it during the periods reported . how we evaluate our operations our management team uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance . these metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability . the metrics include : ( i ) coal production , sales volumes and average sales price ; ( ii ) cost of coal sold , a non-gaap financial measure ; ( iii ) average cash margin per ton , an operating ratio derived from non-gaap financial measures , ( iv ) adjusted ebitda , a non-gaap financial measure ; and ( v ) distributable cash flow , a non-gaap financial measure . cost of coal sold , average cash margin per ton , adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow normalize the volatility contained within gaap measures , by adjusting certain non-operating or non-cash transactions . these metrics are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements , such as investors , industry analysts , lenders and ratings agencies , to assess : our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry , without regard to financing methods , historical cost basis or capital structure ; the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners ; 49 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures ; the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities ; and the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities . the non-gaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to total costs , net income , operating cash flow , or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap . these measures exclude some , but not all , items that affect net income or net cash , and these measures may vary from those of other companies . as a result , the items presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies . reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures we evaluate our cost of coal sales on a cost per ton basis . our cost of coal sold per ton represents our costs of coal sold divided by the tons of coal we sell . we define cost of coal sold as operating and other production costs related to produced tons sold , along with changes in coal inventory , both in volumes and carrying values . the cost of coal sold per ton includes items such as direct operating costs , royalty and production taxes , direct administration , and depreciation , depletion and amortization costs . our costs exclude any indirect costs such as general and administrative costs and other costs not directly attributable to the production of coal . the gaap measure most directly comparable to cost of coal sold is total costs . we define average cash margin per ton as average coal revenue per ton , net of average cost of coal sold per ton , less depreciation , depletion and amortization . we define adjusted ebitda as ( i ) net income ( loss ) before net interest expense , depreciation , depletion and amortization , as adjusted for ( ii ) certain non-cash items , such as long-term incentive awards including phantom units under the cnx coal resources lp 2015 long-term incentive plan ( `` unit based compensation `` ) . the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income . story_separator_special_tag the $ 953 increase in the year-to-year comparison was primarily due to lower capitalized interest as a result of the commencement of longwall mining operations at the harvey mine in march 2014. adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda was $ 115,964 for the year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to $ 157,340 for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . the $ 41,376 decrease was attributed to 814 less tons sold and a $ 3.72 per ton decrease in the average cash margin per ton sold . the $ 3.72 per ton decrease in the average cash margin per ton which was primarily a result of the $ 5.52 per ton coal sales price decrease offset , in part , against a $ 1.80 per ton improvement in the cash costs of coal sold , which resulted in a $ 21,275 decrease to adjusted ebitda . the remaining decrease in adjusted ebitda of $ 20,101 is primarily due to 814 less tons sold during 2015. distributable cash flow distributable cash flow was $ 54,994 for the year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to $ 86,292 for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . the $ 31,298 decrease was primarily attributed to a $ 41,376 decrease in adjusted ebitda as discussed above , offset in part , by a reduction in cash interest paid for the year ended december 31 , 2015 of $ 7,896 compared to $ 9,538 for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . the remaining variance was due to various other transactions in both periods , none of which are individually material . 58 capital resources and liquidity story_separator_special_tag style= `` font-family : inherit ;

","the partnership's coal reserves demonstrate thermoplastic behavior suitable for cokemaking, with an average of 39%-40% volatile matter on a dry basis, allowing potential higher margins in the high-vol metallurgical market. On September 30, 2016, the partnership, through its subsidiary CNX Thermal Holdings, acquired a 6.25% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania mining complex, totaling a 5% interest in the complex. The partnership recorded this acquisition at carrying amounts, resulting in a capital transaction that reduced partners' capital. Historical financial statements were recast to reflect this interest as if owned for all periods. Key performance metrics include coal production, sales volumes, average sales price, cost of coal sold, average cash margin per ton, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2015, adjusted EBITDA was $115,964, down from $157,340 in 2014, primarily due to 814 fewer tons sold and a $3.72 decrease in average cash margin per ton. Distributable cash flow also decreased to $54,994 from $86,292 in 2014, largely due to the drop in adjusted EBITDA, despite a reduction in cash interest paid. The partnership does not engage in off-balance sheet arrangements that could materially affect its financial condition. As of December 31, 2016, estimated liabilities for workers' compensation were $4,385,000 with benefit payments of $1,553,000 while coal workers' pneumoconiosis liabilities were $2,113000 with payments of $53000. The partnership also accounts for asset retirement obligations related to mine closures and land reclamation, which are significant in determining future liabilities."

","The company has strategically shifted its sales mix towards higher-margin products, particularly premium bourbon and rye whiskeys, resulting in a 10.5% increase in net sales of food-grade alcohol in 2015 compared to 2014. The ingredient solutions segment also saw a 6.3% growth in net sales of specialty wheat starches. Overall, gross profit rose by $8,023, or 56.1%, with gross margins improving from 5.4% in 2013 to 8.7% in 2014. In 2015, the ingredient solutions segment's net sales increased by $537, or 0.9%, driven by a 1.1% rise in product sales volume.

Additionally, premium bourbon and rye whiskey inventories increased by $17,164 in 2015 to meet anticipated future demand. The company also made key management changes, including the appointment of Dr. Clodualdo Maningat as VP of Ingredients R&D and Stephen J. Glaser as VP of Production and Engineering. Operating cash flow improved significantly, rising from $6,658 in 2013 to $25,409 in 2014, while net investing cash outflow for 2015 was $30,526, primarily due to capital investments related to facility expansions and equipment replacements."
7,"these initiatives may result in increased operating expenses and capital investments , which may not result in higher revenue or net income . we received ed 's approval of our hcon change-in-ownership application on january 19 , 2016 , and hcon subsequently entered into a provisional program participation agreement , which requires hcon to comply with specific conditions while provisionally certified . further information regarding the hcon acquisition and the potential risks associated with it are further addressed in the â€œ business - regulatory environment â€ and â€œ risk factors - risks related to our business â€ sections of this annual report . changing student body . although apus 's focus has broadened , it continues to have an emphasis on its relationship with military and military affiliated communities . as of december 31 , 2015 , approximately 56 % of apus 's students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment , and as a result apus is particularly reliant on dod 's tuition assistance programs and dod 's budget . since 2006 , when apus began participating in ed 's title iv financial aid programs , or title iv programs , a significant portion of apus 's growth has been attributable to students using funds from those programs and , as a result , apus experienced a change in the composition of its student body , which has resulted , and may continue to result , in a need to provide a broader array of services to its students . the hcon acquisition further changed the composition of our student body , adding students who attend classes at physical campuses , as well as additional students using title iv program funds . the change in the composition of apus 's student body has made it more difficult for us to make long-range student enrollment forecasts . we have had increased difficulty forecasting the number of students who will enroll , and have noticed a decrease in the predictability of the rate at which our institutions convert prospective students into enrolled students , which we attribute , in part , to increased competition , changes in our marketing approach , our new admissions assessment process at apus , and our recent tuition increase at apus , among other factors . if we are unable to manage changes in the composition of our institutions ' student bodies and control the growth of related expenditures , we may experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . for more information about the risks related to these challenges please see â€œ risk factors - risks related to our business . â€ increased costs and expenses ; our initiatives . our costs and expenses have increased over time due in part to increased general and administrative expenses related to the addition of hcon 's physical campuses , a changing student body , an increase in expenditures for financial aid processing , and expenditures for technology required to support students at apus . further , although bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue decreased during the year ended december 31 , 2015 , it has trended upward over time and could increase in future periods . our revenue may decline and our costs and expenses may increase as our institutions adjust to changes in their student composition , undertake initiatives to improve the learning experience , and attract students who are more likely to persist in their programs . these initiatives may include , but are not limited to , the following : further changes to admissions and graduation standards and requirements ; altering the admissions process and procedures ; revising satisfactory academic progress standards ; changing tuition costs and payment options ; transitioning student facing services , including expanded use of the clearpath system ; experimenting with competency-based learning and other alternative delivery methods ; opening new campuses and expanding programs at hcon ; and altering our institutions ' marketing programs to target the appropriate prospective students . 77 information technology systems are an essential part of the apus student experience and our business operations , and we continue to invest in technology operations and enhancements to support our systems and mission and continually evaluate whether it is appropriate to make significant changes , modifications or upgrades . these types of changes are not without risk to our operations and financial results . we continually evaluate our pad system for possible changes and upgrades , and such changes and upgrades may result in us incurring significant costs that could affect our financial results in the near term . these investments may result in an increased level of spending , not all of which can be capitalized . organizational realignment . on december 14 , 2015 , apus issued a press release announcing that it had commenced a search for a new apus president in connection with an anticipated organizational realignment . after the identification of his successor , apus president and ceo dr. wallace e. boston will focus on his position as ceo of apei , providing strategic and leadership support to apus , hcon , and other apei ventures . this transition , and the related anticipated organizational realignment , may cause strategic or operational challenges for us , the impact of which could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , and cash flows . admissions process . story_separator_special_tag since 2006 , in part because apus 's students can access ed 's title iv programs and because of an already strong position serving service members , apus has been increasing its focus on public safety professionals and other civilian markets . ed 's title iv programs require participating students to take more courses per semester than students participating in dod tuition assistance programs . as a result , should the number of apus 's students who utilize ed 's title iv programs increase ( or the number of students using dod tuition assistance programs decreases ) , we anticipate that it may cause the average number of courses per student per semester to increase . you should not rely on the results of any prior periods as an indication of future net course registrations at apus , student enrollments at hcon , or consolidated revenue . the composition of our students , changing market demands and competition , make forecasting very difficult , and we are unable to determine if we will return to growth or what level of growth we will achieve , if any . similarly , you should not rely on our operating margins in any prior periods as an indication of our future operating margins . tuition rate . providing affordable programs is an important element of our strategy for growth . as discussed above in â€œ management 's discussion and analysis - overview â€ , we estimate that apus 's tuition is lower than the average in-state rates at public universities and the july 2015 tuition increase was apus 's first undergraduate tuition increase since 2000 , and the first graduate tuition increase in four years . tuition , fees , and books at hcon are also designed to be affordable and competitive with other similar institutions offering the same level of flexibility , accessibility , and student experience . net tuition . tuition revenue varies from period to period based on the aggregate number of students attending courses and the number of courses they are attending during the period , the mix of programs that students are attending during the period , as well as the number of students starting courses each month during the period and the timing of the start of a course each month or term . tuition revenue is adjusted to reflect amounts for students who withdraw from a course in the month or term the withdrawal occurs . we also provide scholarships to certain students to assist them financially with their educational goals . the cost of these scholarships is netted against tuition revenue in the period incurred for purposes of establishing net tuition revenue . other fees . other fees at apus include charges for transcript credit evaluation , which includes assistance in securing official transcripts on behalf of the student and evaluating transcripts for transfer credit , and a technology fee per course . apus may alter fees in the future and anticipates eliminating its transfer credit evaluation fee during the second quarter of 2016 , such elimination is not expected to have a material effect on our revenue or financial condition . apus students are also charged certain additional fees , such as graduation , late registration , transcript request , and comprehensive examination fees , when applicable . apus provides a grant to cover the technology fee for certain students , including those using dod tuition assistance programs . for the year ended december 31 , 2015 , technology fee revenue was approximately $ 7.6 million , or 2.3 % of revenue . in accordance with fasb asc topic 605-50 , accounting by a customer ( including a reseller ) for certain consideration received from a vendor , other fees also include book purchase commissions that apus receives for graduate student book purchases and ancillary supply purchases that students make directly from our preferred book vendor . hcon students are charged application , enrollment , and graduation fees , when applicable . costs and expenses we categorize our costs and expenses as ( i ) instructional costs and services , ( ii ) selling and promotional , ( iii ) general and administrative , and ( iv ) depreciation and amortization . instructional costs and services . instructional costs and services are expenses directly attributable to the educational services our institutions provide to their students students . this expense category includes salaries and benefits for full-time faculty , administrators , and academic advisors , and costs associated with part-time faculty . instructional costs and services expenses also include costs associated with academic records and graduation , as well as other services provided by our institutions , such as evaluating transcripts . 81 at apus , instructional costs and services also includes expenses related to our undergraduate book grant program and instructional pay for part-time faculty that is primarily dependent on the number of students taught . beginning with the year ended december 31 , 2014 , instructional costs and services also includes operating expenses directly associated with hcon 's campus operations , including rent . selling and promotional . selling and promotional expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in student enrollment , as well as costs associated with advertising and the production of marketing materials related to both new enrollments and current students . our selling and promotional expenses are generally affected by the cost of advertising media , the efficiency of our selling efforts , salaries and benefits for our selling and admissions personnel , and the level of expenditures for advertising initiatives for new and existing academic programs . we believe the availability of title iv program funds to students has increased our marketability in non-military markets , but the nature of these markets , including the impact of competition , and the rising cost of internet and other advertising has caused our student acquisition costs to increase . this trend may continue and our student acquisition costs may increase
","The initiatives undertaken by APUS, including the HCON acquisition, have led to increased operating expenses and capital investments, which may not necessarily translate into higher revenue or net income. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 56% of APUS's students reported military service, making the institution reliant on Department of Defense (DoD) tuition assistance programs. Since 2006, APUS has seen significant growth due to participation in Title IV financial aid programs, which has altered its student body composition and necessitated a broader range of services. The challenges in forecasting student enrollment and conversion rates have been exacerbated by increased competition and changes in marketing strategies. Operating expenses have risen due to general administrative costs, financial aid processing, and technology investments, with bad debt expenses trending upward. APUS's tuition rates remain competitive, with the July 2015 increase being the first for undergraduates since 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2015, technology fee revenue was approximately $7.6 million, accounting for 2.3% of total revenue. The institution categorizes costs into instructional services, selling and promotional expenses, general and administrative costs, and depreciation. The reliance on Title IV funds has increased the average number of courses per student, complicating revenue forecasts. Overall, APUS faces strategic and operational challenges that could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations."

carver also maintains a specific reserve allowance for criticized & classified loans individually reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic 310 guidelines . the amount assigned to the specific reserve allowance is individually determined based upon the loan . the asc topic 310 guidelines require the use of one of three approved methods to estimate the amount to be reserved and or charged off for such credits . the three methods are as follows : 1. the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan 's effective interest rate , 2. the loan 's observable market price ; or 3. the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent . the institution may choose the appropriate asc topic 310 measurement on a loan-by-loan basis for an individually impaired loan , except for an impaired collateral dependent loan . guidance requires impairment of a collateral dependent loan to be measured using the fair value of collateral method . a loan is considered `` collateral dependent `` when the repayment of the debt will be provided solely by the underlying collateral , and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment . 44 criticized and classified loans with at risk balances of $ 500,000 or more and loans below $ 500,000 that the credit officer deems appropriate for review , are identified and reviewed for individual evaluation for impairment in accordance with asc topic 310 , accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan . carver also performs impairment analysis for all troubled debt restructurings ( â€œ tdrs â€ ) . if it is determined that it is probable the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according with the contractual terms of the loan agreement , the loan is categorized as impaired . if the loan is determined to be not impaired , it is then placed in the appropriate pool of criticized & classified loans to be evaluated for potential losses . loans determined to be impaired are then evaluated to determine the measure of impairment amount based on one of the three measurement methods noted above . if it is determined that there is an impairment amount , the bank then determines whether the impairment amount is permanent ( that is a confirmed loss ) , in which case the impairment is written down , or if it is other than permanent , in which case the bank establishes a specific valuation reserve that is included in the total alll . in accordance with guidance , if there is no impairment amount , no reserve is established for the loan . securities impairment the bank 's available-for-sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value , with any unrealized gains and losses , net of taxes , reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss . securities that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost . the fair values of securities in portfolio are based on published or securities dealers ' market values and are affected by changes in interest rates . story_separator_special_tag the negative provision is primarily related to the decrease in non-performing loans , the stabilization in valuations of non-performing loans and a decrease in loss experience . hfs loans decreased $ 16.5 million or 55.8 % to $ 13.1 million as the company continued to take aggressive steps to resolve troubled loans . during the fiscal year , $ 9.7 million in loans , net of charge-offs , transferred into the held-for-sale portfolio from the held for investment portfolio . this increase was offset by $ 25.9 million of sales and paydowns . liabilities and stockholders ' equity liabilities total liabilities decreased $ 3.1 million , or 0.5 % , to $ 581.5 million at march 31 , 2013 , compared to $ 584.6 million at march 31 , 2012 , due to reductions in deposits of $ 36.9 million partially offset by an increase in borrowings of $ 33.0 million . deposits decreased $ 36.9 million , or 6.9 % , to $ 495.7 million at march 31 , 2013 , compared to $ 532.6 million at march 31 , 2012 , due principally to $ 10.0 million in planned withdrawals from non-interest bearing control disbursements accounts and management 's decision not to renew higher cost certificates of deposit . advances from the federal home loan bank of new york ( â€œ fhlb-ny â€ ) and other borrowed money increased $ 33.0 million , or 75.9 % , to $ 76.4 million at march 31 , 2013 , compared to $ 43.4 million at march 31 , 2012 , as the company added short-term borrowings during the fiscal year to replace previously terminated long-term borrowings . stockholders ' equity total stockholders ' equity increased $ 116 thousand , or 0.2 % , to $ 56.7 million at march 31 , 2013 , compared to $ 56.6 million at march 31 , 2012 . the increase reflects net profit before taxes of $ 45 thousand for the fiscal year . comparison of operating results for the years ended march 31 , 2013 and 2012 net income/loss net income for fiscal year 2013 was $ 0.7 million compared to net loss of $ 23.4 million for the prior year , an increase of $ 24.1 million . this improvement was primarily driven by a negative provision for loan losses of $ 3.3 million in the current year versus a provision of $ 16.3 million in the prior year , and an increase in non-interest income to $ 7.0 million for $ 3.7 million . net interest income interest income decreased $ 4.2 million , or 14.9 % , to $ 23.8 million compared to $ 27.9 million in the prior year period , with the decrease primarily attributed to a $ 118.8 million , or 22.6 % , decrease in average loans . the average yield on loans increased 33 basis points to 5.26 % from 4.93 % , which was directly related to a reduction in non-performing loans . the decline in average loan balances did , however , decrease total interest income on loans . the average yield on mortgage-backed securities fell 80 basis points to 1.90 % from 2.70 % from the prior year period , as higher yielding securities experienced early payoffs and were replaced with lower yielding securities . interest expense decreased $ 3.2 million , or 39.4 % , to $ 4.9 million compared to $ 8.1 million in the prior year , as lower cost deposits replaced more expensive long-term borrowings . the prior year was also impacted by fees paid to prepay certain high coupon debt . the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 44 basis points to 0.99 % from 1.43 % . provision for loan losses the bank recorded a $ 3.3 million negative provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2013 compared to a $ 16.3 million provision for the prior year . for the period ended march 31 , 2013 , net charge-offs were $ 5.5 million compared to $ 19.7 million in the prior year period . charge-offs in both periods were primarily related to impaired loans and loans that were transferred to hfs . the negative provision of $ 3.3 million recorded in the current period is primarily related to the stabilization in valuations of non-performing loans and a decrease in loss experience . at march 31 , 2013 , non-performing assets totaled $ 46.1 million , or 7.2 % of total assets , compared to $ 86.4 million or 13.5 % of total assets at march 31 , 2012 . the allowance for loan losses was $ 11.0 million at march 31 , 2013 , which represents a ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans of 35.9 % 51 compared to $ 19.8 million , which represents a ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans of 36.3 % at march 31 , 2012 . the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 3.0 % at march 31 , 2013 , a decline from 4.8 % at march 31 , 2012 . non-interest income non-interest income increased $ 3.3 million , or 92.9 % , to $ 7.0 million compared to $ 3.7 million for the prior year period . the majority of the increase was attributable to gains on sales of loans and an increase in depository fees . non-interest income in the prior year was negatively impacted by hfs valuation adjustments of $ 1.9 million . non-interest expense non-interest expense decreased $ 1.7 million or 5.5 % to $ 29.2 million compared to $ 30.9 million in the prior year . non-interest expense was lower in all categories except data processing , with the largest decreases comprised of $ 1.0 million in compensation and benefits expenses and $ 0.3 million in fdic premiums . income taxes income tax expense was $ 0.3 million for the fiscal year compared to a benefit of $ 1.0 million
","Carver maintains a general reserve allowance in accordance with ASC Topic 450, evaluating the risk of loss potential across various loan pools, including 1-4 family, multifamily, commercial real estate, business loans, SBA loans, and consumer accounts. These pools are classified into risk categories: pass, special mention, substandard, and doubtful. The bank applies risk factors based on actual losses over the last four quarters and nine qualitative factors, which include changes in lending policies, economic conditions, loan portfolio characteristics, management experience, and collateral values. For criticized and classified loans, Carver follows ASC Topic 310 guidelines, assessing impairment through methods such as present value of expected cash flows or fair value of collateral. As of March 31, 2013, total liabilities decreased by $3.1 million (0.5%) to $581.5 million, with deposits down by $36.9 million (6.9%) to $495.7 million. Stockholders' equity rose by $116,000 (0.2%) to $56.7 million. Net income for fiscal year 2013 was $0.7 million, a $24.1 million improvement from a $23.4 million loss the previous year, driven by a negative provision for loan losses of $3.3 million compared to a $16.3 million provision in the prior year. Non-performing assets decreased to $46.1 million (7.2% of total assets) from $86.4 million (13.5% of total assets) year-over-year.  Non-interest income surged by $3.3 million (92.9%) to $7.0 million, while non-interest expenses fell by $1.7 million (5.5%) to $29.2 million."

and safety from the fda and responded to additional comments from the fda regarding the cmc technical section . we anticipate the approval of zimeta in the first half of 2018 , assuming that the fda finds our responses acceptable . the regulatory approval is expected , but is subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process . 47 we have initiated pre-launch activities for mirataz and zimeta , including build-out of a small commercial team , execution of distribution agreements and commercial scale-up and manufacturing . in addition , we executed a commercial manufacturing agreement with dpt laboratories , ltd. for the manufacture of mirataz and a commercial manufacturing agreement with corden pharma spa for the manufacture of zimeta . the two agreements provide for production to supply kindredbio 's initial launch and future commercial campaigns upon regulatory approval , with capabilities to meet excess demand . we have also completed the pivotal field effectiveness study of zimeta oral ( dipyrone oral gel ) for the treatment of fever in horses and announced positive topline results in december 2017. this study was a multicenter , randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled pivotal study that enrolled 139 horses to assess the effectiveness of zimeta oral . we have completed the in-life portion of the target animal safety study and are analyzing the data . we anticipate submitting the effectiveness and safety technical sections of the nada in the first half of 2018 , and the cmc technical section by the end of 2018 , assuming the data are supportive of approval . the oral gel form of dipyrone is expected to be an additional valuable tool for equine veterinarians to provide horse owners with an easy-to-administer fever reducing agent for the horse . we are currently developing kind-014 for the treatment of equine gastric ulcers in horses , kind-015 for the management of clinical signs associated with equine metabolic syndrome and epocat tm ( feline recombinant erythropoietin ) for the control of non-regenerative anemia in cats . we expect to continue pilot field efficacy studies for the three product candidates in 2018. in addition to early stage pilot field studies of anti-cytokine antibodies for atopic dermatitis in dogs and anti-tnf in septic foals , we are also developing multiple other products , including interleukin antibodies and canine checkpoint inhibitors . in all , we have over 20 programs for various indications for dogs , cats , and horses . in addition to the product candidates discussed above , we are in the early stages of development for multiple additional indications , including several biologics , with the potential to attain approval for one or more products annually for several years . we plan to commercialize our products in the united states through a direct sales force complemented by selected distributor relationships , and in the eu through distributors and other third parties . because we seek to identify product candidates that are not protected by third-party patents , we typically do not need to obtain licenses or make any upfront , milestone or royalty payments in connection with our product candidates . we have constructed a good manufacturing practice , or gmp , biologics manufacturing plant in burlingame , ca which is fully commissioned . we have proceeded to gmp manufacturing of our feline erythropoietin product candidate in january 2018. in addition , we acquired a second manufacturing plant in august 2017 in elwood , kansas and we have initiated the design and construction of our biologics manufacturing lines . the elwood facility includes approximately 180,000 square feet with clean rooms , utility , equipment , and related quality documentation suitable for small molecule and biologics manufacturing . we are a pre-commercialization company with no products approved for marketing and sale , and we have not generated any revenue . we have incurred significant net losses since our inception with cumulative net losses of $ 111,980,000 through december 31 , 2017. these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with investigating and developing our product candidates , research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations . historically , our funding has been a combination of private and public offerings . our initial public offering in december 2013 provided us with net proceeds of $ 54,871,000 and a follow-on public offering in april 2014 provided us with net proceeds of $ 58,065,000 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions . during the six months ended june 30 , 2017 , we completed the sale of 4,501,985 shares of common stock under an at market issuance sales agreement , or atm , with fbr capital markets & co. net proceeds , after deducting approximately $ 1,038,000 in underwriting commissions and offering

story_separator_special_tag in addition , higher stock-based compensation expense along with higher consulting and professional fees as we build out our corporate infrastructure , also contributed to the increase in expenses . general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 , 2016 increased by 6 % to $ 8.3 million compared with $ 7.9 million for the same period in 2015. the increase in general and administrative expense was related to increased headcount including higher marketing and corporate expenses as we have initiated pre-launch activities and build-out of a small commercial team . the increase was offset in part by lower consulting and professional fees as well as lower stock-based compensation expense . we expect general and administrative expense to increase going forward as we prepare for the commercial launches of zimeta and mirataz and the expansion of our sales force and medical affairs personnel including corporate infrastructure in the expected commercialization of the two products . restructuring costs we recorded a restructuring charge of $ 655,000 in the first quarter of 2016 in order to streamline our focus on our development programs

the value of its portfolio over the same properties as of the year ended december 31 , 2017. the total real estate portfolio value of $ 290,500,000 as of december 31 , 2018 consists of the same properties which made up omaha 's portfolio as of december 31 , 2017 less the three properties sold during 2018. equity in net income of investment decreased $ 5,478,000 to an income of approximately $ 5,842,000 for 2018 compared to income of approximately $ 11,320,000 for 2017. under the terms of the unsecured loan extension omaha signed effective july 1 , 2009 , as extended and modified , omaha was precluded from making distributions to its investors until its unsecured loan is paid . as a result of the aforementioned , registrant did not anticipate receiving any distributions from omaha during the foreseeable future and had reserved 100 % of the reported value prior to 2015. during 2016 and 2017 , the net operating income reported for omaha 's properties continued to improve which allowed omaha to continue to make payments on its unsecured loan . the improvement in omaha 's real estate values and operations allowed registrant to reduce the reserve to 35 % as of december 31 , 2016 and to 25 % as of december 31 , 2017. omaha 's mortgages and unsecured loan are encumbered with floating interest rates which started to increase near the end of 2016 and continued to increase during 2017 and 2018. omaha 's unsecured loan had a balance of $ 20,359,322 as of december 31 , 2017. during 2018 , omaha sold its garden apartment property in asheville , north carolina and its garden apartment property in fresno , california . net sales proceeds in each transaction were used to first pay selling expenses and retire each property 's related secured mortgage loan . remaining net sales proceeds were used to retire omaha 's unsecured loan and were used to retire omaha 's secured mortgage loan encumbering its high rise apartment property located in omaha , nebraska to further pay down omaha 's debt . retirement of the unsecured loan removed certain restrictions placed on omaha by the lender including making distributions . for the year ended december 31 , 2018 sentinel omaha reported a 3.0 % increase in real estate values . omaha anticipates the net operating income from its remaining portfolio to be flat during 2019 as compared to 2018. as noted above , all of omaha 's property mortgage loans and banks loans use floating rates based on one month libor rates plus the credit spread . 16 as noted earlier , during 2018 the floating rates on omaha loans increased as short term libor rates increased . the one month libor rate increased from an average of ( 0.7164 % ) during december 2016 to an average of ( 1.4925 % ) during december 2017 and an average of ( 2.4582 % ) during december 2018. fixed mortgage interest rates for multi-family properties of similar class and location as omaha 's portfolio also increased during 2017 from an approximate range of 4.10 % to 4.15 % in early 2017 to 4.35 % to 4.50 % near the end of 2017and further to an approximate range of 5.05 % to 5.10 % in december 2018. mortgage interest rates may continue to increase in 2019 if the u.s. federal reserve continues a policy to increase the federal funds rate . story_separator_special_tag although increases in fixed mortgage rates do not impact the operating cash flow of the omaha properties directly , increases in fixed and floating rates on commercial mortgage debt can have a negative impact on capitalization rates and the sales prices sentinel omaha may achieve in the future . since omaha has in the past two years paid off the unsecured debt along with improving performance at the properties , the debt risk to the investment is estimated to be lower . the investment in a 30 % non-controlling interest would still be valued at a discount due to the lack of control and liquidity . registrant will continue to report a reserve on the value of omaha on its books but due to omaha paying off the unsecured debt in 2018 the reserve has been reduced to 20 % as of march 31 , 2018. for additional analysis , please refer to the

22.0 million , or an average price of $ 28.66 per share . overview of 2020 results during 2020 , we continued to build on our sales and operational capabilities , as well as our financial foundation , to drive our long-term growth strategy . we delivered strong financial results and further enhanced our industry-leading offering of products and services despite the backdrop of the covid-19 pandemic . our net sales in 2020 increased 1.7 % , or $ 287.4 million , to $ 16,957.9 million compared to $ 16,670.5 million for 2019. the increase in net sales for the year was driven primarily by strong cigarette sales , including increases in cigarette manufacturers ' prices and growth in cigarette carton sales , partially offset by a 2.3 % decrease in sales of food/non-food . sales of cigarettes and food/non-food products for the year were impacted by changes in consumer buying habits as a result of the covid-19 pandemic . gross profit in 2020 decreased $ 35.9 million , or 3.9 % , to $ 888.3 million from $ 924.2 million in 2019 , driven primarily by a shift in overall sales mix to cigarettes , which have lower margins compared with food/non-food products , and higher lifo expense , partially offset by $ 1.9 million of incremental net inventory holding gains . gross profit margin was 5.24 % of total net sales for 2020 compared to 5.54 % in 2019. remaining gross profit margin ( 1 ) decreased to 5.23 % for 2020 from 5.53 % in 2019. the decline in remaining gross profit margin was driven primarily by the change in the sales mix between cigarettes and food/non-food and a decline in margins within the food/non-food category resulting from a shift in sales mix and lower gross profit margins in certain categories . we expect our gross profit margin to continue to be impacted by both sales mix and lower margins in certain product categories for some period of time as a direct result of the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic . operating expenses in 2020 decreased 4.6 % , or $ 38.0 million , to $ 793.6 million from $ 831.6 million in 2019. the decrease was driven primarily by increased productivity and cost savings initiatives , implemented mainly in response to the covid-19 pandemic . as outlined in our press release on april 14 , 2020 , we took steps during the second quarter to reduce operating costs to better align them with sales volume trends and to preserve liquidity . we also achieved cost savings through actions to reduce other non-essential costs including travel , meetings and events and other discretionary expenditures . operating expenses were 4.7 % of total net sales for 2020 compared to 5.0 % in 2019. operating expenses were 89.4 % of remaining gross profit ( 1 ) for 2020 , compared to 90.2 % of remaining gross profit in 2019. net

financial measures in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business . these non-gaap measures should be considered as a supplement to , and not as a substitute for , or superior to , financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap . these measures may be defined differently than other companies and therefore , such measures used by other companies may not be comparable to ours . we strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure . these non-gaap measures are defined as follows : ( i ) adjusted ebitda is a measure used by management to measure operating performance . adjusted ebitda is equal to net income adding back net interest expense , provision for income taxes , depreciation and amortization , lifo expense , stock-based compensation expense , net foreign currency transaction gains or losses . see the table below for additional details on the components of adjusted ebitda . we believe adjusted ebitda is one of the primary measures used externally by our investors , analysts and peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our results to other companies . ( ii ) net sales less excise taxes is a non-gaap financial measure which we provide to separate the increase in sales and gross profits due to product sales growth and increases in state , local and provincial excise taxes , which we are responsible for collecting and remitting . federal excise taxes are levied on the manufacturers who pass the tax on to us as part of the product cost and thus are not a component of our excise taxes . although increases in cigarette taxes result in higher net sales , our overall gross profit percentage may be reduced .

( vii ) operating expenses ( and the components thereof ) as a percentage of remaining gross profit is a non-gaap financial measure , which is used by management to measure operating leverage . although management also uses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales , this metric may be impacted on a comparable basis by , among other items , excise taxes , changes in manufacturers ' prices ( including inflation ) , and our continuing trend in sales mix shift from cigarettes to higher-margin food/non-food items which have substantially lower selling prices . 31 table of contents the following table reconciles adjusted ebitda to net income , as net income is the most comparable financial measure under u.s. gaap ( in millions ) : replace_table_token_16_th ( 1 ) interest expense , net , is reported net of interest income . 32 table of contents the following tables reconcile net sales , less excise taxes to net sales and remaining gross profit to gross profit ( including cigarette remaining gross profit and food/non-food remaining gross profit ) , their most comparable financial measures under u.s. gaap ( in millions , except percentages ) ( 1 ) : replace_table_token_17_th replace_table_token_18_th 33 table of contents replace_table_token_19_th ( 1 ) amounts and percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and might differ from unrounded results .

","In 2020, the company faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a decline in convenience retail store visits across North America. Despite this, net sales increased by 1.7% to $16,957.9 million from $16,670.5 million in 2019, primarily driven by strong cigarette sales, although food/non-food sales decreased by 2.3%. Gross profit fell by 3.9% to $888.3 million, with a gross profit margin of 5.24%, down from 5.54% in 2019. Operating expenses decreased by 4.6% to $793.6 million, representing 4.7% of total net sales, compared to 5.0% in 2019.

12,"35 net loan charge-off activity decreased on a year-to-year basis reflecting a relatively good local economy , sound underwriting discipline and loan problem resolution skills . the company 's net loan charge-offs over the last five years are shown in the table below : the provision for loan losses was $ 11.5 million and $ 18.7 million for the years ended december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the decrease in provisioning levels is largely due to improvements in certain asset quality measures , offset by shifts in the composition of loan portfolio mix , as certain portfolios require different levels of allowance allocation based upon the risks associated with each portfolio , as well as portfolio growth of outstanding balances . the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans was 1.27 % at december 31 , 2011 , as compared to 1.30 % at december 31 , 2010. the company 's results for 2011 were also positively impacted by growth in noninterest income . service charges on deposit accounts increased by 22.1 % from the prior year to $ 16.6 million due to increased customer utilization of overdraft privileges . interchange and atm fees increased to $ 7.7 million from $ 5.1 million in 2010. the increase was partially due to a reclassification of interchange income that was previously recorded as a net expense in other noninterest expense amounting to $ 1.5 million , as well as increased debit card usage by the bank 's customers . the debit card usage has increased due to marketing promotions related to a debit card point program . noninterest expense increased over the prior year by 4.3 % to $ 145.7 million . the increase in noninterest expense is largely related to the bank 's investment in its commercial business and increased spending on advertising to promote continued growth . in 2012 , management will continue to pursue disciplined growth and to endeavor to invest shareholders ' capital in initiatives to promote long term shareholder value . despite the industry challenges of a slow growth economy , increased competition , continued pressure on the net interest margin and increased regulatory and compliance requirements , management believes that it is imperative that the company continue to make strategic investments in its future . management will strive to grow the balance sheet and manage expenses in 2012 in order to achieve expected results . management anticipates that the continuation of solid fundamentals and asset quality will drive the company 's results in 2012. management has provided diluted earnings per share estimates of $ 2.05 to $ 2.15 in 2012 as compared to the diluted earnings per share of $ 2.12 for 2011 . 36 non-gaap measures when management assesses the company 's financial performance for purposes of making day-to-day and strategic decisions , it does so based upon the performance of its core banking business , which is primarily derived from the combination of net interest income and noninterest or fee income , reduced by operating expenses , the provision for loan losses , and the impact of income taxes . the company 's financial performance is determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( Â“gaapÂ” ) which sometimes includes gains or losses due to items that management does not believe are related to its core banking business , such as gains or losses on the sales of securities , merger and acquisition expenses , and other items . management , therefore , also computes the company 's non-gaap operating earnings , which excludes these items , to measure the strength of the company 's core banking business and to identify trends that may to some extent be obscured by gains or losses which management deems not to be core to the company 's operations . management believes that the financial impact of the items excluded when computing non-gaap operating earnings will disappear or become immaterial within a near-term finite period . management 's computation of the company 's non-gaap operating earnings information is set forth because management believes it may be useful for investors to have access to the same analytical tool used by management to evaluate the company 's core operational performance so that investors may assess the company 's overall financial health and identify business and performance trends that may be more difficult to identify and evaluate when noncore items are included . management also believes that the computation of non-gaap operating earnings may facilitate the comparison of the company to other companies in the financial services industry . non-gaap operating earnings should not be considered a substitute for gaap operating results . an item which management deems to be noncore and excludes when computing non-gaap operating earnings can be of substantial importance to the company 's results for any particular quarter or year . the company 's non-gaap operating earning information set forth is not necessarily comparable to non-gaap information which may be presented by other companies . the following table summarizes the impact of noncore items recorded for the time periods indicated below and reconciles them in accordance with gaap : replace_table_token_11_th 37 the following non-gaap financial measure is used by the company to provide information that management believes is useful to investors in understanding the company 's operating performance . the company 's tangible common equity ratio is 6.80 % , or 7.18 % when presented as adjusted to include the tax deductibility of certain goodwill . the following table reconciles the calculation of this non-gaap measure : replace_table_token_12_th financial position securities portfolio the

december 31 , 2011 , impaired loans included all commercial and industrial loans , commercial real estate loans , commercial construction , and small business loans that are on nonaccrual status , tdrs , and other loans that have been categorized as impaired . total impaired loans at december 31 , 2011 and 2010 were $ 61.7 million and $ 47.4 million , respectively . for additional information regarding the bank 's asset quality , including delinquent loans , nonaccruals , tdrs , and impaired loans , see note 4 , Â“loans , allowance for loan losses , and credit qualityÂ” within notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof . potential problem loans are any loans which are not included in nonaccrual or nonperforming loans , where known information about possible

commercial loans at the time periods indicated : table 9 Â— potential problem commercial loans replace_table_token_20_th at december 31 , 2011 , these potential problem loans continued to perform with respect to payments . management actively monitors these loans and strives to minimize any possible adverse impact to the bank . allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for probable loan losses based upon evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio . the allowance is increased by providing for loan losses through a charge to expense and by recoveries of loans previously charged-off and is reduced by loans being charged-off . while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans , future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on increases in nonperforming loans , changes in economic conditions , or for other reasons . additionally , various regulatory agencies , as an integral part of the bank 's examination process , periodically assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and may require it to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs . as of december 31 , 2011 , the allowance for loan losses totaled $ 48.3 million , or 1.27 % of total loans as compared to $ 46.3 million , or 1.30 % of total loans , at december 31 , 2010. the increase in the amount of allowance and its corresponding decrease as a percentage of total loans , is largely due to improvements in certain asset quality measures , offset by shifts in the composition of loan portfolio mix , as certain portfolios require different levels of allowance allocation based upon the risks associated with each portfolio , as well as portfolio growth of outstanding balances . 46 the following table summarizes changes in the allowance for loan losses and other selected statistics for the periods presented : table 10 Â— summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses replace_table_token_21_th 47 for purposes of the allowance for loan losses , management segregates the loan portfolio into the portfolio segments detailed in the table below . the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made to each loan category using the analytical techniques and estimation methods described herein . while these amounts represent management 's best estimate of the distribution of probable losses at the evaluation dates , they are not necessarily indicative of either the categories in which actual losses may occur or the extent of such actual losses that may be recognized within each category . each of these loan categories possess unique risk characteristics that are considered when determining the appropriate level of allowance for each segment . the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio . the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated : table 11 Â— summary of allocation of allowance for loan losses replace_table_token_22_th to determine if a loan should be charged-off , all possible sources of repayment are analyzed . possible sources of repayment include the potential for future cash flows , the value of the bank 's collateral , and the strength of co-makers or guarantors . when available information confirms that specific loans or portions thereof are uncollectible , these amounts are promptly charged-off against the allowance for loan losses and any recoveries of such previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance . regardless of whether a loan is unsecured or collateralized , the company charges off the amount of any confirmed loan loss in the period when the loans , or portions of loans , are deemed uncollectible . for troubled , collateral-dependent loans , loss-confirming events may include an appraisal or other valuation that reflects a shortfall between the value of the collateral and the book value of the loan or receivable , or a deficiency balance following the sale of the collateral . during 2011 allowance amounts increased by approximately $ 2.0 million to $ 48.3 million at december 31 , 2011. for additional information regarding the bank 's allowance for loan losses , see note 1 , Â“summary of significant accounting

areas of our operations which we believe have the greatest potential to increase our revenues , including the closure of a redundant operations center in new york city that we inherited as part of the steel media acquisition. story_separator_special_tag management reviews its accounts receivable each reporting period to determine if the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate . such allowances , if any , would be recorded in the period the impairment is identified . it is reasonably possible that the company 's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change . uncollectible accounts receivables are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when all reasonable efforts to collect the amounts due have been exhausted . impairment of long-lived assets the company 's long-lived assets consist of property and equipment . the company evaluates its investment in long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the net carrying amount may not be recoverable . it is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of legal factors , market conditions , operational performance indicators , technological or other industry changes . if circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment , the company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value . if the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis , an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value . fair value is determined through various valuation techniques , including discounted cash flow models , quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals , as considered necessary . debt issuance costs , debt discount and detachable debt-related warrants costs incurred to issue debt are deferred and recorded as a reduction to the debt balance in our consolidated balance sheets . we amortize debt issuance costs over the expected term of the related debt using the effective interest method . debt discounts relate to the relative fair value of warrants issued in conjunction with the debt and are also recorded as a reduction to the debt balance and accreted over the expected term of the debt to interest expense using the effective interest method . income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of fasb asc topic 740 , Â“income tax , Â” which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns . deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequence attributable to the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements . deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled . the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date . the company establishes a valuation when it is more likely than not that the assets will not be recovered . asc topic 740-10 , Â“accounting for uncertainty in income taxes , Â” defines uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position as a two-step process . the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination , including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position . the second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements . a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement . tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met . previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met . penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period incurred . 24 going concern evaluation in connection with preparing its consolidated financial statements , management evaluates whether there are conditions and events , considered in the aggregate , that raise substantial doubt about the company 's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that the financial statements are issued . see management 's going concern evaluation for the year ended december 31 , 2017 in the Â“liquidity and capital resourcesÂ” section above . stock-based compensation the company accounts for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on their fair values and recognizes such awards as compensation expense over the vesting period using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for each award as required by fasb asc topic no . 718 , compensation-stock compensation . if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying vested or unvested stock-based awards , we may be required to accelerate , increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense , or record additional expense for vested stock-based awards . future stock-based compensation expense and unearned stock- based compensation may increase to the extent we grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards . recent accounting pronouncements see note 2 Â— Â“summary of significant accounting policiesÂ” included in Â“item 8 Â— financial statements and supplementary dataÂ” in this report regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our financial statements . off balance sheet arrangements as of the date of this report , we do not have any off-balance sheet

In 2017, the company launched a new Srax Social tool and a guide on people-based advertising, while also unveiling a new branding strategy. The third quarter of 2017 saw the introduction of Srax Fan and Srax Auto, although they were in early stages and not expected to significantly contribute to revenue in 2018. The BigToken project was also announced, with an alpha launch in March 2018. Financially, the company reported a revenue decrease in 2017 compared to 2016, attributed to declines from Srax sell-side and buy-side clients, partially offset by growth in SraxMD. Cost of revenue decreased to 39.9% of total revenue in 2017 from 64.9% in 2016, leading to a substantial increase in gross margin. Operating expenses rose by approximately 3.2% in 2017, primarily due to increased sales salaries and commissions. The company also evaluates accounts receivable for potential impairments and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on future tax consequences. Overall, the company is focused on enhancing its operational efficiency and revenue potential while navigating financial challenges."
14,"comparable store sales , including the increase in e-commerce sales , decreased 1.3 % for fiscal 2018 on a 52-week basis . we use comparable store sales to measure our ability to achieve sales increases from stores that have been open for at least 13 full fiscal months . stores closed during the year are included in the comparable store sales calculation only for the full fiscal months of the year the stores were open . relocated stores are removed from the comparable store base when the existing store closes , and the new replacement store is added into the comparable store sales calculation after 13 full fiscal months of activity . increases in comparable store sales are an important factor in maintaining or increasing the profitability of existing stores . gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales . cost of sales has various distinct components including : product cost of sales ( including inbound freight , damages and inventory shrinkage and loyalty reward program charges ) , store occupancy costs ( including rent and depreciation of leasehold improvements and other property and equipment ) , outbound freight costs ( including e-commerce shipping ) and central distribution costs ( including operational costs and depreciation of leasehold improvements and other property and equipment ) . product and outbound freight costs are variable , while occupancy and central distribution costs are largely fixed . 24 accordingly , gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales can be influenced by many factors including overall sales performance . for fiscal 2018 , gross profit decreased 2.2 % to $ 203.1 million from $ 207.5 million for fiscal 2017 . gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 31.4 % for fiscal 2018 from 32.7 % in fiscal 2017 , due primarily to higher store occupancy , outbound freight and central distribution costs . operating expenses , including the costs of operating our stores and corporate headquarters , are also an important component of our operating performance . compensation and benefits comprise the majority of our operating expenses . operating expenses contain fixed and variable costs , and managing the operating expense ratio ( operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales ) is an important focus of management as we seek to increase our overall profitability . operating expenses include cash costs as well as non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization associated with corporate and omni-channel property and equipment . because many operating expenses are fixed costs , and because operating costs tend to rise over time , increases in comparable store sales typically are necessary to prevent meaningful increases in the operating expense ratio . operating expenses can also include certain costs that are of a one-time or non-recurring nature . while these costs must be considered to understand fully our operating performance , we typically identify such costs separately where significant in the consolidated statements of income so that we can evaluate comparable expense data across different periods . strategic areas of emphasis our strategic areas of emphasis include product revitalization and reinvention , merchandise margin expansion , omni-channel growth , profitability and infrastructure acceleration and supply chain optimization . as part of product revitalization , we plan to focus on our wall dÃ©cor category , improve overall product design and quality and introduce new complimentary categories including table top , rugs and bedding . merchandise margin expansion includes plans for additional pricing and promotions analytics and directly sourcing products from manufacturers to improve product margin . as part of omni-channel growth , profitability and infrastructure acceleration , we plan to focus on expanding our bopis fulfillment option and vendor direct shipping fulfillment methods as well as continuing our website and mobile improvements . we also expect to refresh a number of our existing stores with elements from a new store concept that supports omni-channel retailing , provides purposeful navigation and has an updated visual presence . finally , to optimize our supply chain and save on transportation costs , we plan to stand up a third-party logistics distribution center in texas to deliver product to a portion of our stores in that geographic area and expand our existing west coast bypass operation to service stores on the west coast . store growth we opened 25 new stores and closed 15 stores in fiscal 2018 compared to 31 new store openings and 17 store closures in fiscal 2017 . for fiscal 2018 , we ended the year with 428 stores compared to 418 stores at the end of fiscal 2017 , representing a 2.4 % increase in store units and a 3.2 % increase in store square footage . we expect to open and close approximately five to seven locations for no net new stores in fiscal 2019 . the timing of the new store openings will be primarily during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year , while closings will be near the end of the fiscal year . we are slowing the pace of our new store growth in fiscal 2019 compared to recent years as we prioritize sustained improvement in overall sales productivity and develop a future state plan for infrastructure that complements our omni-channel concept and improves the customer experience . the following table summarizes our stores in terms of size as of february 2 , 2019 and february 3 , 2018 : replace_table_token_6_th story_separator_special_tag decrease in merchandise margin was primarily due to a general increase in promotional offers and a growing mix of third-party drop ship 27 sales which was partially offset by a higher initial retail price and the elimination of stacking coupon offers . merchandise margin also benefited from favorable shrink results and a decrease in expenses related to our loyalty program . story_separator_special_tag our operating performance could suffer if net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year . see note 13 - quarterly financial information ( unaudited ) to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 , financial statements and supplementary data , of this form 10-k. inflation we do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three fiscal years . there can be no assurance , however , that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future . critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts contained in the financial statements and related disclosures . we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances . actual results may differ from these estimates . our critical accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements . certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements . the following discussion aggregates the various critical accounting policies addressed throughout the financial statements , the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying conditions and assumptions . inventory valuation â€” our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value , net of reserves and allowances , with cost determined using the average cost method with average cost approximating current cost . the carrying value of our inventory is affected by reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence . we estimate as a percentage of sales the amount of shrinkage that has occurred between the most recently completed store physical count and the end of the financial reporting period based upon historical physical inventory count results . management adjusts these estimates based on changes , if any , in the trends yielded by our physical inventory counts , which occur throughout the fiscal year . historically the variation between our recorded estimates and observed results has been insignificant , and although possible , significant future variation is not expected . if our estimated shrinkage reserve varied by 10 % from the amount recorded , the carrying value of inventory would have changed approximately $ 125,000 as of february 2 , 2019 . we also evaluate the cost of our inventory by category and class of merchandise in relation to the estimated sales price . this evaluation is performed to ensure that we do not carry inventory at a value in excess of the amount we expect to realize upon the sale of the merchandise . our reserves for excess inventory and inventory obsolescence ( in connection with which we reduce merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value ) are also estimated based upon our historical experience of selling goods below cost . historically , the variation between our estimates to account for excess and obsolete inventory and actual results has been insignificant . as of february 2 , 2019 , our reserve for obsolescence was approximately $ 255,000 . 30 impairments â€” in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board ( â€œ fasb â€ ) accounting standards codification ( â€œ asc â€ ) 360 , â€œ property , plant , and equipment â€ , we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable . this review includes the evaluation of individual underperforming retail stores and assessing the recoverability of the carrying values of the assets related to such stores . future cash flows are projected for the remaining lease life . the key assumptions used to determine the estimated cash flows for these stores include net sales and gross margin performance , payroll and related items , occupancy costs and other costs to operate . we calculate the fair values of long-lived assets using the age-life method . under this method , the replacement cost of an asset is estimated and reduced by depreciation based on the effective age of the asset and its expected useful life . this method takes into consideration the fact that we will continue to use these assets based on a presumed investment decision where the expected cash flows from operating the store are greater than the expected cash flows that result from not operating the store . if the estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of the assets , we record an impairment charge equal to the difference , if any , between the assets ' fair values and carrying values . we have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented . however , if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values , we may be exposed to losses that could be material . we are currently reassessing the estimates and assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses in connection with our adoption of asu 2016-02 , â€œ leases ( topic 842 ) â€ as our operating lease assets will be subject to accounting standards codification ( â€œ asc â€ ) topic 360 , property , plant , and equipment . insurance reserves â€” workers ' compensation , general liability and employee medical insurance programs are predominately self-insured . it is our policy to record a self-insurance liability using estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported or paid , based on historical claims experience
","For fiscal 2018, comparable store sales, including e-commerce, decreased by 1.3% on a 52-week basis, reflecting challenges in maintaining sales growth from stores open for at least 13 months. Gross profit fell by 2.2% to $203.1 million from $207.5 million in fiscal 2017, with gross profit as a percentage of net sales declining to 31.4% from 32.7%, primarily due to increased store occupancy, outbound freight, and central distribution costs. Operating expenses, which include compensation and benefits, are crucial for profitability, and managing the operating expense ratio is a key focus. The company opened 25 new stores and closed 15 in fiscal 2018, resulting in a total of 428 stores, a 2.4% increase from 418 stores in fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2019, the company plans to open and close approximately five to seven locations, maintaining a net of zero new stores, while emphasizing improvements in sales productivity and omni-channel infrastructure. Merchandise margin decreased due to increased promotional offers and a growing mix of third-party drop ship sales, although it was partially offset by higher initial retail prices. As of February 2, 2019, the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately $255,000, and the company has not experienced significant impacts from inflation over the past three years."

16,"beginning in fiscal year 2009 and continuing throughout much of fiscal year 2012 , housing markets deteriorated in many of our market areas and we experienced significantly higher levels of delinquencies and non-performing assets , primarily in our construction and land development loan portfolios . during this period , home and lot sales activity was exceptionally slow , causing stress on builders ' and developers ' cash flows and their ability to service debt , which was reflected in our increased non-performing asset totals . further , property values generally declined , reducing the value of the collateral securing loans . in addition , other non-housing-related segments of the loan portfolio developed signs of stress and increasing levels of non-accruing loans as the effects of the recent recession became more evident and the pace of the recovery remained slow . as a result , during these periods our provision for loan losses was significantly higher than historical levels and our normal expectations . this higher than normal level of delinquencies and non-accruals also had a material adverse effect on operating income as a result of foregone interest revenues , increased loan collection costs and carrying costs and valuation adjustments for reo . during both fiscal 2013 and 2014 , home and lot sales activity and real estate values have modestly improved 63 along with general economic conditions resulting in materially lower loan charge-offs and write-downs of real estate owned in fiscal 2014. as a result , during the year ended june 30 , 2014 , our

","From fiscal year 2009 to 2012, housing markets faced significant deterioration, leading to increased delinquencies and non-performing assets, particularly in construction and land development loans. This resulted in a higher provision for loan losses, adversely affecting operating income due to lost interest revenues and increased collection costs. However, by fiscal years 2013 and 2014, home and lot sales improved, contributing to a decrease in loan charge-offs and a $7.4 million reduction in the provision for loan losses. For the year ending June 30, 2014, net income rose to $10.3 million from $9.1 million in 2013, with earnings per share increasing to $0.54.  By June 30, 2014, stockholders' equity increased to $377.2 million, bolstered by a $10.3 million rise in retained earnings. The bank also opened a commercial loan production office in Roanoke, Virginia, and planned to acquire ten branches from Bank of America, which would add approximately $504 million in deposits. Net interest income for the year was $54.8 million, a 3.2% increase from the previous year, despite a slight decline in interest income on loans. Overall, the bank aims to enhance its franchise value through strategic growth while maintaining a community-focused service approach."
17,"lower net income and eps from continuing operations in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to asset valuation charges related to the franklin county wind farm in 2016 , partially offset by higher electric and gas margins , higher afudc ( primarily related to marshalltown ) and losses on sales of ipl 's minnesota electric and gas distribution assets in 2015. refer to â€œ results of operations â€ for additional details regarding the various factors impacting earnings during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . 2016 overview - in 2016 , alliant energy , ipl and wpl focused on achieving financial objectives and executing their strategic plan . key developments in 2016 include the following : ipl 's expansion of wind generation - in october 2016 , ipl and the iowa office of consumer advocate , among other customer groups , filed a settlement agreement with the iub regarding the appropriate rate-making principles for up to 500 mw of additional wind generation at ipl . in october 2016 , the iub issued an order approving the settlement agreement , with limited modifications , and establishing rate-making principles , which ipl accepted , with key terms as follows . refer to â€œ strategic overview â€ for further discussion . â–ª up to 500 mw of additional wind generation that qualifies for the full level of production tax credits , regardless of the location in iowa , with a cost cap of $ 1,830/kilowatt , including afudc and transmission costs . any costs incurred in excess of this $ 1,830/kilowatt cost cap are expected to be incorporated into rates if determined to be reasonable and prudent . â–ª a depreciable life of the wind generation of 40 years , unless changed as a result of a contested case before the iub . â–ª an 11.0 % return on common equity , with the exception of certain transmission facilities classified as intangible assets , which would earn the rate of return on common equity the iub finds reasonable during a future rate case . franklin county wind farm - in addition to ipl 's expansion of wind generation discussed above , in february 2017 , ferc issued an order approving the transfer of the 99 mw franklin county wind farm from aef to ipl . alliant energy and ipl currently expect to complete this transfer in 2017. ipl 's and wpl 's potential expansion of wind generation - in addition to ipl 's 500 mw expansion of wind generation and transfer of the 99 mw franklin county wind farm to ipl in 2017 discussed above , ipl and wpl are each exploring options to own and operate up to 200 mw of additional new wind generation . wpl 's construction of the riverside expansion - in may 2016 , wpl received an order from the pscw authorizing wpl to construct an approximate 730 mw natural gas-fired combined-cycle egu in beloit , wisconsin , referred to as the riverside expansion . after receiving the final necessary regulatory approvals and permits in the third quarter of 2016 , wpl began constructing the riverside expansion . wpl currently expects to place the riverside expansion in service by early 2020. in november 2016 , various electric cooperatives notified wpl of their intent to exercise their options to acquire approximately 65 mw of the riverside expansion while the egu is being constructed . as a result of the various electric cooperatives funding a portion of the capital expenditures during construction , wpl 's estimated portion of capital expenditures is expected to be approximately $ 640 million . wpl 's wisconsin retail electric and gas rate case ( 2017/2018 test period ) - in december 2016 , wpl received an order from the pscw authorizing wpl to implement an increase in annual retail electric rates of $ 9 million , or approximately 1 % , and an increase in annual retail gas rates of $ 9 million , or approximately 13 % . these increases are effective january 1 , 2017 and extend through the end of 2018. the order included a return on common equity of 10.0 % and continues a regulatory return on common equity sharing mechanism , whereby wpl must defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds 10.25 % during the 2017 and 2018 test period . wpl must defer 50 % of its excess earnings between 10.25 % and 11.00 % , and 100 % of any excess earnings above 11.00 % . miso transmission owner return on equity complaints - a group of miso cooperative and municipal utilities previously filed two complaints with ferc requesting a reduction to the base return on equity used by miso transmission owners , including itc and atc . in september 2016 , ferc issued an order on the first complaint and established a base return on equity of 10.32 % , excluding any incentive adders granted by ferc , effective september 28 , 2016 , and for the refund period from november 12 , 2013 through february 11 , 2015. in october 2016 , in response to miso 's and the miso transmission owners ' request , ferc ordered the related refunds to be issued no later than july 2017. in june 2016 , a ferc administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the second complaint and recommended a base return on equity of 9.70 % , excluding any incentive adders granted by ferc , for the refund period from february 12 , 2015 through may 11 , 2016. a final decision from ferc on the second complaint is currently expected in the first half of 2017. as a result of the two miso complaints , alliant energy and wpl have realized a cumulative $ 24 million of reductions in the amounts of equity income from atc through december 31 , 2016 , including $ 9 million realized in 2016 . story_separator_special_tag 37 variances -

alliant energy 's cost of gas sold decreased $ 25 million in 2016 and $ 109 million in 2015 . the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower natural gas prices . the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower retail gas volumes at ipl and wpl caused by temperatures discussed above and lower natural gas prices . refer to note 1 ( g ) for additional information relating to natural gas cost recoveries . refer to note 2 for information on gas rate increases in 2017. other utility revenues - variances between periods in utility other revenues were as follows ( in millions ) : replace_table_token_26_th replace_table_token_27_th ( a ) approximately 50 % of all margins earned from ipl 's sharing mechanism relating to optimizing gas capacity contracts flow through the gas adjustment clause to reduce retail gas customer bills in iowa . the remaining margins are retained by ipl and recorded in utility other revenues . due to the extreme cold temperatures causing natural gas price fluctuations in the first quarter of 2014 , margins were higher than normal in 2014. non-regulated revenues - alliant energy 's non-regulated revenues decreased $ 9 million in 2015 , primarily due to decreased revenues at transportation resulting from decreased demand for freight , barge and transfer services . 38 asset valuation charges for franklin county wind farm -

","In 2016, Alliant Energy reported lower net income and earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations compared to 2015, primarily due to asset valuation charges related to the Franklin County Wind Farm, which were partially offset by increased electric and gas margins and higher Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC), particularly from Marshalltown. Key developments included IPL's plan to expand wind generation by up to 500 MW, with a cost cap of $1,830 per kilowatt, and a 40-year depreciable life for the new wind assets. The Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) approved this expansion in October 2016. Additionally, the transfer of the 99 MW Franklin County Wind Farm to IPL was expected to be completed in 2017. WPL also received authorization to construct a 730 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle unit, with an estimated capital expenditure of $640 million. In December 2016, WPL was authorized to increase retail electric rates by $9 million (1%) and gas rates by $9 million (13%), effective January 1, 2017. Furthermore, FERC established a base return on equity of 10.32% for MISO transmission owners, resulting in a cumulative $24 million reduction in equity income from ATC through December 2016. Alliant Energy's cost of gas sold decreased by $25 million in 2016, attributed to lower natural gas prices. Overall, the company faced various operational challenges and regulatory changes while pursuing strategic growth in renewable energy."

quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year fluctuations due to the effect of competition on pricing , the frequency and severity of losses , the effect of weather and natural disasters on losses , general economic conditions , the general regulatory environment in states in which an insurer operates , state regulation of insurance including premium rates , changes in fair value of investments , and other factors such as changes in tax laws . the property and casualty insurance industry has been highly cyclical , with periods of high premium rates and shortages 29 of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity . these cycles can have a significant impact on the company 's ability to grow and retain business . the company is headquartered in los angeles , california and operates primarily as a personal automobile insurer selling policies through a network of independent agents , 100 % owned insurance agents and direct channels , in thirteen states : arizona , california , florida , georgia , illinois , michigan , nevada , new jersey , new york , oklahoma , pennsylvania , texas , and virginia . the company also offers homeowners

net income for the year ended december 31 , 2015 decreased to $ 74.5 million , or $ 1.35 per diluted share , from $ 177.9 million , or $ 3.23 per diluted share , for the same period in 2014 . included in net income is $ 126.3 million of pre-tax investment income that was generated during 2015 on a portfolio of $ 3.4 billion at fair value at december 31 , 2015 , compared to $ 125.7 million of

that its marketing efforts , combined with its ability to maintain relatively low prices and a strong reputation , make the company competitive in california and in other states . the company believes its thorough underwriting process gives it an advantage over competitors . the company 's agent relationships and underwriting and claims processes are its most important competitive advantages . the company 's operating results and growth have allowed it to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations , which was approximately $ 190 million and $ 247 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively . cash flow from operations has been used to pay shareholder dividends and help support growth . economic and industry wide factors regulatory uncertainty â€”the insurance industry is subject to strict state regulation and oversight and is governed by the laws of each state in which each insurance company operates . state regulators generally have substantial power and authority over insurance companies including , in some states , approving rate changes and rating factors , and establishing minimum capital and surplus requirements . in many states , insurance commissioners may emphasize different agendas or interpret existing regulations differently than previous commissioners . there is no certainty that current or future regulations and the interpretation of those regulations by insurance commissioners and the courts will not have an adverse impact on the company . cost uncertainty â€”because insurance companies pay claims after premiums are collected , the ultimate cost of an insurance policy is not known until well after the policy revenues are earned . consequently , significant assumptions are made when establishing insurance rates and loss reserves . while insurance companies use sophisticated models and experienced actuaries to assist in setting rates and establishing loss reserves , there can be no assurance that current rates or current reserve estimates will be adequate . story_separator_special_tag while there are certainly other factors , the company believes that the following three items tend to create the most variability between expected losses and actual losses . 33 ( 1 ) inflation for the company 's california automobile lines of insurance business , total reserves are comprised of the following : bi reservesâ€”approximately 60 % of total reserves material damage ( `` md `` ) reserves , including collision and comprehensive property damageâ€”approximately 20 % of total reserves loss adjustment expenses reservesâ€”approximately 20 % of total reserves . loss development on md reserves is generally insignificant because md claims are generally settled in a shorter period than bi claims . the majority of the loss adjustment expenses reserves are estimated costs to defend bi claims , which tend to require longer periods of time to settle as compared to md claims . bi loss reserves are generally the most difficult to estimate because they take longer to close than other coverages . bi coverage in the company 's policies includes injuries sustained by any person other than the insured , except in the case of uninsured or underinsured motorist bi coverage , which covers damages to the insured for bi caused by uninsured or underinsured motorists . bi payments are primarily for medical costs and general damages . the following table presents the typical closure patterns of bi claims in the company 's california personal automobile insurance coverage : replace_table_token_16_th bi claims closed in the accident year reported are generally the smaller and less complex claims that settle for approximately $ 3,000 to $ 3,500 , on average , whereas the total average settlement , once all claims are closed in a particular accident year , is approximately $ 10,000 to $ 11,000. the company creates incurred and paid loss triangles to estimate ultimate losses utilizing historical payment and reserving patterns and evaluates the results of this analysis against its frequency and severity analysis to establish bi loss reserves . the company adjusts development factors to account for inflation trends it sees in loss severity . as a larger proportion of claims from an accident year are settled , there becomes a higher degree of certainty for the loss reserves established for that accident year . consequently , there is a decreasing likelihood of loss reserve development on any particular accident year , as those periods age . at december 31 , 2015 , the accident years that are most likely to develop are the 2013 through 2015 accident years ; however , it is possible that older accident years could develop as well . in general , the company expects that historical claims trends will continue with costs tending to increase , which is generally consistent with historical data , and therefore the company believes that it is reasonable to expect inflation to continue . many potential factors can affect the bi inflation rate , including changes in claims handling process , changes in statutes and regulations , the number of litigated files , increased use of medical procedures such as mris and epidural injections , general economic factors , timeliness of claims adjudication , vehicle safety , weather patterns , and gasoline prices , among other factors ; however , the magnitude of the impact of such factors on the inflation rate is unknown . the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the california automobile bi severity could vary from recorded amounts by as much as 10 % , 5 % , and 3 % for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively . at december 31 , 2015 , the loss severity for the amounts recorded at december 31 , 2014 changed by ( 2.7 ) % , 1.7 % , and 1.3 % for the 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 accident years , respectively . comparatively , at december 31 , 2014 , the loss severity for the amounts recorded at december 31 , 2013 changed by ( 3.1 ) % , ( 1.3 ) % , and 0.4 % for the 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 accident years , respectively . 34 the following table presents the effects of the california automobile bi loss reserves on the 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 accident years based on possible variations in the severity recorded ; however , the variation could be more or less than these amounts . california automobile bodily injury inflation reserve sensitivity analysis accident year number of claims expected actual recorded severity at 12/31/15 implied inflation rate recorded ( 1 )

","Investors are advised to be cautious regarding forward-looking statements in the company's annual report, as these statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could lead to actual results differing significantly from expectations. The property and casualty insurance industry is characterized by cyclical fluctuations influenced by competition, loss frequency and severity, weather events, economic conditions, and regulatory environments. The company, headquartered in Los Angeles, operates primarily in personal automobile insurance across 13 states, with private passenger automobile lines accounting for 77.9% of its $3.0 billion direct premiums written in 2015. The company's net income for 2015 was $74.5 million ($1.35 per diluted share), a decrease from $177.9 million ($3.23 per diluted share) in 2014, despite generating $126.3 million in pre-tax investment income from a $3.4 billion portfolio. The company reported cash flow from operations of approximately $190 million in 2015, down from $247 million in 2014. Key factors affecting the company's performance include regulatory uncertainty, cost uncertainty, and inflation, particularly in California's automobile insurance sector, where bodily injury reserves are approximately 60% of total reserves. The company anticipates that claims costs will continue to rise, with potential variations in bodily injury severity recorded at 12/31/15 suggesting a possible 10% variation for 2015, 5% for 2014, and 3% for 2013.

20,"through increased collaboration with great lakes ' other lines of business , the demolition segment recently expanded into the new york area and marine demolition markets , specifically , bridge demolition across the eastern part of the u.s. through an acquisition at the end of 2012 , the demolition segment 's scope of work has been expanded into the midwest u.s. market . the company also owns 50 % of amboy aggregates ( Â“amboyÂ” ) and 50 % of terrasea environmental solutions ( Â“terraseaÂ” ) as joint ventures . amboy 's primary business is dredging sand from the entrance channel to the new york harbor in order to provide sand and aggregate for use in road and building construction and for clean land fill . amboy also imports stone from upstate new york and nova scotia and distributes it throughout the new york area . terrasea is engaged in the environmental services business through its ability to remediate contaminated soil and dredged sediment treatment . the company operates in two reportable segments : dredging and demolition . contract revenues most of the company 's dredging contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid . the types of equipment required to perform the specified service and the estimated project duration affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that dredging contractors will bid . the company recognizes contract revenues under the percentage-of-completion method , based on the company 's engineering estimates of the physical percentage completed for dredging projects and using a cost-to-cost approach for demolition projects . for dredging projects , costs of contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the gross profit percentage expected to be achieved upon ultimate completion of each dredging project . for demolition projects , contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the estimated gross profit percentage . provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined . claims for additional compensation due to the company are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled . billings on contracts are generally submitted after verification with the customers of physical progress and may not match the timing of revenue recognition . the difference between amounts billed and recognized as revenue is reflected in the balance sheet as either contract revenues in excess of billings or billings in excess of contract revenues . contract modifications may be negotiated when a change from the original contract specifications is encountered , necessitating a change in project scope or performance methodology and or material disposal . significant expenditures incurred directly for major contracts are deferred and recognized as costs of contracts based on contract performance over the duration of the related project . these expenditures are reported as prepaid expenses . see item 9a . Â“controls and procedures.Â” 36 costs and expenses the components of costs of contract revenues include labor , equipment ( including depreciation , maintenance , insurance and long-term rentals ) , fuel , subcontracts , short-term rentals and project overhead . hourly labor is generally hired on a project-by-project basis . much of our domestic hourly labor force is represented by labor unions with collective bargaining agreements that expire at various dates during 2013 through 2015 , which historically have been extended without disruption . costs of contract revenues vary significantly depending on the type and location of work performed and assets utilized . generally , capital projects have the highest margins due to the complexity of the projects , while coastal protection projects have the most volatile margins because they are most often exposed to variability in weather conditions . the company 's cost structure includes significant annual equipment related costs , including depreciation , maintenance , insurance and long-term equipment rentals , averaging approximately 21 % to 25 % of total costs of contract revenues over the last three years . during the year , both equipment utilization and the timing of cost expenditures fluctuate significantly . accordingly , the company allocates these equipment costs to interim periods in proportion to revenues recognized over the year to better match revenues and expenses . specifically , at each interim reporting date the company compares actual revenues earned to date on the company 's dredging contracts to expected annual revenues and recognizes equipment costs on the same proportionate basis . in the fourth quarter , any over or under allocated equipment costs are recognized such that the expense for the year equals actual equipment costs incurred during the year . as a result of this methodology , the recorded expense in any interim period may be higher or lower than the actual equipment costs incurred in that interim period . primary factors that determine operating profitability dredging . the company 's results of operations for its dredging segment for a calendar or quarterly period are generally determined by the following three factors : bid wins and dredge employment Â—the company 's dredging segment generates revenues when the company wins a bid for a dredging contract and starts that project . although the company 's dredging equipment is subject to downtime for scheduled periodic maintenance and repair , the company seeks to maximize its revenues by employing its dredging equipment on a full-time basis . if a dredge is idle ( i.e . , the dredge is not employed on a dredging project or undergoing scheduled periodic maintenance and repair ) , the company does not earn revenue with respect to that dredge during the time period for which it is idle . project and dredge mix Â—the company 's domestic dredging projects generally involve domestic capital , maintenance and coastal protection work and its foreign dredging projects generally involve capital work . in addition , the company 's dredging projects vary in duration and , in general , projects of longer duration result in less dredge downtime in a given period . story_separator_special_tag dredging segment operating income for 2012 decreased 38.9 % to $ 32.9 million , from $ 53.8 million in 2011 due to the lower gross profit described above , $ 11.7 million of gains in the prior year from sales of underutilized assets , and higher general and administrative expenses . the prior year also included $ 2.2 million of amortization of intangibles from the matteson acquisition that were fully amortized by the current year and partially offset the higher expenses . demolition segment operating loss was $ 17.4 million for 2012 down from an operating income in 2011 of $ 0.5 million due to the lower gross profit described above , which was partially offset by the recognition of $ 1.8 million of additional legal and consulting expenses in 2011 relating to the subpoenas received in april 2011 and gains on the sale of underutilized equipment . the company 's net interest expense for 2012 totaled $ 20.9 million compared with $ 21.7 million in 2011. this decrease is primarily due to the company 's issuance of $ 250 million of 7.375 % senior notes and the related redemption of the company 's $ 175 million of 7.75 % senior subordinated notes in the 2011 first quarter . due to timing requirements , both of these note issuances were outstanding and accruing interest for approximately 30 days in 2011 , resulting in duplicative interest expense of approximately $ 1.1 million . in addition , in 2012 the company realized a $ 0.1 million gain on interest rate swaps , while 2011 included a $ 0.4 million gain . income tax expense in 2012 was a benefit of $ 2.1 million compared to a provision of $ 9.5 million in 2011. this $ 11.6 million decrease is primarily the result of the decrease in the company 's operating income . the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 , 2012 was 38.3 % compared to 35.4 % for the year ended december 31 , 2011 . 42 for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , net loss attributable to great lakes dredge & dock corporation was $ 2.7 million compared to net income attributable to great lakes dredge & dock corporation of $ 16.5 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011. this $ 19.2 million decrease was primarily driven by the lower operating income , net of taxes in 2012 as described above . adjusted ebitda ( as defined above ) was $ 60.9 million and $ 93.7 million for the years ended december 31 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively . the decrease of $ 32.8 million , or 35.0 % , is related to the decrease in dredging segment and demolition segment operating income described above . in 2012 , the company recorded $ 40.0 million of depreciation and amortization expense that is included as a component of operating income , but is excluded for the purposes of calculating adjusted ebitda . the depreciation and amortization expense recorded in 2011 was $ 40.8 million . during 2012 , the company incurred $ 4.7 million of accelerated maintenance expenses related to preparation of vessels for the wheatstone project in australia that are recognized in the company 's operating income . the company does not frequently incur significant accelerated maintenance as a part of its international deployments . we have therefore excluded these accelerated maintenance expenses from the calculation of adjusted ebitda . year ended december 31 , 2011 compared to year ended december 31 , 2010 revenues from domestic capital dredging projects of $ 156.3 million in 2011 decreased $ 144.6 million , or 48.1 % , from 2010 revenues of $ 300.9 million . the decrease in revenue is primarily due to $ 108.3 million of revenue in 2010 that did not repeat in 2011 from work on sand berm construction off the coast of louisiana in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico . in addition , 2010 revenue benefited from $ 56 million for deepening projects in the ports of new jersey that were not repeated in 2011. revenues from coastal protection projects of $ 135.2 million in 2011 increased $ 29.0 million , or 27.3 % , from $ 106.2 million in 2010. the company won $ 198 million of coastal protection projects in 2011 , which is $ 143 million higher than the amount of projects won in 2010. the significant increase in coastal protection awards created a larger supply of projects in backlog , of which the company was able to convert a portion into revenue for projects worked in 2011. additionally , revenue was positively impacted as the company was able to work on projects which were not subjected to environmental windows , which are limitations as to the timing of when dredging activity can occur , unlike the prior year when such projects were not available . revenues from maintenance dredging projects in 2011 were $ 116.0 million , a decrease of $ 3.0 million , or 2.5 % , from $ 119.0 million in 2010. maintenance revenue in 2011 decreased slightly as $ 4.7 million of projects traditionally included in maintenance revenue was shifted to the rivers & lakes revenue category . revenues from rivers & lakes projects were $ 35.5 million for 2011. the company purchased its rivers & lakes operations on december 31 , 2010 and therefore had no revenues from rivers & lakes projects in 2010. revenues from foreign dredging operations in 2011 totaled $ 77.2 million , a decrease of $ 5.7 million , or 6.8 % , from 2010 revenues of $ 82.9 million . in 2011 , revenues were from projects comprised of smaller values and scopes than those in the prior year . foreign revenues in 2011 also benefited from the resolution of outstanding project claims of approximately $ 3.8 million in the 2011 first quarter , offset by fewer projects in the
","Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation has expanded its demolition segment into the New York area and marine demolition markets, particularly focusing on bridge demolition across the eastern U.S. This expansion follows a 2012 acquisition that allowed the company to enter the Midwest market. The company holds 50% stakes in two joint ventures: Amboy Aggregates, which dredges sand from New York Harbor for construction and landfill, and Terrasea Environmental Solutions, which remediates contaminated soil. The company operates in two segments: dredging and demolition, with revenues primarily generated through competitive bidding. In 2012, the dredging segment's operating income fell by 38.9% to $32.9 million, while the demolition segment reported an operating loss of $17.4 million, down from a $0.5 million income in 2011. The company's net interest expense decreased to $20.9 million in 2012 from $21.7 million in 2011, attributed to the issuance of $250 million in senior notes. The net loss attributable to the company was $2.7 million in 2012, compared to a net income of $16.5 million in 2011, with adjusted EBITDA dropping 35% to $60.9 million. Revenues from domestic capital dredging projects plummeted by 48.1% to $156.3 million in 2011, largely due to a lack of repeat projects from 2010. Overall, the company faced significant fluctuations in revenue and profitability across its segments, influenced by project wins, equipment utilization, and market conditions."
21,"this focus led to the continuing increase in unifi 's pva sales as a percentage of its overall sales , with net sales from pva products representing approximately 45 % of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018. this increase continues a growth trend in pva sales , which have risen more than 10 % annually for the past several fiscal years . unifi 's strategy of enriching its product mix through a focus on pva products helps to insulate it from the pressures of low-priced commodity yarn imports and to establish unifi as an innovation leader in its core markets . unifi 's innovative and sustainable products achieved growth in overseas markets , continuing to meet the demands of premier brands and retailers worldwide . unifi 's flagship repreve Â® brand continued as our fastest growing pva solution during fiscal 2018. the increasing success and awareness of the repreve Â® brand continues to provide new opportunities for growth , allowing for expansion into new end uses and markets for repreve Â® , as well as continued growth of the brand with current customers . both brands and consumers are demanding more sustainable solutions that provide better performance characteristics , and we believe repreve Â® is positioned to benefit from this trend . however , despite the relative growth in pva sales and overall sales , unifi experienced profitability challenges in fiscal 2018. the primary challenges related to ( i ) persistently rising raw material costs and an inherent lag in implementing responsive price increases , ( ii ) suppressed yarn demand in the polyester and nylon segments and ( iii ) a less-profitable sales mix . fiscal 2017 marked the final year of a three-year $ 135,000 capital investment plan . beginning with fiscal 2015 , unifi invested approximately $ 35,000 in capital projects , adding machinery to support expansion of its draw-textured and air-jet textured 20 businesses , launching its third production line in the repreve Â® recycling center and installing a 1-megawatt capacity solar farm . in fiscal 2016 , unifi invested approximately $ 60,000 in capital projects , including initial construction of a bottle processing facility , commencing another repreve Â® recycling center expans ion and enhancing automation systems and existing machinery to accommodate an increasingly complex product mix . unifi invested approximately $ 40,000 in capital projects in fiscal 2017 , completing construction of its bottle processing facility , nearing comp letion of the fourth production line in the repreve Â® recycling center , and completing construction of assets for production of specialized bi-component fibers , along with additional enhancements to existing assets for customized and small-lot solutions . in fiscal 2018 , we invested approximately $ 25,000 in capital projects , which included ( i ) completing the fourth production line in the repreve Â® recycling center , ( ii ) making further improvements in production capabilities and technology enhancements in the americas and ( iii ) annual maintenance capital expenditures . to appropriately leverage the significant investments made in machinery and equipment in recent years , unifi expects to make additional investments in certain growth initiatives , including technology , innovation and sustainability ; high-quality strategic partnerships ; and supply chain expansion and optimization . these initiatives complement unifi 's core competencies and are expected to strengthen our relationships with like-minded customers who value a premier supply chain and state-of-the-art equipment that offers technology-driven solutions backed by innovation and sustainability . as a result , these initiatives are expected to increase net sales , gross margins and operating income while also increasing sg & a expenses . raw material components represent a significant portion of unifi 's manufactured products . the prices for the principal raw materials used by unifi continually fluctuate , and it is difficult , and often impossible , to predict trends or upcoming developments . during fiscal 2018 and 2017 , unifi operated in a predominantly increasing raw material cost environment . unifi believes those costs were primarily a result of volatility in the crude oil markets . during fiscal 2016 , unifi operated in a predominantly declining virgin polyester raw material cost environment . unifi believes that costs during much of fiscal 2016 were impacted by lower crude oil values , a lack of major unplanned raw material capacity outages and soft global demand for polyester raw materials . the continuing volatility in global crude oil prices is likely to impact unifi 's polyester and nylon raw material costs . while it is not possible to predict the timing or amount of the impact or whether the recent fluctuations in crude oil prices will stabilize or continue , unifi monitors these dynamic factors closely . in addition , unifi attempts to pass on to its customers rises in raw material costs but at times it can not and , when it can , there typically is a time lag that adversely affects unifi during one or more periods . certain customers are subject to an index-based pricing model in which unifi 's prices are adjusted based on the change in the cost of raw materials in the prior quarter . pricing adjustments for other customers must be negotiated independently . in ordinary market conditions in which raw material price increases have stabilized and sales volumes are consistent with traditional levels , unifi has historically been successful in implementing price adjustments within one or two fiscal quarters of the raw material price increase for its index priced customers and within two fiscal quarters of the raw material price increase for its non-index priced customers . unifi is also impacted by significant fluctuations in the value of the brl and the chinese renminbi ( â€œ rmb â€ ) , the local currencies for our operations in brazil and china , respectively . appreciation of the brl and rmb improves our net sales and gross profit metrics when the results of our subsidiaries are translated into usds at comparatively favorable rates . story_separator_special_tag fiscal 2017 vs. fiscal 2016 other operating expense ( income ) , net changed favorably from $ 2,248 of expense for fiscal 2016 to $ 310 of income for fiscal 2017. other operating expense ( income ) , net for fiscal 2017 primarily includes favorable foreign currency exchange impacts , while the total for fiscal 2016 primarily includes key employee transition costs . 26 interest expense , net interest expense , net reflected the following components : replace_table_token_12_th fiscal 2018 vs. fiscal 2017 interest on debt obligations increased from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 primarily due to ( i ) a higher weighted average interest rate resulting from fixing the variable portion of the interest rate on $ 75,000 of debt principal , beginning in may 2017 and ( ii ) a general increase in market interest rates on the remaining portion of our variable rate debt . the change in other components of interest expense from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to a fiscal 2017 favorable mark-to-market adjustment for the historical interest rate swap that terminated in may 2017 and less interest capitalized to project costs . fiscal 2017 vs. fiscal 2016 interest on debt obligations increased from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 in connection with an increase in the weighted average interest rate and an increase in capital lease obligations . the change in other components of interest expense from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to a more favorable change in the mark-to-market adjustment for the historical interest rate swap . interest income in each period includes earnings recognized on cash equivalents held globally . loss on sale

nylon joint ventures experienced a decrease from the prior period primarily due to softness in the nylon market , consistent with the results of the nylon segment , as well as higher raw material costs . fiscal 2017 vs. fiscal 2016 unifi 's 34 % share of pal 's earnings decreased from $ 6,074 in fiscal 2016 to $ 2,723 in fiscal 2017. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower volumes and operating margins , mostly as a result of a challenging domestic cotton market . the earnings from the nylon joint ventures experienced a decrease from the prior period primarily due to higher raw material costs and softness in the nylon markets . 27 ( benefit ) provision for i ncome taxes the change in consolidated income taxes is as follows : replace_table_token_14_th on december 22 , 2017 , the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation h.r . 1 , formerly known as the tax cuts and jobs act . h.r . 1 includes significant changes to existing tax law , including a permanent reduction to the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and profits , deductions , credits and business-related exclusions . unifi has recorded all known and estimable impacts of h.r . 1 that are effective for fiscal 2018. future adjustments to provisional numbers will be recorded as discrete adjustments to income tax expense in the period in which those adjustments become estimable and or are finalized . unifi continues to review the anticipated impacts of the global intangible low-taxed income ( â€œ gilti â€ ) , foreign derived intangible income ( â€œ fdii â€ ) deduction , and base erosion anti-abuse tax ( â€œ beat â€ ) , which are not effective until fiscal 2019. unifi has not recorded any impacts associated with either gilti , fdii or beat , but these provisions are expected to adversely impact the fiscal 2019 effective tax rate . fiscal 2018 vs. fiscal 2017 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 benefited from , among other things , ( i ) the release of uncertain tax positions due to settlement with tax authorities , ( ii ) the deferred tax benefit resulting from the revaluation of unifi 's domestic deferred tax balances for the lower u.s. statutory rate ( including valuation allowances on domestic deferred tax assets ) , ( iii ) the release of a valuation allowance on certain nols outside the u.s. consolidated group , and ( iv ) a reduction in the valuation allowance related to foreign nols utilized in fiscal 2018. these benefits were partially offset by ( a ) the one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings , net of foreign tax credits , ( b ) withholding taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings and ( c ) nondeductible compensation . the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 benefited from , among other things , ( i ) a lower overall effective tax rate for unifi 's foreign earnings ( reflecting free-trade zone sales in el salvador and lower statutory tax rates in both brazil and china ) , ( ii ) increased research and development credits , ( iii ) a decrease in the valuation allowance reflecting the recognition of lower taxable income versus book income for unifi 's investment in pal ( for which unifi maintains a full valuation allowance ) and ( iv ) a reduction in the valuation allowance related to foreign nols utilized in 2017. these benefits were partially
","Unifi's PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) sales represented approximately 45% of its consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018, continuing a growth trend of over 10% annually in recent years. The company's strategy to enhance its product mix with PVA products has helped mitigate the impact of low-priced commodity yarn imports and positioned Unifi as an innovation leader. The RepreveÂ® brand was the fastest-growing PVA solution, driving expansion into new markets and end uses. Despite this growth, Unifi faced profitability challenges due to rising raw material costs, suppressed demand in polyester and nylon segments, and a less profitable sales mix. The company also experienced fluctuations in raw material costs, primarily influenced by crude oil market volatility. In fiscal 2018, Unifi's interest expense increased due to higher average interest rates and market conditions. Overall, Unifi's focus on sustainable and innovative products is expected to drive future growth, despite ongoing challenges in raw material pricing and market demand."

Marcellus production constituted 53.9% of E&P sales volumes, up from 52.4% in 2015, while Utica production rose to 23% from 17.1%. The E&P division experienced a decrease in lifting costs per unit due to increased sales volumes and reduced maintenance costs. The Pennsylvania mining operations division saw earnings before income tax decline to $131 million from $405 million in 2015, attributed to lower average sales prices due to a downturn in thermal coal markets, despite an increase in tons sold. The division sold 5.4 million tons on the export market, slightly down from 5.5 million tons in 2015. The other division reported a net loss of $287 million, worsening from a $77 million loss in 2015. The company recognized an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $386 million in 2016, compared to a $197 million gain in 2015. Purchased gas sales revenues surged to $43 million from $14 million, reflecting increased sales volumes. Miscellaneous other income rose to $81 million from $62 million, driven by a $13 million increase in right-of-way sales.

23,"may claim the alternative fuel mixture credit and the cellulosic biofuel producer credit in the same taxable year for different volumes of black liquor ( the same gallon of fuel can not receive both credits , but different gallons of fuel can be claimed as either the alternative fuel mixture credit or the cellulosic biofuel producer credit ) . pca received the required cellulosic biofuel producer registration code in september 2010. prior to the irs 's memoranda and guidance regarding the cellulosic biofuel producer credits , pca had recorded all tax credits resulting from black liquor production before december 31 , 2009 as alternative fuel mixture tax credits , resulting in $ 171.3 million in income in 2009 and an additional $ 9.2 million in the first quarter of 2010. based upon both irs memoranda and the 2010 guidance regarding the cellulosic biofuel producer credit , pca analyzed the additional potential benefits from claiming the cellulosic biofuel producer credit for 2009 instead of the alternative fuel mixture credit , or claiming a combination of the two credits for 2009. for the gallons of alternative fuels produced in 2009 , pca claimed about two-thirds of the gallons as cellulosic biofuel producer credits and about one-third of the gallons as alternative fuel mixture credits , resulting in additional income of $ 38.5 million in 2010 and a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $ 102.0 million . this 18 reserve relates to uncertainty concerning the proprietary biofuel process at the company 's filer city corrugating medium mill . due to the unique and proprietary nature of the filer city mill process , irs guidelines do not specifically address the process and uncertainty exists . as a result , the company recorded a $ 102.0 million reserve for uncertain tax positions under asc 740 , Â“income taxes.Â” as of december 31 , 2011 , including the $ 102.0 million recorded as an uncertain tax position under asc 740 , pca had as much as $ 167.5 million of tax credits to be used to offset future tax payments . the cellulosic biofuel producer credit is a taxable credit . however , the laws governing the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credit are not completely defined . the irs has not issued definitive guidance regarding such taxability . pca believes that the manner in which the credit was claimed will not subject the company to federal or state income taxes on such benefits . if it is determined that any of the alternative fuel mixture credits are subject to taxation , pca will be required to pay those taxes and take a corresponding charge to its net income . during the first quarter of 2011 , the company received notification that the irs will begin its review of the cellulosic biofuel producer tax credits claimed in the 2009 federal income tax return , and such review is under way . on february 3 , 2012 , pca amended its 2009 tax return to reflect a change in claimed gallons between the alternative fuel mixture credits and the cellulosic biofuel producer credits . this change is expected to result in a first quarter 2012 non-cash , after-tax charge of $ 23 million . excluding charges of $ 4.8 million , or $ 0.05 per share , for asset disposals related to major energy projects and income of $ 1.0 million , or $ 0.01 per share , for an adjustment related to medical benefits reserves , we earned net income of $ 161.8 million ( $ 1.61 per diluted share ) for the full year of 2011. this compares with $ 166.3 million ( $ 1.62 per diluted share ) for the comparable period in 2010 , excluding the income impact of the tax credits noted above of $ 47.7 million ( $ 0.46 per share ) and charges of $ 8.6 million ( $ 0.08 per diluted share ) for asset disposals related to major energy projects and other assets no longer in service and facility closure costs . management excludes the above items and uses these measures to focus on pca 's on-going operations and assess its operating performance and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results . reconciliations to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap are included elsewhere in item 7 under Â“reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to reported amounts.Â” in the first quarter of 2012 , our corrugated products shipments should be higher with four additional workdays compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 , and we also expect a full quarter 's earnings benefit from our major energy projects . we expect normal first quarter cost increases from colder weather , annual maintenance outages at our counce and valdosta mills , timing related employee benefits , a higher tax rate and pension expense . average export containerboard prices are expected to be lower reflecting the full impact of fourth quarter price changes . considering all of these items we expect first quarter earnings , excluding special items ( including the non-cash charge described above ) , to be approximately equal to reported earnings of $ 0.40 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2011 . 19 results of operations year ended december 31 , 2011 compared to year ended december 31 , 2010 the historical results of operations of pca for the years ended december 31 , 2011 and 2010 are set forth below : replace_table_token_7_th net sales net sales increased by $ 184.5 million , or 7.6 % , for the year ended december 31 , 2011 from the year ended december 31 , 2010. net sales increased primarily as a result of increased sales volumes of corrugated products and containerboard ( $ 122.6 million ) and higher sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard ( $ 61.9 million ) . story_separator_special_tag the instruments governing pca 's indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit , among other things , the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to : enter into sale and leaseback transactions , 26 incur liens , incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level , enter into certain transactions with affiliates , or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca . these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities . in addition , pca must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio under its senior revolving credit facility . a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility could lead to an event of default , which could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness and or prohibit pca from drawing on the revolving credit facility . such acceleration may also constitute events of default under the senior notes indentures and the receivables credit facility . at december 31 , 2011 , pca was in compliance with these covenants . pca currently expects to incur capital expenditures of $ 40.4 million in 2012 , primarily for maintenance capital , cost reduction , business growth and environmental compliance . pca believes that net cash generated from operating activities , cash on hand , available borrowings under its committed credit facilities and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital requirements , including payments of any declared common stock dividends , for the foreseeable future . as its debt or credit facilities become due , pca will need to repay , extend or replace such facilities . its ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial , business and other factors , many of which are beyond pca 's control . environmental matters pca is subject to , and must comply with , a variety of federal , state and local environmental laws , particularly those relating to air and water quality , waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater . the most significant of these laws affecting the company are : resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) ; clean water act ( cwa ) ; clean air act ( caa ) ; the emergency planning and community right-to-know-act ( epcra ) ; toxic substance control act ( tsca ) ; and safe drinking water act ( sdwa ) . pca believes that it is currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations . because environmental regulations are constantly evolving , the company has incurred , and will continue to incur , costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws . the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations , and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition . for the years ended december 31 , 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , we spent approximately $ 26.0 million , $ 24.6 million and $ 26.4 million , respectively , to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws . 27 additionally , total capital costs for environmental matters were $ 2.8 million , $ 1.1 million and $ 0.4 million for 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively , and the company currently estimates 2012 environmental capital expenditures will be $ 1.0 million . as is the case with any industrial operation , pca has , in the past , incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination , as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response , compensation and liability act , commonly known as the federal Â“superfundÂ” law , and analogous state laws . cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates , former facilities and off-site facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances . as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999 , pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing off-site waste disposal . pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city , michigan unrelated to current mill operations . in 2004 , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( the Â“epaÂ” ) published the boiler mact regulations , establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers . these regulations were vacated and remanded by the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit in 2007. the epa proposed final regulations in march 2011 , which would require compliance in 2014. during 2011 , the epa determined that it would reconsider certain provisions of the boiler mact regulations and , in december 2011 , the epa published proposed rules containing changes to the march 2011 rules . the epa may make further changes to the proposed rules . pca is currently assessing the impact of these regulations on its operations which could require significant modifications to certain of pca 's boilers . due to the complexity of these regulations , and the potential for additional future regulatory or judicial modification to these regulations , the timing and amount of expenditures to be made by pca are uncertain , but could be significant during the period before compliance is required . because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict , meaning that liability is imposed without fault , joint and several , meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution , and retroactive , pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material . from 1994 through 2011 , remediation costs at pca 's mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately $ 3.2 million . as of december 31 , 2011 , pca maintained an
","PCA is eligible to claim both the alternative fuel mixture credit and the cellulosic biofuel producer credit for different volumes of black liquor, but not for the same gallon. PCA received its cellulosic biofuel producer registration code in September 2010 and had previously recorded $171.3 million in tax credits from black liquor production in 2009, with an additional $9.2 million in Q1 2010. Following IRS guidance, PCA claimed approximately two-thirds of its 2009 alternative fuel gallons as cellulosic credits, resulting in an extra $38.5 million in income in 2010 and a $102 million reserve for uncertain tax positions due to proprietary processes at its Filer City mill. By December 31, 2011, PCA had $167.5 million in tax credits available for future offsets. The company amended its 2009 tax return in February 2012, anticipating a $23 million non-cash charge. For 2011, PCA reported net income of $161.8 million ($1.61 per diluted share), down from $166.3 million ($1.62 per diluted share) in 2010, with net sales increasing by $184.5 million (7.6%) due to higher sales volumes and prices. PCA expects capital expenditures of $40.4 million in 2012 and has incurred environmental compliance costs of approximately $26 million annually from 2009 to 2011. PCA's remediation costs from 1994 to 2011 totaled about $3.2 million, and it is currently assessing the impact of evolving EPA regulations on its operations."

primarily due to increased overseas office expense , offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates . the impact of foreign exchange rates was approximately three percentage points in 2012 vs. 2011. during the fourth quarter of 2012 , the company in the ordinary course of business incurred litigation settlement expense of $ 5 million related to the company 's litigation with american vehicular sciences llc ( `` avs `` ) . on june 25 , 2012 , avs filed four patent infringement complaints in the united states district court in the eastern district of texas , which named the company and one of two of its customers as co-defendants . in two of the complaints ( # 6:12-cv-00413 and # 6:12-cv-00406 ) , avs alleged that the company 's smartbeam Â® product infringed one patent owned by avs . in the other two complaints ( # 6:12-cv-00410 and # 6:12-cv-00415 ) , avs alleged that the company 's monitoring system products infringe two other patents owned by avs . the company was served with the four complaints on july 27 , 2012. on october 5 , 2012 , the company submitted its answers to all four complaints . story_separator_special_tag see the contractual obligations and other commitments below . 21 contractual obligations and other commitments the company had the following contractual obligations and other commitments ( 000,000 ) as of december 31 , 2013 . replace_table_token_8_th purchase obligations are primarily for raw material inventory and capital equipment . critical accounting policies . the preparation of the company 's consolidated financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states , requires management to make estimates , assumptions and apply judgments that affect its financial position and results of operations . on an ongoing basis , management evaluates these estimates and assumptions . management also continually reviews its ' accounting policies and financial information disclosures . the company 's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements . the policies described below represent those that are broadly applicable to its operations and involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods , assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related amounts . revenue recognition . the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc 820 , revenue recognition in financial statements . accordingly , revenue is recognized based on the terms of the customer purchase order that indicates title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon shipment . sales are shown net of returns , which have not historically been significant . the company does not generate sales from sale arrangements with multiple deliverables . accounts receivable . the company reviews a monthly aging report of all accounts receivable balances starting with invoices outstanding over sixty days . in addition , the company monitors information about its customers through a variety of sources including the media , and information obtained through on-going interaction between company personnel and the customer . based on the evaluation of the above information , the company estimates its allowances related to customer receivables on historical credit and collections experience , customers current financial condition and the specific identification of other potential problems , including the economic climate . actual collections can differ , requiring adjustments to the allowances , but such adjustments have not , historically , been material . inventories . estimated inventory allowances for slow-moving and obsolete inventories are based on current assessments of future demands , market conditions , evaluation of longer lead times for certain electronic components and related management initiatives . if market conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management , inventory allowances are adjusted accordingly . goodwill and intangible assets . goodwill represents the excess of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date . in accordance with accounting guidance related to goodwill and other intangible assets , the company will test for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter and in certain situations between those annual dates , if interim indicators of impairment arise . indefinite-lived intangible assets will be tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter , by comparing the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value using a discounted cash flow approach . intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over their useful life , which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows . management will periodically assess the amortization period of intangible assets with definite lives based upon estimated future cash flows from related operations and tests for impairment when indicators arise . given the timing of the homelink Â® acquisition , no impairment indicators arose during the year ended december 31 , 2013 which would give reason for an interim test to be performed on goodwill or intangible assets . inherent in the calculation of the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are 22 various estimates . future cash flow estimates are , by their nature , subjective , and actual results may differ materially from the company 's estimates . if the company 's ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met , the company may have to record impairment charges in future accounting periods . investments . the company 's internal investment committee regularly reviews its fixed income and equity investment portfolio for any unrealized losses that would be deemed other-than-temporary and require the recognition of an impairment loss in income . if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value , the company evaluates , among other factors , general market conditions , the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost , and the company 's intent and ability to hold the investment . management also considers the type of security , related industry , sector performance , as well as published investment ratings and analyst reports to evaluate its portfolio . once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary , an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established . if market , industry , and or investee conditions continue to deteriorate , the company may incur future impairments . self insurance . the company is self-insured for health and workers ' compensation benefits up to certain stop-loss limits . such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred , but not reported ( ibnr ) claims . ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators . this estimation process is subjective , and to the extent that future results differ from original estimates , adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary . income taxes . the company applies the provisions of asc 740 as it relates to uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the company 's consolidated financial statements . a threshold of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination is applied to uncertain tax
","In 2013, international automotive mirror unit shipments rose by 13% compared to 2012, driven by increased adoption of auto-dimming mirrors among European and Japanese automakers, despite flat vehicle production in Europe and a 4% decline in Japan/Korea. Other net sales surged by 23% to $27.9 million, with dimmable aircraft window sales increasing by 62% and fire protection sales rising by 3%. The cost of goods sold (COGS) as a percentage of net sales decreased from 66.1% in 2012 to 63.2% in 2013, attributed to product mix improvements and purchasing cost reductions, each contributing approximately 1-2 percentage points. Operating expenses saw a decrease in engineering, research, and development (R&D) costs by $8.5 million, down to 7% of net sales from 8%, while selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 2% to 4% of net sales. Investment income rose by $1.4 million, and other income increased by $6.7 million, mainly due to realized gains on equity investments. Net income grew by $54.3 million, or 32%, reflecting higher sales and gross profit. In the previous year, 2012, net sales had increased by $75.8 million, or 7%, with automotive net sales also up by 7% due to an 11% rise in auto-dimming mirror shipments from 21.5 million in 2011 to 23.8 million in 2012. North American shipments increased by 22%, while overseas shipments rose by 5%. COGS as a percentage of net sales increased from 64.7% in 2011 to 66.1% in 2012.

2019 ) to increase the size of its fleet of ships to include additional submarines and aircraft carriers beyond the number disclosed prior to september 2019. while the new administration may make further changes with its fiscal year 2022 budget submission , we have made additional capital expenditures and investments in personnel to meet this anticipated growth in demand and we expect to continue making such expenditures and investments . nuclear power group we expect the backlog of our nuclear power group segment of approximately $ 726 million at december 31 , 2020 to produce revenues of approximately $ 307 million in 2021 , not including any change orders or new contracts that may be awarded during the year . the revenues in this segment primarily depend on the demand and competitiveness of nuclear energy . the activity of this segment depends on the timing of maintenance and refueling outages , the cyclical nature of capital expenditures and major refurbishment and plant life extension projects , as well as the demand for nuclear fuel and fuel handling equipment primarily in the canadian market , which could cause variability in our financial results . our acquisition of the mi business in july 2018 expanded our nuclear power group segment 's offerings to include medical radioisotope products . the mi business will be the platform from which we plan to launch our molybdenum-99 product line and a number of future radioisotope-based imaging , diagnostic and therapeutic products . 28 nuclear services group a significant portion of this segment 's operations is conducted through joint ventures , which typically earn fees , and we account for them following the equity method of accounting . see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for financial information on our equity method investments . as a result , this segment reports minimal backlog and revenues . given our specialized capabilities of full life-cycle management of special materials , facilities and technologies , we believe our nuclear services group segment is well-positioned to participate in the continuing cleanup , operation and management of critical government-owned nuclear sites , laboratories and manufacturing complexes maintained by the doe , nasa and other federal agencies . however , it is possible that reductions in federal government spending and sequestration could have an adverse impact on the operating results and cash flows of this segment in the future . this segment also specializes in the development of advanced technologies . the nature , timing and duration of any related contracts are dependent on the demand and funding availability for such technologies . critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ( `` gaap `` ) . preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenues and expenses . these estimates and assumptions are affected by management 's application of accounting policies . we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that we apply in the preparation of our financial statements . these policies require our most difficult , subjective and complex judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain . contracts and revenue recognition . we determine the appropriate accounting method for each of our long-term contracts before work on the project begins . we generally recognize contract revenues and related costs over time for individual performance obligations based on a cost-to-cost method in accordance with fasb topic revenue from contracts with customers . we recognize estimated contract revenue and resulting income based on the measurement of the extent of progress toward completion as a percentage of the total project . certain costs may be excluded from the cost-to-cost method of measuring progress , such as significant costs for uninstalled materials , if such costs do not depict our performance in transferring control of goods or services to the customer . we review contract price and cost estimates periodically as the work progresses and reflect adjustments proportionate to the percentage-of-completion in income in the period when those estimates are revised . certain of our contracts recognize revenue at a point in time , and revenue on these contracts is recognized when control transfers to the customer . the majority of our revenue that is recognized at a point in time is related to parts and certain medical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals in our nuclear power group segment . for all contracts , if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract , the projected loss is recognized in full when determined . it is possible that current estimates could materially change for various reasons , including , but not limited to , fluctuations in forecasted labor productivity or steel and other raw material prices . we routinely review estimates related to our contracts , and revisions to profitability are reflected in the quarterly and annual earnings we report . in the years ended december 31 , 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , we recognized net favorable changes in estimates related to long-term contracts that increased operating income by approximately $ 42.8 million , $ 71.6 million and $ 46.3 million , respectively . although we continually strive to improve our ability to estimate our contract costs and profitability , adjustments to overall contract costs due to unforeseen events could be significant in future periods . we recognize contract change orders or changes in scope of work in contract revenues , to the extent of costs incurred , when we believe collection is probable and can be reasonably estimated . we recognize income from claims when formally agreed with the customer . story_separator_special_tag nuclear power group

this was primarily related to an increase in revenues of $ 38.0 million associated with the acquisition of laker energy products during the first quarter of 2020. we also experienced additional volume related to the fabrication of nuclear fuel and a higher levels of in-plant inspection , maintenance and modification services . these increases were partially offset by lower revenues in our nuclear components business largely attributable to decreased activity associated with major steam generator design and supply contracts of $ 34.2 million . in addition , we experienced lower demand for our medical radioisotopes when compared to the prior year , due to a decrease in elective diagnostic procedures caused in part by the covid-19 pandemic . operating income decreased $ 1.8 million to $ 52.0

decline in revenues due to the divestiture of our u.s.-based commercial nuclear services business during the second quarter of 2020. operating income increased $ 12.2 million to $ 26.4 million in the year ended december 31 , 2020 compared to $ 14.2 million for the corresponding period of 2019 due to the operating income impact of the changes in revenues noted above in addition to year over year

impact us more than certain of our competitors due to our strategic focus on a higher end of our market . although we have expanded our operations during periods of stagnant or modestly declining industry trends , the cyclical nature of the recreational boating industry or the lack of industry growth may adversely affect our business , financial condition , and results of operations . any period of adverse economic conditions or low consumer confidence is likely to have a negative effect on our business . historically , in periods of lower consumer spending and depressed economic conditions , we have , among other things , substantially reduced our acquisition program , delayed new store openings , reduced our inventory purchases , engaged in inventory reduction efforts , closed a number of our retail locations , reduced our headcount , and amended and replaced our credit facility . 34 although past economic conditions have adversely affected our operating results , we believe we have capitalized on our core strengths to substantially outperform the industry , resulting in market share gains . our ability to capture such market share supports the alignment of our retailing strategies with the desires of consumers . we believe the steps we have taken to address weak market conditions in the past have yielded , and will we believe yield in the future , an

the understanding of our results of operations . the impact and risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results . in the ordinary course of business , we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . we base our estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions ( including future earnings ) that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances . the results of these assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities , including contingent assets and liabilities such as contingent consideration liabilities from acquisitions , which are not readily apparent from other sources . actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions . we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies , which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult , subjective , and complex judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain . revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is from contracts with customers for the sale of boats , motors , and trailers . we recognize revenue from boat , motor , and trailer sales upon transfer of control of the boat , motor , or trailer to the customer , which is generally upon acceptance or delivery to the customer . at the time of acceptance or delivery , the customer is able to direct the use of , and obtain substantially all of the benefits of the boat , motor , or trailer at such time . we recognize commissions earned from a brokerage sale when the related brokerage transaction closes upon transfer of control of the boat , motor , or trailer to the customer , which is generally upon acceptance or delivery to the customer . we do not directly finance our customers ' boat , motor , or trailer purchases . in many cases , we assist with third-party financing for boat , motor , and trailer sales . we recognize commissions earned by us for placing notes with financial institutions in connection with customer boat financing when we recognize the related boat sales . pursuant to negotiated agreements with financial institutions , we are charged back for a portion of these fees should the customer terminate or default on the related finance contract before it is outstanding for a stipulated minimum period of time . we base the chargeback allowance , which was not material to the consolidated financial

extended warranty service contracts sold on behalf of third-party insurance companies at generally the later of customer acceptance of the service contract terms as evidenced by contract execution or recognition of the related boat sale . we also recognize variable consideration from marketing fees earned on insurance products sold by third-party insurance companies at the later of customer acceptance of the insurance product as evidenced by contract execution or when the related boat sale is recognized . we recognize revenue from parts and service operations ( boat maintenance and

our wholesale mortgage origination channel in late 2010. additionally , despite a continued low rate environment in 2011 , many borrowers refinanced mortgages in 2010. interest rates did not decrease significantly enough for borrowers to pursue another refinancing in 2011. the company recorded net interest income of $ 461.4 million in 2011 compared to $ 415.8 million and $ 311.9 million in 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the higher level of net interest income recorded in 2011 compared to 2010 resulted from an increase in average earning assets of $ 1.1 billion . this average earning asset growth was primarily a result of the $ 671.9 million increase in average loans , $ 288.3 million of average covered loan growth from the fdic-assisted bank acquisitions and a $ 169.7 million increase in liquidity management and other earning assets . growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio of $ 330.8 million , in the life insurance premium finance portfolio of $ 266.8 million and in the commercial insurance premium finance loan portfolio of $ 145.4 accounted for the majority of the total average loan growth over the past 12 months . the average earning asset growth of $ 1.1 billion over the past 12 months was primarily funded by a $ 602.6 million increase in the average balances of interest-bearing deposits and an increase in the average balance of net free funds of $ 354.7 million . non-interest income totaled $ 189.7 million in 2011 , decreasing $ 2.5 million , or 1 % , compared to 2010. the change was primarily attributable to lower bargain purchase gains recorded during the current period relating to the fdic-assisted transactions than during the comparable period as well as lower net gains on available-for-sale securities in 2011 , partially offset by higher wealth management revenues and fees from covered call options in the current period . non-interest income totaled $ 192.2 million in 2010 , decreasing $ 125.5 million , or 40 % , compared to 2009. the decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to the $ 156.0 million of bargain purchase gains recorded during 2009 related to the life insurance premium finance loan acquisition in 2009. non-interest expense totaled $ 420.4 million in 2011 , increasing $ 37.9 million , or 10 % , compared to 2010. the increase compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to a $ 22.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits . the increase in salaries and employee benefits was , in turn , attributable to an $ 18.2 million increase in salaries resulting from additional employees from acquisitions and larger staffing as the company grows and a $ 6.2 million increase in employee benefits ( primarily health plan and payroll taxes related ) , partially offset by a $ 2.4 million decrease in bonus expense and commissions attributable to variable pay based revenue . non-interest expense totaled $ 382.5 million in 2010 , increasing $ 38.4 million , or 11 % , compared to 2009. the increase compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to a $ 28.9 million increase in salaries and employee benefits . the increase in salaries and employee benefits was , in turn , attributable to a $ 12.6 million increase in bonus expense and commissions as variable pay based revenue increased ( primarily wealth management revenue and mortgage banking revenue ) , an $ 11.4 million increase in salaries resulting from additional employees from the three fdic-assisted transactions in 2010 and larger staffing as the company grows , and a $ 4.9 million increase in employee benefits ( primarily health plan and payroll taxes related ) . 36 the current economic environment the company 's results during 2011 continued to be impacted by the existing stressed economic environment and depressed real estate valuations that affected both the u.s. economy , generally , and the company 's local markets , specifically . story_separator_special_tag because of the indirect nature of this lending and because the borrowers are located nationwide , this segment is more susceptible to third party fraud than relationship lending . in the second quarter of 2010 , fraud perpetrated against a number of premium finance companies in the industry , including the property and casualty division of our premium financing subsidiary , increased both the company 's net charge-offs and provision for credit losses by $ 15.7 million . actions have been taken by the company to decrease the likelihood of this type of loss from recurring in this line of business for the company by the enhancement of various control procedures to mitigate the risks associated with this lending . the company has conducted a thorough review of the premium finance Â— commercial portfolio and found no signs of similar situations . in the second quarter of 2011 , the company recovered $ 5.0 million from insurance coverage of the $ 15.7 million fraud loss . the company continues to pursue additional recoveries , but does not anticipate any significant additional recoveries . the majority of these loans are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments . historically , fifc originations that were not purchased by the banks 39 were sold to unrelated third parties with servicing retained . however , during the third quarter of 2009 , fifc sold $ 695 million in commercial premium finance receivables to our indirect subsidiary , fifc premium funding i , llc , which in turn sold $ 600 million in aggregate principal amount of notes backed by such premium finance receivables in a securitization transaction sponsored by fifc . subsequent to december 31 , 2009 , this securitization transaction has been accounted for as a secured borrowing and the securitization entity is treated as a consolidated subsidiary of the company . accordingly , beginning on january 1 , 2010 , all of the assets and liabilities of the securitization entity have been included directly on the company 's consolidated statements of condition . the primary driver of profitability related to the financing of commercial insurance premiums is the net interest spread that fifc can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit . the commercial insurance premium finance business is a competitive industry and yields on loans are influenced by the market rates offered by our competitors . we fund these loans either through the securitization facility described above or through our deposits , the cost of which is influenced by competitors in the retail banking markets in the chicago and milwaukee metropolitan areas . financing of life insurance premiums in 2007 , fifc began financing life insurance policy premiums generally used for estate planning purposes of high net-worth borrowers . in 2009 , fifc expanded this niche lending business segment when it purchased a portfolio of domestic life insurance premium finance loans for an aggregate purchase price of $ 745.9 million . fifc originated approximately $ 469.7 million in life insurance premium finance receivables in 2011. these loans are originated directly with the borrowers with assistance from life insurance carriers , independent insurance agents , financial advisors and or legal counsel . the cash surrender value of the life insurance policy is the primary form of collateral . in addition , these loans often are secured with a letter of credit , marketable securities or certificates of deposit . in some cases , fifc may make a loan that has a partially unsecured position . similar to the commercial insurance premium finance receivables , the majority of life insurance premium finance receivables are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments . the company believes that its life insurance premium finance loans have a lower level of risk and delinquency than the company 's commercial and residential real estate loans because of the nature of the collateral . the life insurance policy is the primary form of collateral . if cash surrender value is not sufficient , then letters of credit , marketable securities or certificates of deposit are used to provide additional security . since the collateral is highly liquid and generally has a value in excess of the loan amount , any defaults or delinquencies are generally cured relatively quickly by the borrower or the collateral is generally liquidated in an expeditious manner to satisfy the loan obligation . greater than 95 % of loans are fully secured . however , less than 5 % of the loans are partially unsecured and in those cases , a greater risk exists for default . no loans are originated on a fully unsecured basis . as with the commercial premium finance business , the primary driver of profitability related to the financing of life insurance premiums is the net interest spread that fifc can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit . profitability of financing both commercial and life insurance premiums is also meaningfully impacted by leveraging information technology systems , maintaining operational efficiency and increasing average loan size , each of which allows us to expand our loan volume without significant capital investment . wealth management activities we currently offer a full range of wealth management services including trust and investment services , asset management services and securities brokerage services , through three separate subsidiaries including whi , ctc and great lakes advisors . in october 2010 , the company changed the name of its trust and investment services subsidiary , wayne hummer trust company , n.a . , to the chicago trust company , n.a . additionally , in july 2011 , the company 's asset management company , wayne hummer
","As of December 31, 2011, the company's loan portfolio, excluding covered loans, increased from $9.6 billion in 2010 to $10.5 billion, driven by a commercial banking initiative, the acquisition of Elgin State Bank, and growth in premium finance receivables. The company maintained a strong deposit base, with overnight liquid funds and interest-bearing deposits totaling $919 million, down from $1 billion in 2010. Mortgage origination volumes fell by 32% in 2011 due to a broader industry decline and the company's exit from wholesale mortgage origination. Net interest income rose to $461.4 million in 2011, up from $415.8 million in 2010, attributed to a $1.1 billion increase in average earning assets, including a $671.9 million rise in average loans. Non-interest income decreased slightly to $189.7 million, while non-interest expenses increased by 10% to $420.4 million, primarily due to a $22 million rise in salaries and employee benefits. The company also faced challenges from fraud in its premium finance segment, incurring a $15.7 million loss, partially recovered by $5 million in insurance. In 2011, the company originated approximately $469.7 million in life insurance premium finance receivables, with over 95% of loans fully secured. Wealth management services were offered through three subsidiaries, reflecting the company's diversified financial strategy."
28,"re-lock eligibility is subject to a satisfactory payment performance history by the borrower ( current at the time of re-lock , and no foreclosures or bankruptcies since the smart rate application was taken ) . in addition to a satisfactory payment history , re-lock eligibility requires that the property continues to be the borrower 's primary residence . the loan term can not be extended in connection with a re-lock nor can new funds be advanced . all interest rate caps and floors remain as originated . we also feature a ten-year , fully amortizing fixed-rate first mortgage loan in our product promotions . the ten-year , fixed-rate loan has a less severe interest rate risk profile when compared to loans with fixed-rate terms of 15 to 30 years and helps us to more effectively manage our interest rate risk exposure , yet provides our borrowers with the certainty of a fixed interest rate throughout the life of the obligation . 56 the following tables set forth our first mortgage loan production and balances segregated by loan structure at origination . replace_table_token_36_th replace_table_token_37_th the following table sets forth the balances as of september 30 , 2018 for all arm loans segregated by the next scheduled interest rate reset date . replace_table_token_38_th at september 30 , 2018 and september 30 , 2017 , mortgage loans held for sale , all of which were long-term , fixed-rate first mortgage loans and all of which were held for sale to fannie mae , totaled $ 0.7 million and $ 0.4 million , respectively . marketing home equity lines of credit since 2016 , we have actively marketed home equity lines of credit , which carry an adjustable rate of interest indexed to the prime rate which provides interest rate sensitivity to that portion of our assets . prior to 2010 , home equity lending also represented a meaningful strategy to manage our interest rate risk profile . between 2010 and 2015 , the association , in various steps , restricted and modified its home equity lending products and the markets they were offered in response to the 2008 financial crisis and the resulting regulatory environments that existed during that time . through redesigned home equity products , we believe we have re-established home equity line of credit lending as a meaningful strategy to manage our interest rate risk profile . at september 30 , 2018 , the principal balance of home equity lines of credit totaled $ 1.38 billion . our home equity lending is discussed in the preceding lending activities section of item 1. business in part i . â€” third federal savings and loan association of cleveland . 57 extending the duration of funding sources as a complement to our strategies to shorten the duration of our interest earning assets , as described above , we also seek to lengthen the duration of our interest bearing funding sources . these efforts include monitoring the relative costs of alternative funding sources such as retail deposits , brokered certificates of deposit , longer-term ( e.g . four to six years ) fixed rate advances from the fhlb of cincinnati , and shorter-term ( e.g . three months ) advances from the fhlb of cincinnati , the durations of which are extended by correlated interest rate exchange contracts . each funding alternative is monitored and evaluated based on its effective interest payment rate , options exercisable by the creditor ( early withdrawal , right to call , etc . ) , and collateral requirements . the interest payment rate is a function of market influences that are specific to the nuances and market competitiveness/breadth of each funding source . generally , early withdrawal options are available to our retail cd customers but not to holders of brokered cds ; issuer call options are not provided on our advances from the fhlb of cincinnati ; and we are not subject to early termination options with respect to our interest rate exchange contracts . additionally , collateral pledges are not provided with respect to our retail cds or our brokered cds ; but are required for our advances from the fhlb of cincinnati as well as for our interest rate exchange contracts . during the year ended september 30 , 2018 , these funding source modifications facilitated asset growth of $ 444.8 million and funded stock repurchases of $ 19.7 million and stock dividends of $ 37.6 million . other interest rate risk management tools we also manage interest rate risk by selectively selling a small portion of our long-term , fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market . prior to fiscal 2010 , this strategy was used to a greater extent to manage our interest rate risk . at september 30 , 2018 , we serviced $ 1.93 billion of loans for others , of which $ 1.01 billion were sold in the secondary market prior to fiscal 2010. while the sales of first mortgage loans remain strategically important for us , since fiscal 2010 , they have played only a minor role in our management of interest rate risk . loan sales are discussed later in this part i1 , item 7. under the heading liquidity and capital resources , and in part i1 , item 7a . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk . monitoring and limiting our credit risk . while , historically , we had been successful in limiting our credit risk exposure by generally imposing high credit standards with respect to lending , the confluence of unfavorable regional and macro-economic events that culminated in the 2008 housing market collapse and financial crisis , coupled with our pre-2010 expanded participation in the second lien mortgage lending markets , significantly refocused our attention with respect to credit risk . story_separator_special_tag this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates by management that may be susceptible to significant change based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions . the evaluation is comprised of a specific component and a general component . the specific component relates to loans that are delinquent or otherwise identified as a problem loan through the application of our loan review process and our loan grading system . all such loans are evaluated individually , with principal consideration given to the value of the collateral securing the loan . the general component of the evaluation is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan , risk weighting ( if applicable ) and payment history . we also analyze historical loss experience , delinquency trends , general economic conditions and geographic concentrations . quantitative loss factors used in determining an appropriate allowance level are supplemented by more qualitative factors that impact potential losses . qualitative factors include various market conditions , such as collateral values and unemployment rates . this analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general component of the allowance for loan losses . actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established , which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results . income taxes . we consider accounting for income taxes a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation . we use the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities . we must assess the realization of the deferred tax asset and , to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely , a valuation allowance is established . adjustments to increase or decrease existing valuation allowances , if any , are charged or credited , respectively , to income tax expense . at september 30 , 2018 , no valuation allowances were outstanding . even though we have determined a valuation allowance is not required for deferred tax assets at september 30 , 2018 , there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in the future . pension benefits . the determination of our obligations and expense for pension benefits is dependent upon certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts . key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets . actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may fluctuate . significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions could materially affect future pension obligations and expense . comparison of financial condition at september 30 , 2018 and 2017 total assets increased $ 444.8 million , or 3 % , to $ 14.14 billion at september 30 , 2018 from $ 13.69 billion at september 30 , 2017 . this

renovated central pacific plaza headquarters building and flagship main branch , and the launch of a new brand design in early january 2021. basis of presentation management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements under `` part ii , item 8. financial statements and supplementary data . `` covid-19 pandemic the ongoing novel coronavirus disease ( `` covid-19 `` ) pandemic has caused significant disruption in the local , national and global economies and financial markets . the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities . continuation and further spread of covid-19 could cause additional quarantines , shutdowns , reductions in business activity and financial transactions , labor shortages , supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability . in response to the anticipated economic effects of covid-19 , the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( the `` frb `` ) has taken a number of actions that have significantly affected the financial markets in the united states , including actions intended to result in substantial decreases in market interest rates . on march 3 , 2020 , the 10-year treasury yield fell below 1.00 % for the first time , and the frb reduced the target federal funds range by 50 basis points to 1.00 % to 1.25 % . on march 15 , 2020 , the frb further reduced the target federal funds range by 100 basis points to 0 % to 0.25 % and announced a $ 700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by covid-19 . on march 22 , 2020 , the frb announced that it would continue its quantitative easing program in amounts necessary to support the smooth functioning of markets for treasury securities and agency mbs . we expect that these reductions in interest rates , among other actions of the frb and the federal government generally , especially if prolonged , could adversely affect our net interest income , margins and profitability . in the december 2020 meeting , the frb elected to hold the target federal funds rate at 0 % to 0.25 % and officials expects rates to remain near zero through 2023. in late march 2020 , the coronavirus aid , relief and economic security ( â€œ cares â€ ) act was signed into law as an over $ 2 trillion economic stimulus package . the cares act is intended to prevent a severe economic downturn through various measures , including direct financial aid to american families and economic stimulus to significantly impacted industry sectors . in december 2020 , congress passed another $ 900 billion aid package , or the consolidated appropriations act , 2021 , which extends certain relief provisions under the cares act . hawaii 's economy continues to be significantly impacted by covid-19 . on march 4 , 2020 , hawaii governor david ige issued a proclamation declaring a state of emergency to support ongoing state and county responses to covid-19 . since then , governor ige issued seventeen supplemental emergency proclamations which includes travel restrictions and other measures . as a result of these restrictions , the spread of covid-19 has been relatively contained . the infection rate in the state of hawaii is one of the lowest per capita in the country at 1,816 cases per 100,000 population . as of february 8 , 2021 the centers for disease control and prevention reported there were 26,500 cases ( 7-day moving average of 75.9 new infections ) and 418 covid-19-related deaths in hawaii . during the first quarter of 2020 , in response to governor ige 's statewide restrictions on the movements of hawaii residents and visitors to combat the potential spread of covid-19 in hawaii , the company announced it would temporarily close certain branch locations . the decision to temporarily close the branches was made to protect the health and well-being of the company 's employees and customers . some branches , such as the in-store branches with limited floor space , made it challenging to operate with social distancing in mind . the staff from the temporarily closed branches were redeployed to work at the remaining branches or assist other areas of the bank . the company quickly responded to the changing environment by executing its business continuity plan and the majority of our support staff , even at the executive level , were working remotely on a full-time or rotating basis . the company continues to prudently manage through the pandemic and has put in place preventative measures including face masks , plexiglass shields , social distancing and enhanced cleaning . the company is implementing a gradual , phased-in return-to-office plan that includes a portion of the workforce continuing with flexible , remote work schedules .

, the company recorded a reserve on the accrued interest receivable of loans on active forbearance or deferral totaling $ 0.2 million , with the offset recorded to provision for credit losses . this reserve remained unchanged as of december 31 , 2020. the company may need to increase this reserve or reverse accrued interest receivable which may negatively impact interest income in future periods if it is determined that the accrued interest receivable is uncollectible . additional loan modifications to capitalize interest and or extend loan terms may also be necessary . the company anticipates requests for new or extended loan deferrals will continue at a slower pace through the first quarter of 2021. credit following the recovery from the great recession , the company believes it has implemented a disciplined approach to credit that includes tighter underwriting standards with a focus on making quality loans and maintaining a diversified loan portfolio . the company 's loan portfolio today is diversified by product and by industry . in march 2020 , the company reviewed its entire commercial loan portfolio and actively reached out to its customers to determine the initial impact , if any , of covid-19 on their businesses . the review continued throughout the remainder of 2020. the company proactively worked with many of its customers in providing loan payment deferrals as well as assisted in the application and approval of ppp loans . the volume of loan payment deferrals granted peaked in may at approximately $ 605 million in total loan balances , and has since declined to $ 120.2 million , or 2.4 % of total loans ( or 2.6 % of total loans , excluding ppp loans ) , at december 31 , 2020. the company continues to support its consumer and residential customers

and construction loan portfolios , loans on active payment deferral totaled $ 47.5 million at december 31 , 2020 , compared to $ 325.4 million at june 30 , 2020. the two highest exposures by industry are real estate and rental and leasing totaling approximately $ 33 million , or less than 1 % of the total loan portfolio excluding ppp loans , and accommodation totaling approximately $ 8 million , or less than 1 % of the total loan portfolio excluding ppp loans . the majority of the loans in the real estate category are supported by low loan-to-value ratios . the company expects some of its borrowers will need a loan modification at the end of their second loan payment deferral , which will be handled on a case-by-case basis . 43 in the fourth quarter of 2020 , we continued our stepped-up assessment and monitoring as well as our outreach to our customers . criticized loans at december 31 , 2020 increased by $ 111.9 million from the previous year to $ 192.3 million , or 4.2 % of the total loan portfolio excluding ppp loans . special mention loans increased by $ 103.5 million to $ 142.5 million , or 3.1 % of the total loan portfolio excluding ppp loans . classified loans increased by $ 8.3 million to $ 49.8 million , or 1.1 % of the total loan portfolio excluding ppp loans . the loan downgrades were the result of our continued assessment of borrower risk based on the borrower 's near-term strategy and outlook , management strength and actions they 've taken , overall financial condition , and external funding and deferral support . approximately 12 % of special mention balances and 5 % of classified balances also received ppp loans . the company believes that the residential , home equity and commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios are lower risk . the weighted average loan-to-values at origination in these portfolios are 62 % , 63 % , and 61 % , respectively , and we believe they will be less impacted by the pandemic . these loans comprise of $ 3.52 billion or 77.5 % of our total loan portfolio , net of ppp loans . overall , the company 's loan portfolio remains well diversified . the disruptions in the economy resulting from the covid-19 pandemic has impaired and will continue to impair the ability of some of our borrowers to make their monthly loan payments , which could result in significant increases in delinquencies , defaults , foreclosures and declining collateral values . as a result , the covid-19 pandemic could result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increase our allowance for

Despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, the company executed its rise2020 initiative, culminating in the grand opening of a renovated headquarters and flagship branch in January 2021. The pandemic led to significant economic disruptions, with the Federal Reserve reducing the target federal funds rate to 0% to 0.25% and initiating a $700 billion quantitative easing program. By December 2020, Hawaii had reported 26,500 COVID-19 cases and 418 deaths, with an infection rate of 1,816 cases per 100,000 population. The company temporarily closed certain branches in response to state restrictions, managing to redeploy staff and implement remote work. As of December 31, 2020, the company had $119.3 million in active loan deferrals due to COVID-19, with total loan payment deferrals peaking at $605 million in May 2020 and declining to $120.2 million (2.4% of total loans) by year-end. The company recorded a reserve of $0.2 million for accrued interest on loans in forbearance.   The ongoing pandemic is expected to impact borrowers' ability to make payments, potentially leading to increased delinquencies and credit losses."
30,"46 since 2011 , we have followed the accounting standards codification ( asc ) for revenue recognition - multiple-element arrangements , if applicable , to determine the recognition of revenue under license and collaboration agreements . the terms of these agreements generally contain multiple elements , or deliverables , which may include ( i ) licenses to our intellectual property , ( ii ) materials and technology , ( iii ) pharmaceutical supply , ( iv ) participation on joint development or joint steering committees , and ( v ) development services . the payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following : up-front license fees ; funding of research and or development efforts ; amounts due upon the achievement of specified milestones ; manufacturing and royalties on future product sales . the asc provides guidance relating to the separation of deliverables included in an arrangement into different units of accounting and the allocation of consideration to the units of accounting . the evaluation of multiple-element arrangements requires management to make judgments about ( i ) the identification of deliverables , ( ii ) whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship , ( iii ) the estimated selling price of each deliverable , and ( iv ) the expected period of performance for each deliverable . to determine the units of accounting under a multiple-element arrangement , we evaluate certain separation criteria , including whether the deliverables have stand-alone value , based on the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement . the selling prices of deliverables under an arrangement may be derived using vendor specific objective evidence ( vsoe ) , third-party evidence , or a best estimate of selling price ( besp ) , if vsoe or third-party evidence is not available . for most pharmaceutical licensing and collaboration agreements , besp is utilized . the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the element within the agreement was sold on a standalone basis . establishing besp involves our judgment and considers multiple factors , including market conditions and company-specific factors , including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements , as well as internally developed models that include assumptions related to market opportunity , discounted cash flows , estimated development costs , probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the agreement . in validating the besp , we consider whether changes in key assumptions used to determine the besp will have a significant effect on the allocation of the arrangement consideration between the multiple deliverables . the allocated consideration for each unit of accounting is recognized over the related obligation period in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition criteria . if there are deliverables in an arrangement that are not separable from other aspects of the contractual relationship , they are treated as a combined unit of accounting , with the allocated revenue for the combined unit recognized in a manner consistent with the revenue recognition applicable to the final deliverable in the combined unit . payments received prior to satisfying the relevant revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets and recognized as revenue when the related revenue recognition criteria are met . we typically receive up-front payments when licensing our intellectual property , which often occurs in conjunction with a research and development agreement . we recognize revenue attributed to the license upon delivery , provided that the license has stand-alone value . revenues from development milestones are accounted for in accordance with the revenue recognition Â– milestone method topic of the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) asc ( milestone method ) . milestones are recognized when earned , as evidenced by written acknowledgment from the collaborator or other persuasive evidence that the milestone has been achieved , provided that the milestone event is substantive . a milestone event is considered to be substantive if its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and our efforts led to the achievement of the milestone or the milestone was due upon the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance . we assesses whether a milestone is substantive at the inception of each agreement . for payments payable on achievement of milestones that do not meet all of the conditions to be considered substantive , we recognize the portion of the payment allocable to delivered items as revenue when the specific milestone is achieved , and the contingency is removed . 47 prior to the revised multiple element guidance described above , adopted by us on january 1 , 2011 , upfront , nonrefundable payments for license fees , grants , and advance payments for sponsored research revenues received in excess of amounts earned were classified as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the contract or development period . mitsubishi tanabe pharma corporation ( mitsubishi tanabe ) . on march 31 , 2015 , we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with mitsubishi tanabe for the development and commercialization of nbi-98854 ( valbenazine ) for movement disorders in japan and other select asian markets . payments to us under this agreement include an up-front license fee of $ 30 million , up to $ 85 million in development and commercialization event-based payments , payments for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products , and royalties on product sales in select territories in asia . under the terms of the agreement , mitsubishi tanabe is responsible for all third-party development , marketing and commercialization costs in japan and other select asian markets with the exception of a single huntington 's chorea clinical trial to be performed by us , at an estimated cost of approximately $ 12 million , should mitsubishi tanabe request the clinical trial . story_separator_special_tag higher market research , licensing and other professional fees accounted for approximately $ 1.9 million of the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2014 to 2015. the $ 4.7 million increase in expenses from 2013 to 2014 resulted primarily from a $ 3.5 million increase in personnel related costs , of which $ 1.7 million was related to higher share-based compensation costs . higher market research and professional fees accounted for $ 0.6 million of the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2013 to 2014. we expect our general and administrative expenses in 2016 to increase significantly from 2015 expense levels due to increasing pre-commercialization activities related to our vmat2 inhibitor for tardive dyskinesia . net loss our net loss for 2015 was $ 88.9 million , or $ 1.05 net loss per common share , our net loss for 2014 was $ 60.5 million , or $ 0.81 net loss per common share , and our net loss for 2013 was $ 46.1 million , or $ 0.69 net loss per common share . the increase in our net loss from 2014 to 2015 was a result of the above mentioned higher overall expenses offset partially by an increase in revenue of approximately $ 19.8 million from the mitsubishi tanabe agreement . the increase in our net loss from 2013 to 2014 was a result of the above mentioned higher overall expenses coupled with a $ 2.9 million decrease in revenue . 52 we expect to have a net loss in 2016 , primarily due to significantly higher general and administrative expenses as we prepare for commercialization of valbenazine in tardive dyskinesia . r & d expenses will also increase due to our expanded clinical pipeline and early stage r & d efforts . revenue is also expected to decrease modestly in 2016. story_separator_special_tag each drug candidate that successfully completes all stages of r & d , and is commercialized , total r & d spending in the pharmaceutical industry may exceed $ 2 billion . additionally , the stages of research and development can take in excess of ten years to complete for each drug candidate . we test our potential product candidates in numerous preclinical studies to identify disease indications for which our product candidates may show efficacy . we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate . as we obtain results from trials , we may elect to discontinue clinical trials 54 for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications . the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol , including , among others , the following : we or the fda or similar foreign regulatory authorities may suspend the trials ; we may discover that a product candidate may cause harmful side effects ; patient recruitment may be slower than expected ; and patients may drop out of the trials . for each of our programs , we periodically assess the scientific progress and merits of the programs to determine if continued r & d is economically viable . certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization . because of the uncertainties associated with r & d of these programs , we may not be successful in achieving commercialization . as such , the ultimate timeline and costs to commercialize a product can not be accurately estimated . our product candidates have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval , which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products in the united states . in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval , the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy . we must satisfy the requirements of similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries in order to market products in those countries . the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later clinical trials . it is possible for a candidate to show promising results in clinical trials , but subsequently fail to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals . as a result of the uncertainties discussed above , among others , the duration and completion costs of our r & d projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation . our inability to complete our r & d projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements , when appropriate , could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity . these uncertainties could force us to seek additional , external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy . our inability to raise additional capital , or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us , would jeopardize the future success of our business . we also may be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other areas of our business . in particular , our future capital requirements will depend on many factors , including : continued scientific progress in our r & d programs ; the magnitude of our r & d programs ; progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials ; the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals ; the costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications and enforcing patent claims ; competing technological and market developments ; the establishment of additional collaborations and strategic alliances ; developments related to on-going litigation ; the cost of manufacturing facilities and of commercialization activities and arrangements ; and the cost of product in-licensing and any possible acquisitions . we believe that our existing capital resources ,
","Since 2011, the company has adhered to the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) for revenue recognition, particularly for multiple-element arrangements in license and collaboration agreements. These agreements typically involve various deliverables, including licenses, materials, technology, and development services, with payments comprising up-front fees, milestone payments, and royalties. The company evaluates deliverables based on criteria such as stand-alone value and estimated selling prices, often using Best Estimate of Selling Price (BESP) when vendor-specific evidence is unavailable. For instance, a collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, initiated on March 31, 2015, includes a $30 million up-front license fee and up to $85 million in milestone payments, alongside royalties on product sales. The company reported a net loss of $88.9 million in 2015, up from $60.5 million in 2014, attributed to increased expenses, despite a revenue increase of approximately $19.8 million from the Mitsubishi Tanabe agreement. General and administrative expenses rose significantly, driven by pre-commercialization activities for the VMAT2 inhibitor for tardive dyskinesia. The company anticipates further net losses in 2016 due to rising expenses and modest revenue decreases. R&D spending in the pharmaceutical industry can exceed $2 billion, with drug development taking over ten years. The company faces uncertainties in R&D timelines and costs, which could necessitate additional financing to sustain operations."
31,"in the short-term , however , management anticipates the company will continue to be negatively impacted by loan losses above historical averages , continuing high levels of nonperforming assets , a weak economy , and modest reductions in total assets and revenues . critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the financial services industry . application of these principles requires us to make estimates , assumptions , and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes . these estimates , assumptions , and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements ; accordingly , as this information changes , the financial statements could reflect different estimates , assumptions , and judgments . certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates , assumptions , and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported . our most significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements . these policies , along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review , provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined . based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods , assumptions , and estimates underlying those amounts , we have identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses , the valuation of goodwill , fair value measurements , and other real estate owned ( â€œ oreo â€ ) valuations to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments , and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available . allowance for loan losses : the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio . determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans , estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience , and consideration of current economic trends and conditions , all of which may be susceptible to significant change . the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on our consolidated balance sheet . to the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates , additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would negatively impact earnings in future periods . note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality section of this financial review . goodwill : goodwill is subject to a two-step impairment test by reporting unit at least annually to determine whether write-downs of the recorded balances are necessary . during the third quarter , we completed the required annual impairment test for 2011 for each of our reporting units , community banking and insurance services . the first step ( step 1 ) of impairment testing requires a comparison of each reporting unit 's fair value to its carrying value to identify potential impairment . if the fair value equals or exceeds the related unit 's carrying value , no write-down of recorded goodwill is necessary . if the fair value is less than the carrying value , an expense may be required on our books to write down the goodwill to the proper carrying value . the second step ( step 2 ) of impairment testing is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass step 1. step 2 compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit . the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination . the fair value , carrying amount and allocated goodwill with regard to each of our reporting units as of september 30 , 2011 ( date of our most recent goodwill impairment test ) were as follows : dollars in thousands community banking insurance services fair value $ 164,235 $ 6,929 carrying amount 132,845 6,414 allocated goodwill 1,488 4,710 neither of our reporting units failed step 1 of the goodwill impairment tests conducted as of september 30 , 2011. for purposes of these goodwill impairment tests , the following methodologies were utilized and key assumptions were made in determining the fair value of each reporting unit : 27 community banking â€“ we performed an internal valuation utilizing the income approach to determine the fair value of our community banking reporting unit . the income approach was based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of balances sheet and income statement activity based upon an internally developed forecast considering several long-term key business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth . the long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value was estimated at 3.5 % , and a discount rate of 11 % based upon the capital asset pricing model was applied to the bank 's estimated future cash flow streams . insurance services â€“ we performed an internal valuation , which was verified by a third party firm , utilizing the income approach to determine the fair value of our insurance services reporting unit . this methodology consisted of discounting the expected future cash flows of this unit based upon a forecast of its operations considering long-term key business drivers such as anticipated commission revenue growth . story_separator_special_tag we have slowed our loan growth due to the current weakened economic conditions in our market areas and limited availability of new capital resources . refer to note 5 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our loan maturities and a discussion of our adjustable rate loans as of december 31 , 2011. in the normal course of business , we make various commitments and incur certain contingent liabilities , which are disclosed in note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements but not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements . there have been no significant changes in these types of commitments and contingent liabilities and we do not anticipate any material losses as a result of these commitments . securities securities comprised approximately 19.7 % of total assets at december 31 , 2011 compared to 18.4 % at december 31 , 2010. average securities approximated $ 316,795,000 for 2011 or 7.9 % more than 2010 's average of $

issues as they arise . pursuant to asc topic 320 investmentsâ€”debt and equity securities , anytime that we carry a security with an unrealized loss that has been determined to be â€œ other-than-temporary â€ , we must recognize that loss in income . during 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , we took other-than-temporary non-cash impairment charges of $ 2.6 million , $ 1.0 million and $ 5.4 million , respectively , related to certain nongovernment sponsored residential mortgage-backed securities . at december 31 , 2011 , we had $ 1.6 million in unrealized losses related to residential mortgage backed securities issued by nongovernment sponsored entities . we monitor the performance of the mortgages underlying these bonds . although there has been some deterioration in collateral performance , we hold primarily senior tranches of each issue which provides protection against defaults . we attribute the unrealized loss on these mortgage backed securities largely due to their current absence of liquidity . we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until their fair value recovers or until maturity . the mortgages in these asset pools have been made to borrowers with acceptable credit history and significant equity invested in their homes . they are well diversified geographically . nonetheless , significant further weakening of economic fundamentals coupled with significant increases in unemployment and substantial deterioration in the value of high end residential properties could extend distress to this borrower population . this could increase default rates and put additional pressure on property values . should these conditions occur , the value of these securities could decline further and trigger the recognition of additional other-than-temporary impairment charges . at december 31 , 2011 , we did not own securities of any one issuer that were not issued by the u.s. treasury or a u.s. government agency that exceeded ten percent of shareholders ' equity . the maturity distribution of the securities portfolio at december 31 , 2011 , together with the weighted average yields for each range of maturity , is

This decline was primarily attributed to reduced sales in Europe ($215,000) and the U.S. ($189,000), partially offset by an increase in Asia of approximately $94,000. The cost of sales rose from $3,769,879 to $3,809,785, marking an increase of $39,906, with the cost of sales as a percentage of sales increasing from 65.1% to 68.5%. Selling, general, and administrative costs remained stable, slightly decreasing from $1,845,789 to $1,837,787 (0.4% increase). Research and development expenses surged by 23.7% to $1,398,368, up from $1,130,635, driven by costs related to potential FDA clearance for new gastrointestinal products. Interest expense remained unchanged at $37, while interest and dividend income rose from $46,354 to $47,764. The company established a valuation allowance of $1,549,000 against deferred tax assets due to recent losses and ongoing R&D plans.

33,"we believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a reit under the code , and that our current intended manner of operation enables us to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes . our portfolio the following table outlines the carrying value of our portfolio of mortgage loan assets and single-family and smaller commercial properties as of december 31 , 2018 and december 31 , 2017 ( $ in millions ) : 43 replace_table_token_4_th we closely monitor the status of our mortgage loans and , through our servicer , work with our borrowers to improve their payment records . market trends and outlook we believe that certain cyclical trends continue to drive a significant realignment within the mortgage sector . these trends and their effects include : historically low interest rates and elevated operating costs resulting from new regulatory requirements that continue to drive sales of residential mortgage assets by banks and other mortgage lenders ; â€‹ declining home ownership due to rising prices , low inventory and increased down payment requirements that have increased the demand for single-family and multi-family residential rental properties ; â€‹ rising home prices are increasing homeowner equity and reducing the incidence of strategic default ; â€‹ rising prices have resulted in millions of homeowners being in the money to refinance ; â€‹ the dodd-frank risk retention rules for asset backed securities have reduced the universe of participants in the securitization markets ; â€‹ the lack of a robust market for non-conforming mortgage loans in the aftermath of the financial crisis â€‹ ; and continuing increases in interest rates will result in lower refinancing volume and home prices increases will slow . the current market landscape is also generating new opportunities in residential mortgage-related whole loan strategies . the origination of subprime and alternative residential mortgage loans remain substantially below 2008 levels and the qualified mortgage and ability-to-repay rule requirements have put pressure on new originations . additionally , many banks and other mortgage lenders have increased their credit standards and down payment requirements for originating new loans . the combination of these factors has also resulted in a significant number of families that can not qualify to obtain new residential mortgage loans . we believe the u.s. federal regulations addressing â€œ qualified mortgages â€ based , among other factors on employment status , debt-to-income level , impaired credit history or lack of savings , limit mortgage loan availability from traditional mortgage lenders . in addition , we believe that many homeowners displaced by foreclosure or who either can not afford to own or can not be approved for a mortgage will prefer to live in single-family rental properties with similar characteristics and amenities to owned homes as well as smaller multi-family residential properties . in certain demographic areas , new households are being formed at a rate that exceeds the new homes being added to the market , which we believe favors future demand for non-federally guaranteed mortgage financing for single-family and smaller multi-family rental properties . for all these reasons , we believe that demand for single-family and smaller multi-family rental properties will increase in the near term and remain at heightened levels for the foreseeable future . we also believe that banks and other mortgage lenders have strengthened their capital bases and are more aggressively foreclosing on delinquent borrowers or selling these loans to dispose of their inventory . additionally , many npl buyers are now interested in reducing their investment duration and have begun selling rpls . we believe that investments in residential rpls with positive equity provide an optimal investment value . as a result , we are currently focusing on acquiring pools of rpls , though we may acquire npls , either directly or with joint venture partners , if attractive opportunities exist . through our servicer , we work with our borrowers to improve their payment records . once there is a period of continued performance , we expect that borrowers will typically refinance these loans at or near the estimated value of the underlying property . 44 we also believe there are significant attractive investment opportunities in the sbc loan and property markets and originate as well as purchase these loans , particularly in urban areas where there is a sustainable trend of young adults desiring to live near where they work . we focus on densely populated urban areas where we expect positive economic change based on certain demographic , economic and social statistical data . the primary lenders for smaller multi-family and mixed retail/residential properties are community banks and not regional and national banks and large institutional lenders . we believe the primary lenders and loan purchasers are less interested in these assets because they typically require significant commercial and residential mortgage credit and underwriting expertise , special servicing capability and active property management . it is also more difficult to create the large pools that these primary banks , lenders and portfolio acquirers typically desire . we continually monitor opportunities to increase our holdings of these sbc loans and properties . factors that may affect our operating results acquisitions . our operating results depend heavily on sourcing residential rpls and sbc loans and , when attractive opportunities are identified , npls . we believe that there is generally a large supply of rpls available to us for acquisition and we believe the available supply provides for a steady acquisition pipeline of assets since large institutions are active sellers in the market . we expect that our residential mortgage loan portfolio may grow at an uneven pace , as opportunities to acquire distressed residential mortgage loans may be irregularly timed and may involve large portfolios of loans , and the timing and extent of our success in acquiring such loans can not be predicted . story_separator_special_tag an individual loan is considered to be impaired when , based on current events and conditions , it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due ( both principal and interest ) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement . impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan 's effective interest rate , the loan 's market price , or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent . for individual loans , a troubled debt restructuring is a formal restructuring of a loan where , for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower 's financial difficulties , a concession that would not otherwise be considered is granted to the borrower . the concession may be granted in various forms , including providing a below-market interest rate , a reduction in the loan balance or accrued interest , an extension of the maturity date , or a combination of these . an individual loan that has had a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be impaired and is subject to the relevant accounting for impaired loans . loans are tested quarterly for impairment and impairment reserves are recorded to the extent the net realizable value of the underlying collateral falls below net book value . if necessary , an allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses . the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible , based on evaluations of the collectability of loans . real estate reo property â€” we acquire real estate properties directly from sellers and when we foreclose on a borrower and take title to the underlying property ( reo ) . reo is recorded at cost if purchased , or at the present value of future cash flows if obtained through foreclosure . reo we expect to actively market for sale is classified as held-for-sale . reo held-for-sale is carried at the lower of its acquisition basis , or its net realizable value ( estimated fair market value less expected selling costs ) . we estimate fair market value using a combination of bpos , comparable sales , appraisals , and competitive market analyses provided by local realtors subject to our judgment . net unrealized losses due to changes in market value are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income . no depreciation or amortization expense is recognized on properties held-for-sale , while holding costs are expensed as incurred . foreclosed property that is sold to a third party at the foreclosure sale ( â€œ third party sales â€ ) is not considered reo and proceeds on these third party sales are treated as payment in satisfaction of the underlying loan . see mortgage loans . rental reo is reo not held-for-sale . rental reo is intended to be held as long-term investments but may eventually be held-for-sale . reo is held for investment as rental property if the modeled present value of the future expected cash flows from use as a rental exceed the present value of expected cash flows from a sale . depreciation is provided for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets of three to 39 years . we perform an impairment analysis for all rental reo not held-for-sale using estimated cash flows if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired , such as prolonged vacancy , identification of materially adverse legal or environmental factors , changes in expected ownership period or a decline in market value to an amount less than cost . this analysis is performed at the property level . the cash flows are estimated based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including , among others , demand for rental properties , competition for customers , changes in market rental rates , costs to operate each property and expected ownership periods . if the carrying amount of a held-for-investment asset exceeds the sum of its undiscounted future operating and residual cash flows , an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between estimated fair value of the asset and the carrying amount . we generally estimate the fair value of assets held for use by using bpos , comparable sales or realtor competitive market analysis . in some instances , appraisal information may be available and is used in addition to other measures of fair value . from time to time , we perform property renovations to maximize the value of reo held for sale and held for investment . such expenditures are generally advanced by our servicer and recovered by our servicer when the property is liquidated ( for reo property held for sale ) or upon completion of the renovations ( for reo property held for investment ) . for residential and commercial properties that are not held for sale , the carrying value , including any renovations that improve or extend the life of the asset , are accounted for at cost . the cost basis is depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three to 39 years . interest and other carrying costs incurred during the renovation period are capitalized until the property is ready for its intended use . expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred . we generally intend to limit rental activity to multifamily or multi-unit single family properties . investments at fair value our investments at fair value as of december 31 , 2018 consist of investments in senior and subordinate notes issued by joint ventures which we form with third party institutional partners . we recognized income on the debt securities using the effective interest method . additionally , the debt securities are classified as available for sale and
","As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio includes mortgage loan assets and single-family and smaller commercial properties, with a carrying value of $X million, reflecting a strategic alignment with REIT qualification requirements for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are actively monitoring mortgage loans and collaborating with borrowers to enhance payment records. Current market trends indicate a significant realignment in the mortgage sector, driven by historically low interest rates, rising home prices, and increased demand for rental properties due to declining home ownership. The Dodd-Frank risk retention rules have limited participants in the securitization markets, while many banks have tightened credit standards, resulting in a substantial number of families unable to secure new residential mortgages. We anticipate increased demand for single-family and smaller multi-family rental properties, particularly in urban areas where young adults prefer to live near work. Our focus is on acquiring residential real estate loans (RPLs) and potentially non-performing loans (NPLs) when attractive opportunities arise. We believe that the supply of RPLs is robust, providing a steady acquisition pipeline. Our operating results are contingent on sourcing these loans, and we regularly assess loans for impairment, establishing reserves as necessary. Additionally, we acquire real estate owned (REO) properties through foreclosure, which are recorded at cost or present value of future cash flows. We expect to actively market REO properties for sale, while also holding some as long-term investments. Our investments at fair value include senior and subordinate notes from joint ventures, with income recognized using the effective interest method. Overall, we are positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the residential mortgage and rental property markets, with a focus on urban demographics and economic trends."
34,"competition and market factors . as some products can be packaged in different types of materials , the company 's sales are affected by competition from other manufacturers ' cuk , crb , sbs , folding box board , and recycled clay-coated news . additional substitute products also include plastic , shrink film and corrugated containers . in addition , while the company has long-term relationships with many of its customers , the underlying contracts may be re-bid or renegotiated from time to time , and the company may not be successful in renewing on favorable terms or at all . the company works to maintain market share through efficiency , product innovation and strategic sourcing to its customers ; however , pricing and other competitive pressures may occasionally result in the loss of a customer relationship . in addition , the company 's sales historically are driven by consumer buying habits in the markets its customers serve . changes in consumer dietary habits and preferences , increases in the costs of living , unemployment rates , access to credit markets , as well as other macroeconomic factors , may negatively affect consumer spending behavior . new product introductions and promotional activity by the company 's customers and the company 's introduction of new packaging products also impact its sales . debt obligations . the company had an aggregate principal amount of $ 2,967.7 million of outstanding debt obligations as of december 31 , 2018 . this debt has consequences for the company , as it requires a portion of cash flow from operations to be used for the payment of principal and interest , exposes the company to the risk of increased interest rates and may restrict the company 's ability to obtain additional financing . covenants in the company 's amended and restated credit agreement , the term loan credit agreement and indentures may , among other things , restrict the ability of the company to dispose of assets , incur guarantee obligations , prepay other indebtedness , repurchase stock , pay dividends , make other restricted payments and make acquisitions or other investments . the amended and restated credit agreement and the term loan credit agreement also require compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio . the company 's ability to comply in future periods with the financial covenants will depend on its ongoing financial and operating performance , which in turn will be subject to many other factors , many of which are beyond the company 's control . see â€œ covenant restrictions â€ in â€œ financial condition , liquidity and capital resources â€ for additional information regarding the company 's debt obligations . the debt and the restrictions under the amended and restated credit agreement , the term loan credit agreement and the indentures could limit the company 's flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures . the outstanding debt obligations and the restrictions may also leave the company more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or its business , or unable to carry out capital expenditures that are necessary or important to its growth strategy and productivity improvement programs . 24 overview of results this management 's discussion and analysis contains an analysis of net sales , income from operations and other information relevant to an understanding of the company 's results of operations . on a consolidated basis : net sales in 2018 increased by $ 1,619.3 million or 36.8 % , to $ 6,023.0 million from $ 4,403.7 million in 2017 due to the nacp combination , the 2017 and 2018 acquisitions discussed below , higher selling prices , and favorable foreign currency exchange rates . income from operations in 2018 increased by $ 130.3 million or 39.7 % , to $ 458.2 million from $ 327.9 million in 2017 due to the nacp combination , the 2017 and 2018 acquisitions , the higher selling prices , gain on sale of assets , and cost savings through continuous improvement and other programs . these increases were partially offset by higher inflation and the augusta , georgia mill outage . acquisitions and dispositions on september 30 , 2018 , the company acquired substantially all the assets of the foodservice business of letica foodservice , a producer of paperboard-based cold and hot cups and cartons . the acquisition included two facilities located in clarksville , tennessee and pittston , pennsylvania . letica foodservice is included in

2018 , the company had capital spending of $ 365.2 million for improving process capabilities , $ 27.6 million for capital spares and $ 16.4 million for manufacturing packaging machinery . 32 environmental matters some of the company 's current and former facilities are the subject of environmental investigations and remediations resulting from historical operations and the release of hazardous substances or other constituents . some current and former facilities have a history of industrial usage for which investigation and remediation obligations may be imposed in the future or for which indemnification claims may be asserted against the company . also , closures or sales of facilities may necessitate further investigation and may result in remediation at those facilities . the company has established reserves for those facilities or issues where liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable . for further discussion of the company 's environmental matters

In 2018, net sales increased by $1,619.3 million (36.8%) to $6,023.0 million, driven by acquisitions, higher selling prices, and favorable currency rates. Income from operations rose by $130.3 million (39.7%) to $458.2 million.

terminal ( `` cmt `` ) during periods of low api2 index prices . by late 2016 , the api2 index price had rebounded , resulting in the elimination of the new rebate incentive should prices stay at or above the year end level . the improvement in the api2 index price also improved the profitability of our customers ' coal exports and resulted in a significant increase in volumes through cmt during the fourth quarter 2016. our coal logistics ' domestic coal customers were also challenged with lower coal prices throughout most of 2016 as well as mild weather conditions , driving down volumes across the segment . we responded by aggressively managing costs , primarily at kanawha river terminals , llc ( `` krt `` ) , to partially mitigate the impacts of these lower volumes . the domestic metallurgical coal markets remained challenged during early 2016 as the drastic and sustained decline in coal prices led to several coal producers filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . despite our own diligent efforts to reduce costs by rationalizing our mining footprint , this challenged environment was likely to prevent us from generating positive cash flow from our mining operations for the foreseeable future . as a result , we divested our coal mining business in april 2016 and entered into a coal supply agreement whereby the buyer , revelation energy , llc ( `` revelation `` ) , will supply approximately 300,000 tons of coal to our jewell cokemaking facility annually for five years at a market rate . the delivered cost , as compared to alternative coal sources , is favorable due to the proximity of the jewell cokemaking facility to the mines . we believe this divestiture will improve our long-term cash flow and allow us to focus on our core cokemaking and coal logistics businesses . while conditions across the coal and steel industries have significantly improved in the second half of 2016 , we are committed to remaining flexible and responsive to the evolving industry landscape . delivered operational excellence despite facing challenging headwinds upon entering 2016 , we remained committed to delivering strong performance across our operations and achieved consolidated adjusted ebitda of $ 217.0 million . we also remained committed to maintaining a safe work environment and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations , and in 2016 , we again achieved top-tier safety ratings in our coke and coal logistics operations . domestic coke performance contributed adjusted ebitda results of $ 193.9 million , reflecting approximately 4 million tons of coke sales and adjusted ebitda of approximately $ 49 per ton during 2016 , in line with our revised guidance of $ 48 to $ 53 per ton . sales tons reflect our agreement to reduce production at our haverhill facility by 75 thousand tons , for which we were made whole by ak steel . results for 2016 also reflect record performance at our middletown facility . despite below-target production , our indiana harbor cokemaking facility 's adjusted ebitda improved by approximately $ 4 million in 2016 , reflecting our success in controlling costs . our coal logistics segment delivered adjusted ebitda of $ 63.9 million and was impacted by lower than anticipated throughput tons across the segment . cmt contributed $ 50.5 million , within our guidance of $ 50 million to $ 55 million , reflecting the strength of its take-or-pay contracts . the disposal of our coal mining business mitigated continued losses in the business , resulting in adjusted ebitda losses of $ 6.0 million versus our 2016 guidance of losses of approximately $ 20 million . progressed towards stabilizing our indiana harbor cokemaking operations through an engineering study in prior years , we identified major refurbishment work that was necessary to preserve the production capacity of our indiana harbor facility . we completed the resulting refurbishment project in the first half of 2014. while the original refurbishment improved overall plant condition , further work remained to stabilize plant performance . beginning in 2015 , we implemented an initiative to rebuild oven interiors using a comprehensive , holistic approach . in 2016 , we continued improvement efforts and evaluate the performance of the rebuilt ovens with the overall goal of stabilizing daily production and increasing efficiency . in total , we have implemented our holistic oven rebuild approach on approximately one third of the entire indiana harbor facility in 2015 and 2016 and expect the project to continue through 2018 . 39 to date , the rebuilt ovens have continued to produce stable results , including sustained performance in charge weights and coking times . however , despite the improved performance of our rebuilt ovens , we continue to experience operational disruptions , driven primarily by higher-than-expected oven degradation across the non-rebuilt ovens . we will continue to monitor the progress of all ovens and implement lessons learned into the rebuilds , including the oven rebuilds we intend to complete in 2017 and 2018 , to address critical oven conditions and combat this degradation . by the end of 2018 we expect approximately half of the facility 's ovens will be rebuilt . in 2016 , adjusted ebitda and production levels at our indiana harbor facility fell short of expectations , resulting in an adjusted ebitda loss of approximately $ 3 million versus our original guidance of earning adjusted ebitda of $ 3 million to $ 13 million . these results reflect an acceleration of our oven rebuild plan , substantially increasing the number of ovens rebuilt in 2016 , as well as expanded scope of the rebuild work performed , which resulted higher than anticipated expenses as well as below target production . story_separator_special_tag in june 2015 , the plan settled its obligations by purchasing annuities using plan assets , which triggered settlement accounting and resulted in a non-cash loss of 43 $ 12.6 million recorded in cost of products sold and operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations . india equity method investment . as a result of market conditions , we recorded impairment charges of $ 19.4 million and $ 30.5 million related to our equity method investment in visa suncoke during 2015 and 2014 , respectively , included in loss from equity method investment on the consolidated statements of operations . the 2015 impairment brought our investment in visa suncoke to zero , and consequently , we no longer

replace_table_token_7_th ( 1 ) see year-over-year changes described in `` items impacting comparability . `` total revenues . the decrease in total revenues in 2016 and 2015 primarily reflects the pass-through of lower coal prices in our domestic coke segment as well as lower sales volumes in both our domestic coke and coal logistics segments , excluding the contributions of cmt . these decreases were partly offset by the contributions from cmt of $ 62.7 million and $ 28.6 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively . cost of products sold and operating expenses . the decrease in cost of products sold and operating expense in 2016 and 2015 was primarily the result of reduced coal costs in our domestic coke segment . additionally , black lung charges of $ 9.8 million and $ 14.3 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively , were recorded in costs of products sold and operating expenses . beginning in 2016 , black lung charges were recorded in selling , general and administrative expenses rather than cost of products sold and operating expenses as previously discussed in `` items impacting comparability . `` selling , general and administrative expenses . the increase in selling , general and administrative expense in 2016 was primarily driven by $ 8.1 million of black lung charges . prior to 2016 , black lung charges were included in costs of products sold and operating expenses as discussed in â€œ items impacting comparability . â€ the remaining increase was driven by unfavorable fair value adjustments in deferred compensation as a result of changes in the company 's share price and partnership 's unit price as well as the absence of a $ 4.0 million postretirement benefit plan curtailment gain recognized in 2015. the decrease in selling , general and administrative expense in 2015 was primarily driven by higher severance charges recorded in 2014 related to our coal mining business as well as favorable fair value adjustments in deferred compensation as a result of changes in the company 's share price and partnership 's unit price and employee related savings realized in 2015 previously discussed â€œ items impacting comparability . â€ depreciation and amortization expense . the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 and 2015 was driven by the depreciation of cmt assets of $ 14.8 million and $ 5.4 million , respectively . cmt depreciation was mostly offset by lower depreciation of our coal mining assets , which decreased as a result of impairments to our asset base in 2014 as 45 well as the ultimate disposal of our assets in 2016. depreciation and amortization expense in each year was also impacted by revisions to the remaining useful lives of certain assets , primarily related to oven rebuilds at our indiana harbor cokemaking facility as well as the wind down of operations at of our former coal preparation plant , which resulted in additional depreciation of $ 13.7 million , $ 15.1 million and $ 16.6 million , or $ 0.17 , $ 0.21 and $ 0.21 per common share from operations , during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively . see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements . income taxes . the company 's effective tax rate for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was 12.7 % , ( 38.0 ) % , and 46.8 % , respectively . the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35 percent for all years presented primarily due to the impact of earnings attributable to noncontrolling ownership interests in partnerships . the effective tax rates are not comparable for the years presented due to the income tax benefit reported in 2015 related to the insolvency of a subsidiary and the impairment of our coal operations in 2014. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements . noncontrolling interest . income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the common public unitholders ' interest in suncoke energy partners , l.p. as well as a third-party interest in our indiana harbor cokemaking facility . comparability between all periods was impacted by improved performance at the partnership in 2016 , driven by gains in connection with the partnership 's de-levering activities , contributions of cmt and changes in our ownership in our facilities previously discussed in `` items impacting comparability . `` results of reportable business segments we report our business results through four segments : domestic coke consists of our jewell coke company , l.p. ( `` jewell `` ) , indiana harbor coke company ( `` indiana harbor `` ) , haverhill coke company llc ( `` haverhill `` ) , gateway energy and coke company , llc ( `` granite city `` ) and middletown coke company , llc ( `` middletown `` ) cokemaking and heat recovery operations located in vansant , virginia ; east chicago , indiana ; franklin furnace ,
","In 2016 and 2017, rebates were introduced to incentivize coal shipments through the Convent Marine Terminal (CMT) during periods of low API2 index prices, which phased out as prices rose. By late 2016, the API2 index price had improved, eliminating the rebate incentives and enhancing profitability for coal exports, leading to increased volumes through CMT in Q4 2016. Despite challenges from low coal prices and mild weather affecting domestic coal volumes, the company managed costs effectively, particularly at Kanawha River Terminals, LLC (KRT). The domestic metallurgical coal market faced significant declines, prompting several producers to file for bankruptcy. Consequently, the company divested its coal mining business in April 2016, entering a five-year coal supply agreement for 300,000 tons annually with Revelation Energy, LLC. In 2016, the company achieved a consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $217 million, with domestic coke performance contributing $193.9 million from approximately 4 million tons of coke sales. CMT generated $50.5 million in adjusted EBITDA, while the coal logistics segment reported $63.9 million, despite lower throughput. The Indiana Harbor facility's adjusted EBITDA fell short of expectations, resulting in a loss of approximately $3 million. The company also recorded impairment charges of $19.4 million related to its equity method investment in Visa Suncoke. Overall, the company focused on operational excellence, achieving top-tier safety ratings and managing costs effectively amidst a challenging market environment."

assumed the related lease which expires in 2026 and has four , five-year extension options . rent payments under the lease are approximately $ 360,000 per year and increase by approximately 15 % as each option is exercised . the opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre-opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel , excess kitchen costs , costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre-opening period and during a post-opening â€œ shake out â€ period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally . the amount of such pre-opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened . our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year , which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry . to achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons , we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants . there can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened , particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us , thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity . we may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable , when they occur , depending upon the availability of financing and other factors . recent restaurant dispositions as of december 29 , 2018 , the company determined that it would not be able to operate durgin-park profitably due to decreased traffic at the faneuil hall marketplace in boston , ma , where it was located , and rising labor costs . as a result , included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended october 3 , 2020 are losses on

) write-offs of prepaid and other expenses in the amount of $ 52,000. the restaurant closed on january 12 , 2019. on april 2 , 2020 , the company advised the landlord of a catering space in new york , ny that we would be terminating the lease . in connection with this notification , the company recorded a loss of $ 364,000 at march 28 , 2020 , consisting of rent accrued in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease , the write-off of the unamortized balance of purchased leasehold rights , our security deposit and the net book value of fixed assets . on november 13 , 2020 ,
","the company has suspended 16 future dividend payments and delayed all non-essential capital expenditures due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Approximately $15 million in loans were secured under the Paycheck Protection Program as part of the CARES Act. The company reported revenues of approximately $7.49 million and an operating loss of $7.8 million for the fiscal year ending October 3, 2020, compared to an operating income of $3.25 million the previous year. The company owned and operated 20 restaurants and bars, along with 17 fast food concepts, primarily in the U.S. The closure of Durgin-Park resulted in a loss of $1.1 million, including $721,000 in trademark impairment. The company also incurred a $364,000 loss from terminating a lease in New York. As of December 1, 2020, the company acquired Blue Moon Fish Company for $2.75 million, financed by $1.75 million in cash and a $1 million note. The lease for this restaurant is approximately $360,000 annually, with a 15% increase for each five-year extension.

consumption for the fourth quarter of 2016 at 96.9 million barrels per day ( â€œ b/d â€ ) an increase of 1.3 million b/d , or 1.4 % , over the same quarter in 2015. the estimate for global oil consumption for all of 2016 is 96.3 million b/d , an increase of 1.4 % over 2015. oecd demand in 2016 is estimated to have increased by 0.4 % to 46.6 million b/d , while non-oecd demand is estimated to have increased by 2.5 % to 49.7 million b/d . global oil production in the fourth quarter of 2016 reached 97.0 million b/d , unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2015. opec crude oil production continued to achieve record levels averaging 33.1 million b/d in the fourth quarter of 2016 , an increase of 0.5 million b/d from the third quarter of 2016 , and 0.9 million b/d from the fourth quarter of 2015. non-opec production growth , decreased by 1.0 million b/d to 57.0 million b/d in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. after declining from peak production in 2015 , oil production in the u.s. increased by 0.1 million b/d from 12.3 million b/d in the third quarter of 2016 to 12.4 million b/d in the fourth quarter of 2016 . 38 international seaways , inc. u.s. refinery throughput decreased by about 0.1 million b/d to 18.8 million b/d in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with the comparable quarter in 2015. u.s. crude oil imports increased by about 0.7 million b/d in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with the comparable quarter of 2015 with imports from opec countries increasing by 0.3 million b/d , an 11.8 % increase from the comparable quarter in 2015. chinese imports of crude oil continued increasing , with 2016 showing a 13.6 % increase from 2015 as a result of increased strategic or commercial reserve buildup and increased imports by privately owned refineries . december imports reached 8.6 million b/d . during the fourth quarter of 2016 , the international flag tanker fleet of vessels over 10,000 deadweight tons ( â€œ dwt â€ ) increased by 6.9 million dwt as the crude fleet increased by 5.5 million dwt , while the product carrier fleet expanded by 1.4 million dwt . year over year , the size of the tanker fleet increased by 31.3 million dwt with the largest increases in the vlccs , mrs and aframax sectors . during the fourth quarter of 2016 , the international flag crude tanker orderbook decreased by 6.1 million dwt , and the product carrier orderbook decreased by 1.7 million dwt . from the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 through the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 , the total tanker orderbook declined by 28.6 million dwt . due to a combination of vessel deliveries combined with a large reduction in new orders placed in 2016 , although 2016 saw limited amounts of scrappings . vlcc freight rates saw a strengthening during the fourth quarter of 2016 , reaching a peak of around $ 63,000 per day in december before beginning to decrease to around $ 50,000 per day by the end of the quarter . this was attributable to the record chinese imports experienced during the quarter . other crude segments had similar earnings patterns , although the panamax sector saw continuous improvement throughout the quarter and product carriers also improved during the quarter from a low of around $ 6,500 per day in october to around $ 13,000 per day by the end of the quarter . the previously announced opec-led production cuts will begin to impact the tanker markets during the first quarter of 2017. in addition , 2017 will likely see the peak of the orderbook delivery schedule . the combination of these factors could put downward pressure on freight rates . results from vessel operations during 2016 , income from vessel operations decreased by $ 170,373 to $ 5,941 from $ 176,314 in 2015. this decrease reflects the impact of declining tce revenues , net vessel impairment charges of $ 79,242 recorded in 2016 , and the incurrence of spin-off and severance related costs in 2016. such impacts were partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses in the 2016 period . tce revenues decreased in 2016 by $ 90,745 , or 19 % , to $ 385,045 from $ 475,790 in 2015. the decrease was principally as a result of ( i ) a weakening in rates in the mr , vlcc and aframax sectors , which accounted for $ 106,558 of the overall decrease and ( ii ) a decrease in mr revenue days , which accounted for $ 4,667 of the overall decrease , and reflects the sale of a 1998-built mr in july 2015 as well as the redelivery of an mr to its owners at the expiry of its time charter in march 2015. these negative factors were partially offset by increased revenue days in the vlcc and aframax fleets due to fewer drydock and repair days , which accounted for a $ 11,623 increase in revenue , along with a $ 5,242 increase in revenue resulting from the company 's ulcc being taken out of lay-up in the first quarter of 2015. during 2015 , income from vessel operations improved by $ 171,710 to $ 176,314 from $ 4,604 in 2014. this increase reflects the impact of a significant strengthening of tce revenues , declining charter hire expense , and decreases in depreciation and amortization , severance and technical management transition costs and story_separator_special_tag while comparable costs are not expected in 2017 , both parties will perform a true up of final separation costs which may result in additional costs being allocated to insw in 2017. insw and osg also entered into a transition services agreement ( the â€œ tsa â€ or â€œ transition services agreement â€ ) pursuant to which both parties agreed to provide each other with specified services for a limited time to help ensure an orderly transition following the distribution . the transition services agreement specifies the calculation of the costs for these services . pursuant to the terms of the agreement , osg will provide certain administrative services , including administrative support services related to benefit plans , human resources and legal services , for a transitional period after the spin-off . similarly , insw has agreed to provide certain limited transition services to osg , including services relating to accounting activities and information and data provision services . the transition services agreement will terminate 30 days after the expiration or termination of all of the services provided thereunder , which are generally provided for a maximum period of three to six months . insw expects to earn fees totaling $ 79 for services provided to osg pursuant to the terms of the transition services agreement , over the term of the tsa . approximately $ 27 of such fees were earned as of december 31 , 2016. insw also expects to incur fees totaling $ 156 during the term of the tsa for services received from osg . approximately $ 31 of such fees were incurred as of december 31 , 2016 . 43 international seaways , inc. equity in income of affiliated companies during 2016 , equity in income of affiliated companies decreased by $ 28,710 to $ 16,849 from $ 45,559 in 2015. this decrease reflects impairment charges of $ 30,475 recorded in 2016 in relation to the company 's investment in the fso joint ventures . partially offsetting such decrease was a $ 1,829 increase in earnings from the fso joint ventures resulting from lower interest expense associated with changes in the mark-to-market valuation of the interest rate swap covering the fso africa 's original debt and lower outstanding debt principal amounts . the increased earnings generated by the fso joint ventures , also reflect in part , scheduled increases in charter out rates and lower vessel operating expenses . during 2015 , equity in income of affiliated companies increased by $ 7,687 to $ 45,559 from $ 37,872 in 2014. this increase was principally as a result of the following : ( i ) a net increase in revenue earned by the lng joint venture as a result of a 40-day reduction in offhire days during the year ended december 31 , 2015 compared with 2014 , which reflected repairs to one of the joint venture 's vessels , partially offset by a reserve for performance claims made by the charterer ; ( ii ) a $ 2,200 reimbursement received from the lng joint venture 's charterer during 2015 for costs incurred by the joint venture related to establishing an inventory of ship spare parts ; and ( iii ) a decrease in interest expense associated with a $ 78,442 reduction in outstanding lng and fso joint venture debt during 2015. in addition , there was an increase in earnings generated by the fso joint ventures , reflecting , in part , scheduled increases in charter out rates combined with lower vessel operating expenses . interest expense the components of interest expense are as follows : replace_table_token_9_th interest expense was $ 39,476 in 2016 compared with $ 42,970 in 2015. the decrease in interest expense in the current year reflects the impact of the company 's repurchases and prepayments of $ 152,754 in aggregate principal amount of the insw term loan in 2016. interest expense is expected to decrease further in 2017 as a result of the principal prepayments and open market repurchases made during 2016. refer to note 9 , â€œ debt â€ to the company 's consolidated financial statements as set forth in item 8 , â€œ financial statements and supplementary data â€ for additional information . interest expense , including amortization of issuance and deferred financing costs , commitment , administrative and other fees , was $ 42,970 in 2015 and was comprised primarily of $ 42,688 relating to the insw facilities . interest expense in 2014 was $ 56,258 , including $ 17,085 associated with the insw facilities . the balance of interest expense recognized during 2014 represented contractual post-petition interest from the petition date through the effective date of the equity plan on allowed claims associated with our pre-reorganized insw loan agreements of $ 32,015 and certain rejected executory contracts . accordingly , interest expense for the year ended december 31 , 2014 is not comparable to either 2016 or 2015. income tax expense the provisions for income taxes for the years ended december 31 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were $ 440 , $ 140 and $ 744 , respectively , resulting from operations in certain foreign jurisdictions which are subject to income tax . if we do not qualify for an exemption pursuant to section 883 , or the â€œ section 883 exemption , â€ of the u.s.

interest income increased $ 15.5 million to $ 284.2 million during 2016 , as compared to $ 268.7 million in 2015 , primarily due to growth in average loans combined with increases in yields earned on interest earning assets and a shift in the mix of interest earning assets from lower-yielding cash deposits in banks and investment securities into higher-yielding loans . also contributing to the increase in net fte interest income during 2016 , as compared to 2015 , was a shift in the mix of deposits away from higher costing time deposits into lower costing demand and savings deposits . interest accretion related 38 to the fair valuation of acquired loans contributed $ 6.3 million of interest income during 2016. net fte interest income was also positively impacted by recoveries of

","As of December 31, 2016, the financial and bank holding company headquartered in Billings, Montana, reported consolidated assets of $9.1 billion, deposits of $7.4 billion, loans totaling $5.5 billion, and total stockholders' equity of $983 million. The company operates 80 banking offices across 45 communities in Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota, offering a range of banking products and services through its subsidiary, FIB. The primary income sources include interest from loans and non-interest fees, while principal expenses consist of interest on deposits, operating costs, and provisions for loan losses. The loan portfolio includes real estate, consumer, commercial, and agricultural loans, with a focus on core deposits for funding. In 2016, net FTE interest income increased by $15.5 million to $284.2 million, driven by loan growth and improved yields, while the net interest margin ratio rose to 3.57%. The company recorded a provision for loan losses of $10 million in 2016, up from $6.8 million in 2015, reflecting loan growth and increased charge-offs. Notably, the company announced the acquisition of Cascade Bancorp for approximately $628 million, which will expand its assets to over $12 billion and its geographic reach to include Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Additionally, the acquisition of Flathead Bank was completed for $34 million, adding $254 million in assets."
41,"accordingly , our revenues are heavily dependent upon the prices of , and demand for , oil and natural gas . oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future . our operating costs are generally comprised of several components , including costs of field personnel , insurance , repair and maintenance costs , production supplies , fuel used in operations , transportation costs , workover expenses and state production and ad valorem taxes . like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies , we face the constant challenge of replacing our reserves . although in the past we have offset the effect of declining production rates from existing properties through successful acquisition and drilling efforts , there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offset production declines or maintain production at current rates through future acquisitions or drilling activity . our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add new reserves in excess of production . our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal , state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for , and the development , production and transportation of , oil and natural gas , and operating safety . future laws or regulations , any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations and financial condition . applicable environmental regulations require us to remove our equipment after production has ceased , to plug and abandon our wells and to remediate any environmental damage our operations may have caused . the present value of the estimated future costs to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells and to dismantle and remove our production facilities is included in our reserve for future abandonment costs , which was $ 18.0 million as of december 31 , 2012 . 45 results of operations year ended december 31 , 2012 compared to year ended december 31 , 2011 our operating data for 2011 and 2012 is summarized below : replace_table_token_19_th ( 1 ) includes realized gains from derivatives of $ 9.8 million in 2012 . ( 2 ) includes ad valorem taxes . ( 3 ) represents depreciation , depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties only . oil and gas sales . our oil and gas sales decreased $ 2.5 million ( 1 % ) in 2012 to $ 431.9 million from sales of $ 434.4 million in 2011. our oil production in 2012 increased by 175 % while our natural gas production decreased by 9 % from our 2011 production levels . on an equivalent unit basis , our production in 2012 increased by 1 % over 2011. our successful drilling program grew our oil production which offset the decline in natural gas production . prices realized for oil sales increased by 1 % in 2012 as compared to 2011 while the average price we realized for natural gas sales decreased by 36 % in 2012 as compared to 2011. our oil hedging program generated $ 9.8 million in realized gains in 2012. including the results of our hedging program , our average oil price in 2012 of $ 101.18 increased 6 % above last year 's average price . production taxes . production taxes increased $ 10.3 million or 282 % to $ 14.0 million in 2012 from $ 3.7 million in 2011. the increase in 2012 is due to the significant growth in our oil sales during the year . much of our natural gas sales in 2011 and 2012 qualify for exemption from state production taxes . gathering and transportation . gathering and transportation costs in 2012 decreased $ 1.2 million ( 4 % ) to $ 27.3 million as compared to $ 28.5 million in 2011 due to the lower natural gas volumes that we produced in north louisiana in 2012. lease operating expenses . our lease operating expenses , including ad valorem taxes , of $ 60.6 million in 2012 were $ 14.0 million or 30 % higher than our operating expenses of $ 46.6 million in 2011. our lease operating expense per mcfe produced increased by 29 % to $ 1.06 per mcfe in 2012 as compared to $ 0.82 per mcfe in 2011. the increase mainly reflects our growing oil production . our oil wells are typically more costly to operate than our natural gas wells . oil production comprised 14 % of our total production in 2012 as compared to 5 % in 2011. exploration expense . we incurred $ 61.4 million in exploration expense in 2012 as compared to $ 10.1 million in 2011. exploration expense in 2012 consisted of $ 61.3 million of impairments of 46 unevaluated leasehold costs and $ 0.1 million for the acquisition of seismic data . our 2011 exploration cost consisted of $ 9.8 million of impairments of unevaluated leasehold costs and $ 0.3 million for the acquisition of seismic data . depreciation , depletion and amortization expense ( Â“dd & aÂ” ) . dd & a of $ 365.3 million was an increase of $ 74.5 million ( 26 % ) over dd & a of $ 290.8 million in 2011. our dd & a rate per mcfe produced averaged $ 3.83 in 2012 as compared to $ 3.00 for 2011. the increase in dd & a primarily resulted from increased development costs per mcfe associated with the oil wells drilled in 2012 , and the substantial decline in our proved natural gas reserves due to the low natural gas prices in 2012. impairment of oil and gas properties . story_separator_special_tag utilization of $ 36.9 million of our u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards is limited to approximately $ 1.1 million per year pursuant to a prior change of control of an acquired company and a valuation allowance of $ 23.0 million has been established for the estimated u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards that will not be utilized . realization of the remaining u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards requires comstock to generate taxable income within the carryforward period . a valuation allowance of $ 288.0 million has been established against our louisiana state net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of generating taxable income in the state of louisiana prior to the expiration of the carryforward period . our federal income tax returns for the years subsequent to december 31 , 2007 remain subject to examination . our income tax returns in major state income tax jurisdictions remain subject to examination for various periods subsequent to december 31 , 2007. we currently believe that our significant filing positions are highly certain and that all of our significant income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained upon audit or the final resolution would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements . therefore , we have not established any significant reserves for uncertain tax positions . interest and penalties resulting from audits by tax authorities have been immaterial and are included in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations . critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and use assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenues or expenses . successful efforts accounting . we are required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies . there are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities . the full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with finding oil and natural gas reserves , including certain general and administrative expenses . the successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration projects . costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive oil and gas reserves were not found . we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas activities and we do not capitalize any of our general and administrative expenses . oil and natural gas reserve quantities . the determination of depreciation , depletion and amortization expense is highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties . the determination of whether impairments should be recognized on our oil and gas properties is also dependent on these estimates , as well as estimates of probable reserves . reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that can not be precisely measured . the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data , production history and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment . because all reserve 52 estimates are to some degree imprecise , the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered , production and operating costs , the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas prices may all differ materially from those assumed in these estimates . the information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties . thus , such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year 's estimates . such revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities , production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices . any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition , our borrowing ability , our future prospects and the value of our common stock . impairment of oil and gas properties . we evaluate our properties on a field area basis for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable . if impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the asset 's carrying value to its undiscounted expected future net cash flows , then it is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value . a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events . expected future cash flows are determined using estimated future prices based on market based forward prices applied to projected future production volumes . the projected production volumes are based on the property 's proved and risk adjusted probable oil and natural gas reserve estimates at the end of the period . the estimated future cash flows that we use in our assessment of the need for an impairment are based on market prices for oil and natural gas for the next three years , with a 5 % escalation of prices for subsequent years . prices are not escalated to levels that exceed observed historical market prices . costs are also assumed to escalate at a rate that is based on our historical experience , currently estimated at 2 % per annum . the oil and natural gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows because the standardized measure requires the use of the average first day of the month historical price for the year . to the extent
","As of December 31, 2012, the company reported oil and gas sales of $431.9 million, a slight decrease of $2.5 million (1%) from $434.4 million in 2011. Oil production surged by 175%, while natural gas production fell by 9%, leading to a 1% overall increase in production on an equivalent unit basis. The average realized price for oil rose by 6% to $101.18 per barrel, while natural gas prices plummeted by 36%. Production taxes skyrocketed by 282% to $14 million due to increased oil sales. Lease operating expenses rose by 30% to $60.6 million, with costs per thousand cubic feet equivalent (mcfe) increasing from $0.82 to $1.06. Exploration expenses surged to $61.4 million, primarily due to $61.3 million in impairments. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expenses increased by 26% to $365.3 million, with a DD&A rate of $3.83 per mcfe. The company also reported a reserve for future abandonment costs of $18 million. The valuation allowance for net operating loss carryforwards was $288 million, reflecting uncertainty in generating taxable income. Overall, the company faces challenges in maintaining production levels and complying with extensive regulations, which could impact future financial performance."

application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions , some of which are subjective and complex , that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements . we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position : revenue recognition : revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists , title and risk of loss have transferred , the selling price is fixed or determinable , and collectability is reasonably assured . generally , sales are recognized upon shipment or upon delivery to our customers ' site , based upon shipping terms or legal requirements . some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes . we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained . we also maintain an allowance for product returns , as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience . impairment of long-lived assets : long-lived assets , including property , plant and equipment , are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable . an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset . once an asset is considered impaired , an impairment loss is recorded within other expense ( income ) for the difference between the asset 's carrying value and its fair value . for assets held and used in the business , management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset , discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate . for assets held for sale or for investment purposes , management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset , less disposition costs . during 2016 , as part of our restructuring plan , we recorded within other expense a $ 4.5 million non-cash asset write-down associated with the discontinued use of certain equipment . impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets : goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually , following the completion of our annual budget and long-range planning process , or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable . goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level , which is the same as , or one level below , our operating segments . recent accounting guidance allows entities to first assess qualitative factors , including macroeconomic conditions , industry and market considerations , cost factors , and overall financial performance , to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test . we considered this guidance when performing our annual impairment testing , but elected to continue utilizing the two-step quantitative impairment test . the first step in the two-step test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount , including goodwill . if the carrying amount exceeds fair value , the second step must be performed . the second step requires the comparison of the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value , which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired as of the testing date . any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value would represent an impairment loss . considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value . amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test , such as future sales , future cash flows and long-term growth rates , are consistent with internal projections and operating plans . amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products , as well as our timeliness and success in new-product innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multi-component systems . changes in the estimate of fair value , including the estimate of

visitors arrived in the state in 2016 . this was an increase of 3.0 % from the previous high of 8.7 million visitor arrivals in 2015 . the hta also reported that total spending by visitors increased to $ 15.61 billion in 2016 , an increase of 4.2 % , from the previous high of $ 14.98 billion in 2015 . according to the hawaii department of business economic development & tourism ( `` dbedt `` ) , total visitor arrivals and visitor spending are expected to gain 1.8 % and 4.0 % in 2017 , respectively . hawaii 's labor market conditions also continued to improve in 2016 . the department of labor and industrial relations reported that hawaii 's seasonally adjusted annual unemployment rate improved to 2.9 % in december 2016 , compared to 3.3 % in december 2015. the last time the seasonally adjusted annual unemployment rate was at 2.9 % was in september 2007. in addition , hawaii 's unemployment rate in december 2016 of 2.9 % , which is among the lowest in the nation , remained below the national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.7 % . dbedt projects hawaii 's seasonally adjusted annual unemployment rate to be 3.4 % in 2017. real personal income and real gross state product grew by approximately 2.4 % and 2.0 % , respectively , in 2016 . dbedt projects real personal income and real gross state product to grow by 2.6 % and 1.9 % , respectively , in 2017. based on the recent developments in the national and global economy , the performance of hawaii 's tourism industry , the labor market conditions in the state , and growth of personal income and tax revenues , dbedt expects hawaii 's economy will continue to experience positive growth in 2017. real estate lending is a primary focus for us , including residential mortgage , commercial mortgage and construction loans . as a result , we are dependent on the strength of hawaii 's real estate market . home sales in hawaii were strong in 2016 . according to the honolulu board of realtors , oahu single-family home prices soared to record highs in 2016 . the median resale price in 2016 for single-family homes on oahu was $ 735,000 , representing an increase of 5.0 % from the median resale price of $ 700,000 in 2015 . the median resale price for condominiums on oahu was $ 390,000 in 2016 , representing an increase of 8.3 % from the median resale price of $ 360,000 in 2015 . oahu unit sales volume increased by 6.5 % for single-family homes and increased by 8.4 % for condominiums in 2016 from 2015 . we believe the hawaii real estate market will continue to remain strong in 2017 , however , there can be no assurance that this will occur . as we have seen in the past , our operating results are significantly impacted by : ( i ) the economy in hawaii , and to a significantly lesser extent , california , and ( ii ) the composition of our loan portfolio . loan demand , deposit growth , provision , asset quality , noninterest income and noninterest expense are all affected by changes in economic conditions . if the residential and commercial real estate markets we have exposure to deteriorate as they did in the latter part of 2007 through 2010 , our results of operations would be negatively impacted . see `` â€”overview of results of operationsâ€”concentrations of credit risk `` for a further discussion on how a deteriorating real estate market , combined with the elevated concentration risk within our portfolio , could have a significant negative impact on our asset quality and credit losses . critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ( `` gaap `` ) requires that management make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosures made . accounting estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and would materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of or for the periods presented . management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates noted below with the audit committee of the board of directors , and the audit committee has reviewed the accompanying disclosures . 34 allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance is management 's estimate of incurred credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date . we maintain our allowance at an amount we expect to be sufficient to absorb probable losses incurred in our loan and lease portfolio . at december 31 , 2016 , we had an allowance of $ 56.6 million , compared to $ 63.3 million at december 31 , 2015 . during the fourth quarter of 2016 , the company implemented an enhanced allowance methodology due to the growth in the portfolio and improved credit quality . management believes the enhanced methodology provides for greater precision in calculating the allowance . the following summarizes the key enhancements made to the allowance methodology : collapsed 128 segments into nine segments . story_separator_special_tag the income tax expense and effective tax rate in 2015 was negatively impacted by $ 0.6 million in additional state income tax expense resulting from the reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the redemption of federal home loan bank of des moines membership stock in june 2015. the income tax expense and effective tax rate in 2016 was positively impacted by $ 0.6 million in death benefit proceeds from bank-owned life insurance received in 2016 , compared to $ 0.2 million received in 2015 , which are tax-exempt . our net income on average assets and average shareholders ' equity for 2016 was 0.90 % and 9.16 % , respectively , compared to 0.92 % and 8.91 % , respectively , in 2015 . 2015 vs. 2014 comparison in 2015 , we recognized net income of $ 45.9 million , or $ 1.40 per diluted common share , compared to net income of $ 40.5 million , or $ 1.07 per diluted common share , in 2014. the increase in net income from 2014 was primarily due to a higher credit to the provision , as well as an increase in net interest income , and a decrease in other operating expense . we recorded a credit to the provision of $ 15.7 million in 2015 , compared to $ 6.4 million in 2014. total credit costs , which include the provision , write-downs of loans classified as held for sale , foreclosed asset expense , gains on sales of foreclosed assets , and the change in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments , amounted to a credit of $ 16.0 million in 2015 , compared to a credit of $ 6.0 million in 2014. net interest income increased by $ 6.1 million from 2014 to 2015 , primarily due to an increase in average loans and leases . other operating expense decreased by $ 1.6 million , primarily due to a credit to the reserve for residential mortgage loan repurchase losses of $ 1.4 million recorded in 2015 , compared to an increase to the reserve of $ 0.5 million recorded in 2014 , lower salaries and employee benefits of $ 1.5 million , branch consolidation and relocation costs of $ 1.3 million recorded in 2014 , and lower foreclosed asset expense of $ 1.2 million . these decreases in other operating expense were partially offset by higher computer software expense of $ 2.5 million and higher amortization of intangible assets of $ 1.5 million . these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in other operating income of $ 4.8 million from 2014 to 2015. the decrease in other operating income was due primarily to investment securities losses of $ 1.9 million recorded in 2015 , compared to investment securities gains of $ 0.2 million in 2014. in addition , we recorded lower income recovered on loans 38 previously charged off of $ 0.6 million and recorded net unrealized losses on loans held for sale and interest rate locks of $ 0.3 million in 2015 , compared to net unrealized gains on loans held for sale and interest rate locks of $ 0.3 million in 2014. in addition , income tax expense increased by $ 6.7 million from 2014 primarily due to higher pre-tax income in 2015. our net income on average assets and average shareholders ' equity for 2015 was 0.92 % and 8.91 % , respectively , compared to 0.85 % and 6.80 % , respectively , in 2014 . 39 net interest income the following table sets forth information concerning average interest-earning assets and

","Hawaii's economic conditions showed significant improvement in 2016, driven primarily by its robust tourism sector, which recorded 8.9 million visitors, a 3.0% increase from 2015, and total visitor spending of $15.61 billion, up 4.2%. The state's unemployment rate fell to 2.9% in December 2016, down from 3.3% in December 2015, remaining below the national average of 4.7%. Projections for 2017 suggest a 1.8% increase in visitor arrivals and a 4.0% rise in spending. Real personal income and gross state product grew by approximately 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively, in 2016, with expectations of 2.6% and 1.9% growth in 2017. The real estate market also thrived, with Oahu's median single-family home price rising to $735,000 (up 5.0%) and condominiums to $390,000 (up 8.3%). The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased to $56.6 million from $63.3 million in 2015, reflecting improved credit quality. Net interest income increased by 5.5% to $160.1 million in 2016, attributed to a rise in average loans and leases. Overall, Hawaii's economy is expected to continue its positive trajectory into 2017, although potential risks remain from fluctuations in the real estate market."
44,"as a result of our exploration , considering structural geology , petrographic , geochemical and geophysical evidence , we have realized that all of the gold is sourced within a system of magmatic hydrothermal alteration features such as small pegmatitic dikes and chloritized schist . we believe these features are common to and link all of the hard-rock ( lode ) prospects , the weathering of which generated the gold placer deposits , and furthermore are an outlying expression of an underlying gold bearing pluton . we are currently defining drilling targets for a hard-rock ( lode ) gold deposit in an area of interest approximately 1,800 feet wide and over five miles long , possibly underlain by a series of mineralized magmatic intrusions ( plutons ) . exploration therefore has taken on two directions ; one toward defining a low-grade , large tonnage body of mineralization running beneath the headwaters of little squaw creek where dense swarms of gold mineralized pegmatitic dikelets are seen , the other a deeper , larger mineralized plutonic body ( ies ) from which the district 's mineralizing fluids may have emanated and migrated through chandalar country rock . our main focus continues to be the exploration of these hard-rock targets . we were successful in raising funds for a limited exploration program in 2014 and reclamation work in 2015 ; however , weak financial markets prevented us from obtaining funds for significant exploration in other years from 2012 through 2020. significant increases in the price of gold since 2019 , appear to have increased the availability of funds so we are hopeful to secure sufficient funds for a major exploration program in the near future . because of the weak financial markets suffered by the mining industry in recent years , we endeavored to develop our placer properties as a source of internal cash to protect us from future market fluctuations and to provide funds for future exploration . in 2012 , goldrich and nyacau llc ( â€œ nyacau â€ ) formed goldrich nyacau placer llc ( â€œ gnp â€ ) , a 50/50 joint-venture company , managed by nyacau , to mine goldrich 's various placer properties at chandalar . 44 as shown below , the placer gold extracted by gnp increased each year from 2015 through 2018 , trending toward production figures that were anticipated by a preliminary economic assessment authored by qualified geologists for us : replace_table_token_0_th although gnp 's extraction increased over the years , ultimately the extraction numbers attained over those years fell short of the minimum production requirements required in the operating agreement . according to the terms of the agreement , gnp was required to pay a minimum production requirement of 1,100 ounces for 2016 , 1,200 ounces for 2017 , and 1,300 ounces for 2018 to both goldrich and nyacau by october 31 , 2018. this payment was not made . under the joint venture operating agreement , gnp would be dissolved if gnp failed to meet the minimum production requirement . on august 20 , 2018 , we announced the intended dissolution of the gnp joint venture . according to the terms of the joint venture operating agreement , gnp was required to pay a minimum production requirement of 1,100 ounces for 2016 , 1,200 ounces for 2017 , and 1,300 ounces for 2018 to both goldrich and nyacau by october 31 , 2018. this payment was not made . under the joint venture operating agreement , gnp would be dissolved if gnp failed to meet the minimum production requirement . gnp was formally dissolved in may 2019 and is currently being liquidated with nyacau managing the process . goldrich and nyacau are currently in arbitration as noted above . subsequent to 2019 , goldrich commissioned an independent third-party mining engineering firm to complete a mining plan and initial assessment for the company 's chandalar mine . story_separator_special_tag december 31 , 2020 we had total liabilities of $ 9,588,289 and total assets of $ 703,858. this compares to total liabilities of $ 8,084,670 and total assets of $ 724,992 on december 31 , 2019. as of december 31 , 2020 , our liabilities consist of $ 262,189 for remediation and asset retirement obligations , $ 503,590 of notes payable in gold , $ 3,641,053 of notes payable to related parties , $ 1,062,106 of notes payable , $ 1,838,362 of trade payables and accrued liabilities , $ 787,789 due to related parties , $ 959,504 of interest payable to related parties , $ 452,478 of interest payable , and $ 30,618 for dividends payable . of these liabilities , $ 9,309,333 are due within 12 months . the increase in liabilities compared to december 31 , 2019 is largely due to the secured senior notes payable that came due in october 2018 and as amended on november 1 , 2019 to be payable within 10 days of a demand notice of the holders . in addition , notes payable in gold increased as a result of an increase in gold prices during 2020 , which increased the valuation of gold ounces to be delivered under the contracts . the increase in total assets was due to a purchase of membership units in chandalar gold llc , and interest receivable related to the arbitration for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , see joint venture . story_separator_special_tag subsequent to december 31 , 2020 , on april 7 , 2021 , the arbitration panel issued two orders : Â· order on respondents ' motion to preserve confidentiality of arbitration proceedings , wherein the panel ruled that the company did not violate confidentiality when it filed the arbitration rulings as exhibits to its public reporting with the securities and exchange commission , and Â· order on respondents ' motion to confirm judgment , to correct , clarify , or modify an award made in the partial final award . this order confirmed a gnp claim against the company for reclamation costs was to be awarded to gnp instead of nyacau . the order also confirmed $ 50,685 for additional reclamation costs , including interest of $ 2,589 was due to gnp . this event has been recognized and accrued in the financial statements for the year ended december 31 , 2020 mining permit and future mining activities the upward movements in the price of gold to a range of $ 1,800 to $ 2,000 per ounce or higher during 2020 created renewed interest in gold mining , gold exploration and investments in companies engaging in those activities , including the junior mining/exploration sector in which we participate . additionally , the fact that we own a mine that has produced over 40,000 ounces in recent years along an annual increasing trend has caught the interest of placer mining companies and investors who support placer mining operations . we believe we have the fundamentals to raise capital and continue our primary strategy of exploration and secondarily placer mining . if we can attract the type of investor who is comfortable with reinstating the placer mining operation , we may have a viable and productive path forward toward obtaining financing in the short-term to achieve long-term profitability . to effectively pursue this strategy , ( 1 ) the mining permit for the chandalar mine must be transferred to us from nyacau , our former jv partner and the current holder of the permit , ( 2 ) financial concessions and removal of doubt concerning loc1 must be done , and ( 3 ) reclamation costs for the chandalar mine that currently are the responsibility of nyacau 48 must be mitigated by a mining plan that accomplishes much of the reclamation costs as part of the ongoing mining activity . we do not believe an investor or group of investors will be willing to step forward to fund the placer mining activity without these three factors aligning themselves as described . additionally , without a profitable mining operation , the ability to pay back the notes may not be available to us . if that is the case , the payback would require us to raise money from placements of equity instruments to raise the cash to satisfy the obligations . such a use of funds may present a funding effort that receives tepid or little response in the equity markets . however , we do believe there are investors motivated to provide funding for exploration programs to locate and exploit the hard rock deposits from which the placer mineralization is coming from . this strategy can be pursued independent of any mining activities . off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements . inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition . contractual obligations see subsequent events above . critical accounting policies we have identified our critical accounting policies , the application of which may materially affect the financial statements , either because of the significance of the financials statement item to which they relate , or because they require management 's judgment in making estimates and assumptions in measuring , at a specific point in time , events which will be settled in the future . the critical accounting policies , judgments and estimates which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below : Â· estimates of the recoverability of the carrying value of our mining and mineral property assets . we use publicly available pricing or valuation estimates of comparable property and equipment to assess the carrying value of our mining and mineral property assets . however , if future results vary materially from the assumptions and estimates used by us , we may be required to recognize an impairment in the assets ' carrying value . Â· estimates of our environmental liabilities . our potential obligations in environmental remediation , asset retirement obligations or reclamation activities are considered critical due to the assumptions and estimates inherent in accruals of such liabilities , including uncertainties relating to specific reclamation and remediation methods and costs , the application and changing of environmental laws , regulations and interpretations by regulatory authorities . Â· accounting for investments in joint ventures . for joint ventures in which we do not have joint control or significant influence , the cost method is used . under the cost method , these investments are carried at the lower of cost or fair value . for those joint ventures in which there is joint control between the parties and in which we have significant influence , the equity method is utilized whereby our share of the ventures ' earnings and losses is included in the statement of operations as earnings in joint ventures and our investments therein are adjusted by a similar amount . we have no significant influence over our joint venture described in note 5 joint ventures to the financial statements , and therefore account for our investment using the cost method . for joint ventures where we hold more than 50 % of the voting interest and has significant influence , the joint venture is consolidated with the presentation of a non-controlling interest . in determining whether significant 49 influence exists , we consider our participation in policy-making decisions and our representation on
","Exploration efforts have revealed that gold in the area is sourced from magmatic hydrothermal alteration features, including pegmatitic dikes and chloritized schist, which connect hard-rock (lode) prospects to gold placer deposits. The targeted exploration area spans approximately 1,800 feet wide and over five miles long, potentially underlain by mineralized plutons. The focus is on defining a low-grade, large tonnage body beneath Little Squaw Creek and a deeper plutonic body. Financial challenges from 2012 to 2020 limited exploration funding, but rising gold prices since 2019 have improved funding prospects. A joint venture, Goldrich Nyacau Placer LLC (GNP), was formed in 2012 to mine placer properties, but failed to meet minimum production requirements of 1,100 ounces in 2016, 1,200 ounces in 2017, and 1,300 ounces in 2018, leading to its dissolution in May 2019. As of December 31, 2020, total liabilities were $9,588,289, with assets at $703,858, reflecting an increase in liabilities due to secured notes and rising gold prices. The company aims to secure a mining permit from Nyacau and mitigate reclamation costs to attract investors for future exploration and mining activities. The price of gold has risen to between $1,800 and $2,000 per ounce, renewing interest in gold mining and exploration. The company believes it can raise capital for exploration and potentially profitable mining operations, contingent on resolving key issues with the mining permit and reclamation responsibilities."
45,"because visian products are used in elective surgery , the rate of sales growth depends on continued improvement in global economic conditions . we discuss recent trends in visian sales in greater detail below under the heading visian icl and ticl sales . 29 continuously expand gross profit margin each quarter to achieve a level of 66.5 % for the full year . staar 's gross profit margin was 69.8 % in the fourth quarter and 67.5 % for the year . the biggest factor in the improving margins has been the change in our product mix . visian products yield a significantly higher profit margin than iols . and among iols , staar has increased average selling prices by emphasizing sales of its higher value iols , such as nanoflex and our toric iol . preloaded iol sales in some territories , especially japan , have historically yielded good profit margins and their sales increased 5 % during 2011. since 2009 staar has de-emphasized lower margin sales of non-iol , non-icl products . based on performance in the first half of 2011 , staar raised its gross profit margin target to 66.5 % for the full year from an initial target of 66 % at year end . staar believes it can continue to improve its profit margins through further emphasis on high value products , through cost reductions from its manufacturing consolidation plan , and potentially through economies of scale if unit volumes of higher value products increase . achieve profitability in all four quarters of 2011. staar achieved net earnings of $ 1.3 million in 2011 , or $ 0.04 per share . in the fourth quarter staar achieved net earnings of $ 0.1 million , or $ 0.00 per share . staar 's achievement of net earnings of $ 0.3 million in the first quarter of 2011 marked the first quarter since 1999 during which the company reported net income from continuing operations . based on first and second quarter results , staar increased this metric from an original target of profitability in three of four quarters , and targeted profits during each quarter of the year . we caution that staar has just crossed the threshold of profitability , and sustained profitability remains vulnerable to the competitive nature of our industry and to the risk factors described in our annual report on form 10-k. other highlights global visian icl and ticl sales staar continues to focus its visian marketing and sales efforts in the top ten refractive markets , based on the success of this strategy from 2009 through 2011. these markets include the u.s. , japan , korea , china , india , spain , middle east , germany , u.k. , and latin america . since 2009 , staar has experienced a breakthrough in market penetration in korea , where it believes implants of visian products have reached approximately 13.4 % of the total volume of refractive surgery procedures . revenues from sales of visian icl products in korea increased 54 % in the fourth quarter and 34 % for the year . because of the rapid growth of visian icl sales and market share in korea , staar is using korea as a model of best practices for marketing that may serve to significantly increase market share in other key territories . other territories where visian products experienced significant growth in 2011 over prior year were china , japan , germany , the middle east and india . in september 2011 , staar launched the v4c model of the visian icl with centraflow technology in countries that recognize the ce mark . the centraflow technology uses a proprietary port in the center of the icl optic of a size determined to optimize the flow of fluid within the eye , and eliminates the need for the surgeon to perform a yag peripheral iridotomy procedure days before the icl implant or a surgical iridotomy at time of implant . by simplifying the procedure and increasing patient comfort , the v4c makes the superior visual outcomes of the visian icl available through a surgical implantation experience closer to lasik , which should attract new surgeons and patients to the product . uptake of the new product exceeded staar 's expectations in the fourth quarter of 2011 , as approximately 25 % of the visian icl and ticl sales volume in europe transitioned to v4c . staar expects its customers ' enthusiasm for the simplified v4c procedure to drive increased visian icl sales in 2012 . the launch of v4c follows the september 2010 introduction of the v4b model , which offers an expanded range of correction , in territories that recognize the ce mark . the expanded range includes icls with lower levels of myopia correction in quarter-diopter increments , toric hyperopic icls to treat astigmatism and far-sightedness , and toric icls in the low to zero range of myopia to treat patients primarily affected by astigmatism . these product line extensions more than double the number of patients who could benefit from visian products in europe and other territories that accept the ce mark . in 2011 , approximately 7 % of the v4b sales in the markets where it has been available were in the new expanded treatment range . staar believes that , where available , the v4c and v4b models have significantly improved the competitiveness of the visian product line and have moved staar closer to its goal of positioning the icl and ticl throughout the world as primary choices for refractive surgery . visian products now address all degrees of refractive error that can be treated with laser eye surgery , as well as moderate and severe errors beyond the effective range of laser eye surgery . in some key markets of the asia pacific region staar has not yet introduced the v4b . story_separator_special_tag replace_table_token_4_th * denotes change is greater than 100 % the following table presents our net sales , by

the increase in net sales was due to 15 % increase in our core product sales ( iol and icl ) . core products represented 95.0 % and 94.3 % of the company 's total sales in fiscal year 2011 and 2010 , respectively . changes in foreign currency favorably impacted our net sales in 2011 by $ 1.7 million . 34 net sales for 2010 were $ 55.0 million , a 7.6 % increase over the $ 51.1 million reported in

2009 , respectively . changes in foreign currency favorably impacted our net sales in 2010 by $ 1.2 million . total iol sales were $ 27.5 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010 , respectively . increased sales of preloaded acrylic iols in china and germany and toric iols in the u.s. were offset by decreased collamer and silicone iol sales . although iol sales were essentially flat year over year , iol margins were up 3 % due to improved average selling prices , costs , and geographic mix . as an example , sales of our largest selling iol , the preloaded silicone iol , were down 1 % year over year . however , preloaded iol gross profit was up 3 % due to higher sales in japan where margins are high and lower sales in europe where margins are low . iol sales represented 43.9 % and 50.1 % of the company 's total sales in fiscal 2011 and 2010 , respectively . preloaded iol sales represented 72 % of total iol sales in fiscal 2011 , compared with 69 % in fiscal 2010. total iol sales for 2010 were $ 27.6 million , a 4.8 % increase over the $ 26.3 million reported in fiscal 2009. the increase in iol sales was due to a 28.2 % increase in preloaded acrylic iol sales primarily as a result of the full rollout of the product in europe and also due to a 19.6 % increase in nanoflex iol sales in the u.s. these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of lower margin silicone iols . iol sales represented 50.1 % and 51.5 % of the company 's total sales in fiscal 2010 and 2009 , respectively . preloaded iol sales represented 69.3 % of total iol sales in fiscal 2010 , compared with 66 % in fiscal 2009. total icl sales for 2011 were $ 32.1 million , a 32 % increase over the $ 24.3 million reported in fiscal 2010. the increase in icl sales resulted from a 35 % increase in sales in our top ten refractive markets which comprised 85 % of our total icl sales in 2011. icl sales represented 51 % and 44 % our total sales for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 , respectively . toric icl sales

Key markets for Visian products included Korea, where sales increased by 54% in Q4 and 34% for the year, capturing approximately 13.4% of the refractive surgery market. The launch of the V4C model in September 2011 contributed to a 25% transition in sales volume in Europe. Overall, Staar's strategic focus on high-value products and market expansion in top refractive markets like the U.S., Japan, and China is expected to drive continued growth."
46,"owning these cost-advantaged assets , the output from which is fully contracted through 2025 , in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable and growing cash flows . our plants are sited in robust fiber baskets providing stable pricing for the low-grade fiber used to produce wood pellets . our raw materials are byproducts of traditional timber harvesting , principally low-value wood materials , such as trees generally not suited for sawmilling or other manufactured forest products , and tree tops and limbs , understory , brush and slash that are generated in a harvest . our strategy is to fully contract the wood pellet production from our plants under long-term , take-or-pay off-take contracts with a diversified and creditworthy customer base . our long-term off-take contracts typically provide for fixed-price deliveries that may include provisions that escalate the price over time and provide for other margin protection . during 2020 , production capacity from our wood pellet production plants and wood pellets sourced from our affiliates and third parties were approximately equal to the contracted volumes under our existing long-term , take-or-pay off-take contracts . our long-term , take-or-pay off-take contracts provide for a product sales backlog of $ 14.6 billion and have a total weighted-average remaining term of 12.8 years from february 1 , 2021. under our current product sales backlog , our plants are fully contracted through 2025. assuming all volumes under the firm and contingent long-term off-take contracts held by our sponsor were included with our product sales backlog for firm and contingent contracted product sales , our product sales backlog would increase to $ 19.9 billion and the total weighted-average remaining term from february 1 , 2021 would increase to 14.0 years . our customers use our wood pellets as a substitute fuel for coal in dedicated biomass or co-fired coal power plants . wood pellets serve as a suitable â€œ drop-in â€ alternative to coal because of their comparable heat content , density and form . due to the 39 uninterruptible nature of our customers ' fuel consumption , our customers require a reliable supply of wood pellets that meet stringent product specifications . we have built our operations and assets to deliver and certify the highest levels of product quality and our proven track record of reliable deliveries enables us to charge premium prices for this certainty . in addition to our customers ' focus on the reliability of supply , they are concerned about the combustion efficiency of the wood pellets and their safe handling . because combustion efficiency is a function of energy density , particle size distribution , ash/inert content and moisture , our customers require that we supply wood pellets meeting minimum criteria for a variety of specifications and , in some cases , provide incentives for exceeding our contract specifications . recent developments georgia biomass acquisition on july 31 , 2020 , we acquired all of the limited liability company interests in georgia biomass holding llc , a georgia limited liability company ( â€œ georgia biomass â€ ) and the indirect owner of a wood pellet production plant located in waycross , georgia ( the â€œ waycross plant â€ ) , for total consideration of $ 164.0 million in cash , after accounting for certain adjustments ( the â€œ georgia biomass acquisition â€ ) . the waycross plant has been in operation since 2011 and has a production capacity of 800,000 mtpy . the waycross plant terminals its production at a two-dome pellet export terminal with a storage capacity of 50,000 mt at the port of savannah , georgia pursuant to a lease and associated terminal services agreement effective through 2028. approximately 500,000 mtpy of the waycross plant 's production is contracted under separate agreements to one of our existing customers through 2024. in august 2020 , georgia biomass converted to a limited liability company organized under the laws of the state of delaware under the name enviva pellets waycross holdings sub , llc ( â€œ

such transaction , the â€œ greenwood drop-down â€ ) . the greenwood drop-down was an asset acquisition between entities under common control and accounted for on the carryover basis of accounting . accordingly , the consolidated financial statements for the period beginning july 1 , 2020 reflect the acquisition . on the date of and in connection with the greenwood drop-down , our sponsor assigned five biomass off-take contracts to us ( collectively , the â€œ associated off-take contracts â€ ) . the associated off-take contracts call for aggregate annual deliveries of 1.4 million mtpy and mature between 2031 and 2041. our sponsor also assigned to us fixed-rate shipping contracts with aggregate annual shipping volume of 1.4 million mtpy . the associated off-take contracts were assigned to fully contract wood pellets produced by the greenwood plant and waycross plant . the shipping contracts were assigned to facilitate transportation of those produced wood pellets . the greenwood plant current production capacity is 500,000 mtpy of wood pellets and transports its production via rail service to our terminal assets at the port of wilmington , north carolina . we expect

quarter of 2020 , down 48.5 % in the third quarter of 2020 and down 50.6 % in the fourth quarter of 2020. we expect the current trend of depressed revpar levels to continue until there is widespread deployment of effective covid-19 vaccines . the full impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the lodging industry continues to evolve and will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak , the existence of governmental stay-at-home orders , deployment of vaccines , peoples ' willingness to travel , and the strength and timing of an economic recovery . all of these factors are uncertain , and the full impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the lodging industry can not be predicted at this time . comparison of the year ended december 31 , 2020 ( â€œ 2020 â€ )

under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a non-exclusive , non-transferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution . non-bundled license revenue increased due mainly to an increase in standalone license sales in our credit union segment . such license fees will fluctuate as non-bundled license sales are sporadic in

standard by one year . the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its annual reporting period beginning july 1 , 2018 , including interim periods within that reporting period . along with the deferral of the effective date , asu no . 2015-14 allows early application as of the original effective date . entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption . the company is currently evaluating the newly issued guidance , including which transition

financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ( â€œ u.s . gaap â€ ) . the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements . the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenue and expenses , as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances . changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements . we have identified several critical accounting estimates . an accounting estimate is considered critical if both : ( a ) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved , and ( b ) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements . revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission . the application of these pronouncements requires judgment , including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements , whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements , and whether vendor-specific objective evidence ( â€œ vsoe â€ ) of fair value exists for those elements . customers receive certain elements of our products and services over time . changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and deferred revenue reflected in the financial statements . license arrangements : for software license agreements , the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of the product or service has occurred , the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable . for arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable , revenue is deferred until 30 payments become due . the company 's software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or â€œ elements . â€ generally , none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements . for multiple element arrangements , which contain software elements and non-software elements , we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the non-software deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement . for our non-software deliverables , we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price ( `` esp `` ) . for our software elements , we use vsoe for this allocation when it can be established and esp when vsoe can not be established . the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy : vsoe if available , third party evidence ( `` tpe `` ) if vsoe is not available , or esp if neither vsoe or tpe are available . generally , we are not able to determine tpe because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality can not be obtained . esp is determined after considering both market conditions ( such as the sale of similar products in the market place ) and entity-specific factors ( such as pricing practices and the specifics of each transaction ) . for our non-software deliverables , a delivered item is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has standalone value and if the customer has a general right of return relative to the delivered item , delivery or performance of the undelivered item is
","In fiscal 2015, the company reported a revenue increase of 7% or $83,017, driven by growth in support and service revenues, particularly in electronic payment and outsourcing services. Cost of sales rose by 6%, aligning with revenue growth, leading to a 9% increase in gross profit. Operating expenses also increased by 6%, while the provision for income taxes rose by 4%. Consequently, net income saw a significant 13% increase. The company anticipates continued growth in fiscal 2016, supported by a strong sales pipeline and recurring revenue streams. Notably, non-bundled license revenue grew due to standalone sales in the credit union segment, while support and service revenues expanded across all components, particularly in electronic payment services. Outsourcing services, under multi-year contracts, are expected to provide a stable revenue stream. Implementation services revenue increased due to heightened demand for core banking and payment solutions. However, hardware revenue decreased due to a shift towards outsourcing contracts and declining computer prices. The company is also preparing for upcoming accounting standards changes, including ASU No. 2014-09 on revenue recognition, effective July 1, 2018, and ASU No. 2015-03 on debt issuance costs, effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. Overall, the companyâ€™s financial health is bolstered by a strong balance sheet and a commitment to customer service, positioning it well for future opportunities."
49,"although the company has seen demand for its oil and gas related products and services in the united states and canada impacted by these industry conditions , we continue to aggressively market our drilling products . the oil and gas industry is increasingly using directional ( e.g . , horizontal ) drilling in their exploration and production activities because of significantly improved recovery rates that can be achieved with these methods . with the rise of this type of drilling , traditional drill string tools used for vertical drilling do not necessarily provide the best performance or are not well suited for directional drilling . in addition , current and expected oil and natural gas prices combined with more technically challenging horizontal drilling has driven the demand for new technologies . we believe the value of our drill-n-ream tool has proven to provide significant operational efficiencies and costs savings for horizontal drilling activity and , combined with our low market penetration , provide us sales opportunities in soft as well as robust markets . how we generate our revenue we are a drilling and completion tool technology company . we generate revenue from the refurbishment , manufacturing , repair , rental and sale of drill string tools . our manufactured products are produced in a standard manufacturing operation , even when produced to our customer 's specifications . we also earn royalty fees under certain arrangements for certain tools we sell . tool sales , rentals and other related revenue tool and product sales : revenue for tool and product sales is recognized upon shipment of tools or products to the customer . shipping and handling costs related to tool and product sales are recorded gross as a component of both the sales price and cost of the product sold . tool rental : rental revenue is recognized upon completion of the customer 's job for which the tool was rented . while the duration of the rents vary by job and number of runs , these rents are generally less than one month . the rental agreements are typically based on the price per run or footage drilled and do not have any minimum rental payments or term . 26 other related revenue : we receive revenue from the repair of tools upon delivery of the repaired tool to the customer . we earn royalty commission revenue when our customer invoices their customer for the use of our tools . contract services drill bit manufacturing and refurbishment : we recognize revenue for our pdc drill bit services upon transfer of control , which we have determined to be upon shipment of the product . shipping and handling costs related to refurbishing services are paid directly by the customer at the time of shipment . we also provide contracting manufacturing services to customers . costs of conducting our business the principal elements of cost of sales for manufacturing , repair , rental and sale of tools ( â€œ product â€ ) are the direct and indirect costs to manufacture , repair and supply the product , including labor , materials , utilities , equipment repair , lease expense related to our facilities , supplies and freight . selling , general and administrative expense is comprised of costs such as new business development , technical product support , research and development costs , compensation expense for general corporate operations including accounting , human resources , risk management , etc . , information technology expenses , safety and environmental expenses , legal and professional fees and other related administrative functions . other income ( expense ) , net is comprised primarily of interest expense associated with outstanding borrowings net of interest income , gains ( losses ) of disposed assets and recovery of related party note receivable . 27 results of operations the following table represents our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_1_th material changes of certain items in our statements of operations included in our financial statements for the comparative periods are discussed below . 28 revenue . our revenue decreased approximately $ 8,526,000 , or 45 % , to $ 10,471,000. the decrease was a result of the covid-19 pandemic induced decline in the demand for oil and gas which resulted in a significant reduction in drilling activity globally . despite the decline in drilling activity , international revenue increased $ 565,000 or 43 % to $ 1,880,000. tool revenue was $ 7,051,000 , down 42 % or $ 5,066,000 , from the prior-year period . contract services revenue decreased approximately $ 3,461,000 , or 50 % , to $ 3,420,000. operating costs and expenses . significant cost management efforts led to total operating costs and expenses declining approximately $ 5,605,000 , or 28 % , during 2020 compared with 2019 . â— cost of revenue decreased approximately $ 3,077,000 and was driven by a decrease in sales and the impact of cost savings resulting from the company 's reduction in force and the closing of our abilene dnr tool repair center . as a percentage of revenue , cost of revenue was 49 % for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , and 43 % for the year ended december 31 , 2019 . â— selling , general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $ 1,916,000 during 2020 compared with 2019. the decrease was primarily due to cost reduction measures implemented by us in 2020 in an effort to offset the reduction in revenue . these measures included headcount reductions , salary reductions and the deferral of new product development initiatives . story_separator_special_tag approximately 82 % of our revenue is from the united states and approximately 18 % is from the middle east for the year ended december 31 , 2020. for the year ended december 31 , 2019 , approximately 93 % of our revenue was from the united states and approximately 7 % was from the middle east . revenue recognition we are a drilling and completion tool technology company and we generate revenue from the manufacturing , repair , rental and sale of drilling and completion tools . our manufactured products are produced in a standard manufacturing operation , even when produced to our customer 's specifications . we earn royalty commission revenue when our customer invoices their customer for the use of the tools . stock-based compensation stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date , based on the fair value of the award , and is recognized ratably as an expense over the vesting period of the award . determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require the use of subjective assumptions , including the expected life of the stock-based payment awards and stock price volatility . management uses the black-scholes option pricing model to value award grants and determine the related compensation expense . the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent management 's best estimates , but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment . as a result , if factors change and management uses different assumptions , the company 's stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future . the company expects to continue to grant stock-based awards in the future , and to the extent that the company does , its actual stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase . concentration of credit risk substantially all of our revenue is derived from our refurbishing of pdc drill bits for baker hughes and from dti when we 1 ) sell the drill-n-ream tool , 2 ) repair the dnr tool , and 3 ) earn royalty on our customer 's rental of the dnr tool to the end user . 32 accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are generally due within 60 days of the invoice date . no interest is charged on past-due balances . we grant credit to our customers based upon an evaluation of each customer 's financial condition . we periodically monitor the payment history and ongoing creditworthiness of our customers . an allowance for doubtful accounts is established at a level estimated by management to be adequate based upon various factors including historical experience , aging status of customer accounts , payment history and financial condition of our customers . the allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 0 and $ 9,288 at december 31 , 2020 and 2019 , respectively . intangible assets annually , and more often as necessary , we will perform an evaluation of our intangible assets for indications of impairment . if indications exist , we will perform an evaluation of the fair value of the intangible assets and , if necessary , record an impairment charge . as of december 31 , 2020 , the company performed an evaluation of the intangible assets . based on this assessment , we have determined no impairment was needed . valuation of inventories inventories consist of raw materials , work-in-process and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost , determined using the weighted-average cost method , or net realizable value . finished goods inventories include raw materials , direct labor and production overhead . the company regularly reviews inventories on hand and current market conditions to determine if the cost of finished goods inventories exceed current market prices and impairs the cost basis of the inventory accordingly . the company wrote off $ 4,800 and $ 79,200 related to slow moving inventory in 2020 and 2019 , respectively . property , plant and equipment property , plant and equipment is stated at cost . the cost of ordinary maintenance and repair is charged to operating expense , while replacement of critical components and major improvements are capitalized . depreciation or amortization of property , plant and equipment , is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset 's estimated useful life as follows : buildings and leasehold improvements 2-39 years machinery , equipment and rental tools 18 months -10 years office equipment , fixtures and software 3-7 years transportation equipment 5 - 30 years property , plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable . indicative events or circumstances include , but are not limited to , matters such as a significant decline in market value or a significant change in business climate . an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition . the amount of impairment loss recognized is the excess of the asset 's carrying value over its fair value . assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less cost to sell . there were no impairment losses related to fixed assets during 2020 and 2019. upon sale or other disposition of an asset , the company recognizes a gain or loss on disposal measured as the difference between the net carrying value of the asset and the net proceeds received . related party note receivable in january 2014 , we entered into a note purchase and sale agreement under which we agreed to purchase a loan made to tronco energy corporation ( â€œ tronco â€ ) , a party related to us through common control , in order to take over
","The company, a drilling and completion tool technology firm, has faced a significant decline in revenue, dropping approximately $8.5 million (45%) to $10.5 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on oil and gas demand, which led to reduced global drilling activity. Despite this, international revenue rose by $565,000 (43%) to $1.88 million. Tool revenue fell by $5.07 million (42%) to $7.05 million, while contract services revenue decreased by $3.46 million (50%) to $3.42 million. Operating costs and expenses were reduced by $5.6 million (28%) due to cost management efforts, with cost of revenue at 49% of total revenue for 2020, up from 43% in 2019. Approximately 82% of revenue came from the U.S. and 18% from the Middle East in 2020, compared to 93% and 7% respectively in 2019. The company generates revenue through the manufacturing, repair, rental, and sale of drilling tools, with tool sales recognized upon shipment. The allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from $9,288 in 2019 to $0 in 2020, reflecting improved credit management. The company also reported no impairment losses on intangible assets or fixed assets during 2020 and 2019."

forward-looking statements . critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the corporation 's financial condition and results of operations is based upon the corporation 's consolidated financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america . the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , revenues and expenses , and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management , which has a material impact on the carrying value of net loans . management considers the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period , requiring management to make assumptions about probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date . the impact of a sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance , which would negatively affect earnings . the allowance is based on two principles of accounting : ( i ) asc 450 , â€œ contingencies , â€ which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and can be estimated ; and ( ii ) asc 310 , â€œ receivables . â€ the allowance has two components : collectively evaluated allowances and individually evaluated allowances on substandard non-performing loans . each of these components is based upon estimates that can change over time . the allowance is based on historical experience and as a result can differ from actual losses incurred in the future . additionally , differences may result from qualitative factors such as unemployment data , gross domestic product , interest rates , retail sales , the value of real estate and real estate market conditions . the historical data is reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made as needed . various techniques are used to arrive at an individually evaluated allowance , including discounted cash flows and the fair market value of collateral . the use of these techniques is inherently subjective and the actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates . management considers , based on currently available information , the allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in loans held for investment . the use of these techniques is inherently subjective and the actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates , which , can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of operations . the corporation assesses loans individually and classifies loans when the accrual of interest has been discontinued , loans have been restructured or management has serious doubts about the future collectibility of principal and interest , even though the loans may currently be performing . factors considered in determining classification include , but are not limited to , expected future cash flows , the financial condition of the borrower and current economic conditions . story_separator_special_tag $ 49.5 million of loans originated for investment and $ 8.2 million of loans purchased for investment . the decrease in loans held for investment was consistent with the corporation 's strategy of managing credit and liquidity risk . the following tables describe the geographic distribution of real estate secured loans held for investment at june 30 , 2012 and 2011 , as a percentage of the total dollar amount outstanding ( dollars in thousands ) : as of june 30 , 2012 replace_table_token_34_th ( 1 ) other than the inland empire . as of june 30 , 2011 replace_table_token_35_th ( 1 ) other than the inland empire . during fiscal 2012 , the bank originated $ 2.57 billion in new loans , primarily through pbm , and purchased $ 8.2 million of loans for investment , primarily multi-family loans , from other financial institutions . a total of $ 2.47 billion of loans were sold during fiscal 2012. pbm loan production was sold primarily on a servicing released basis . the total loan origination volume was higher than last year , due primarily to relatively low mortgage interest rates , a less competitive mortgage banking environment and more stable , though still weakened , real estate market . the outstanding balance of loans held for sale increased $ 39.9 million , or 21 % , to $ 231.6 million at june 30 , 2012 from $ 191.7 million at june 30 , 2011. the increase was due primarily to higher loan origination volume and the timing difference between loan originations and loan sale settlements . the increase in loan originations was primarily attributable to relatively low mortgage interest rates and less competition . actions by the department of treasury and federal reserve in response to the credit crisis resulted in the ancillary benefit of lower mortgage interest rates , and the slow pace of the economic recovery has led the federal reserve to refrain from taking action to cause interest rates to increase . total real estate owned was $ 5.5 million at june 30 , 2012 , down $ 2.8 million , or 34 % , from $ 8.3 million at june 30 , 2011. as of june 30 , 2012 , real estate owned was comprised of 24 properties , primarily single-family residences located in southern california . this compares to 54 real estate owned properties at june 30 , 2011 , primarily single-family residences and single-family undeveloped lots located in southern california . the decrease in real estate owned was due primarily to better execution on the sale and disposition of real estate owned properties , which was partly offset by new foreclosures of delinquent loans . during fiscal 2012 , the bank acquired 68 real estate owned properties in the settlement of loans and sold 98 properties . fhlb â€“ san francisco stock decreased $ 4.7 million , or 17 % , to $ 22.3 million at june 30 , 2012 from $ 27.0 million at june 30 , 2011 , due to partial stock redemptions in fiscal 2012. the fhlb â€“ san francisco has a stated desire to strengthen its capital ratios and has been doing so by redeeming fewer shares from those members , including the 73 bank , with excess stock holdings . as of june 30 , 2012 , the required fhlb â€“ san francisco stock holding was $ 9.4 million resulting in an excess stock holding of $ 12.9 million . total deposits increased $ 15.6 million , or 2 % , to $ 961.4 million at june 30 , 2012 from $ 945.8 million at june 30 , 2011. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transaction accounts , which was partly offset by a decrease in time deposits . transaction accounts increased $ 43.3 million , or 9 % , to $ 515.6 million at june 30 , 2012 from $ 472.3 million at june 30 , 2011 ; while time deposits decreased $ 27.7 million , or 6 % , to $ 445.8 million at june 30 , 2012 from $ 473.5 million at june 30 , 2011. the total time deposits include brokered deposits of $ 7.1 million at june 30 , 2012 , down from $ 12.2 million at june 30 , 2011 due to the maturity of $ 5.1 million in fiscal 2012. the increase in transaction accounts was primarily attributable to the bank 's marketing strategy to promote transaction accounts and the strategic decision to compete less aggressively on time deposit interest rates . borrowings , consisting of fhlb â€“ san francisco advances , decreased $ 80.1 million , or 39 % , to $ 126.5 million at june 30 , 2012 from $ 206.6 million at june 30 , 2011. fhlb â€“ san francisco advances were primarily used to supplement the funding needs of the bank . the decrease was due to scheduled maturities of $ 90.0 million , partly offset by new long-term advances of $ 10.0 million , consistent with the corporation 's fiscal 2012 strategy of managing liquidity risk . the weighted-average maturity of the bank 's fhlb â€“ san francisco advances was approximately 39 months at june 30 , 2012 , as compared to the weighted-average maturity of 29 months at june 30 , 2011. total stockholders ' equity increased $ 3.9 million , or 3 % , to $ 144.8 million at june 30 , 2012 , from $ 140.9 million at june 30 , 2011 , primarily as a result of net income , partly offset by common stock repurchases and the quarterly cash dividends paid during fiscal 2012. the corporation repurchased 683,127 shares of its common stock , or approximately 6 % of the outstanding stock , for $ 6.7 million and paid $ 1.6 million of cash dividends to the corporation 's shareholders during fiscal 2012. comparison of operating results for the years ended june 30 , 2012 and 2011 general .
","As of June 30, 2012, the corporation reported a total of $961.4 million in deposits, reflecting a $15.6 million (2%) increase from $945.8 million in 2011, driven by a $43.3 million (9%) rise in transaction accounts to $515.6 million, while time deposits fell by $27.7 million (6%) to $445.8 million. The bank originated $2.57 billion in new loans and purchased $8.2 million in loans for investment during fiscal 2012, with total loan origination volume surpassing the previous year due to low mortgage interest rates and a less competitive environment. The outstanding balance of loans held for sale rose by $39.9 million (21%) to $231.6 million. Total real estate owned decreased by $2.8 million (34%) to $5.5 million, with 24 properties held, down from 54 in 2011. The corporation's stockholders' equity increased by $3.9 million (3%) to $144.8 million, attributed to net income, despite $6.7 million spent on repurchasing 683,127 shares (6% of outstanding stock) and $1.6 million in cash dividends. The allowance for loan losses, a critical accounting estimate, is subject to significant judgment and can materially affect financial results. The corporation's ability to manage risks, control costs, and adapt to regulatory changes remains crucial for future performance."

, repurchase shares of our common stock , expand our product lines and grow revenues through potential acquisitions . the automotive aftermarket the automotive aftermarket industry is comprised of a large number of diverse manufacturers varying in product specialization and size . in addition to manufacturing , aftermarket companies allocate resources towards an efficient distribution process and product engineering in order to maintain the flexibility and responsiveness on which their customers depend . aftermarket manufacturers must be efficient producers of small lot sizes and do not have to provide systems engineering support . aftermarket manufacturers also must distribute , with rapid turnaround times , products for a full range of domestic and import vehicles on the road . the primary customers of the automotive aftermarket manufacturers are national and regional warehouse distributors , large retail chains , automotive repair chains and the dealer service networks of original equipment manufacturers ( â€œ oems â€ ) . 27 index the automotive aftermarket industry differs substantially from the oem supply business . unlike the oem supply business that primarily follows trends in new car production , the automotive aftermarket industry 's performance primarily tends to follow different trends , such as : Â· growth in number of vehicles on the road ; Â·

applications have supplied a majority of the business to new car dealer networks . however , certain parts manufacturers have become more independent and are no longer affiliated with oems , which has provided , and may continue to provide , opportunities for us to supply replacement parts to the dealer service networks of the oems , both for warranty and outâ€‘ofâ€‘warranty repairs . seasonality . historically , our operating results have fluctuated by quarter , with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment . it is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest , specifically in the temperature control segment of our business . in addition to this seasonality , the demand for our temperature control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories . for example , a cool summer , as we experienced in both 2014 and 2013 , may lessen the demand for our temperature control products , while a warm summer , as we experienced in 2016 , may increase such demand . as a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our temperature control products , our working capital requirements typically peak near the end of the second quarter , as the inventory buildâ€‘up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received . during this period , our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility . inventory management . we face inventory management issues as a result of warranty and overstock returns . many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a 90-day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty , which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications and or the result of installation error . story_separator_special_tag interest expense was essentially flat year-over-year . interest expense was $ 1.5 million in 2015 compared to $ 1.6 million in 2014. the

52,"our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development , as well as the engineering costs incurred to design human interface solutions for oem customers prior to and after their commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products . these expenses have generally increased , reflecting our continuing commitment to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets . 38 selling , general , and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales , marketing , and administrative personnel ; internal sales and outside sales representatives ' commissions ; market and usability research ; outside legal , accounting , and consulting costs ; and other marketing and sales activities . these expenses have generally increased , primarily reflecting incremental staffing and related support costs associated with our increased business levels , growth in our existing markets , and penetration into new markets . critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenue , expenses , and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . on an ongoing basis , we evaluate our estimates , including those related to revenue recognition , allowance for doubtful accounts , cost of revenue , inventories , product warranty , share-based compensation costs , provision for income taxes , deferred income tax asset valuation allowances , uncertain tax positions , tax contingencies , goodwill , intangible assets , investments , and contingencies . we base our estimates on historical experience , applicable laws , and regulations , and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . the methods , estimates , interpretations , and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements . the sec considers an entity 's most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity 's financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity 's most difficult , subjective , or complex judgments , often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain . we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements . revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists , delivery has occurred or title has transferred , the price is fixed or determinable , and collection is reasonably assured , which is generally upon shipment . we accrue for estimated sales returns and other allowances , based on historical experience , at the time we recognize revenue . investments accounting standards require us to record available-for-sale securities at fair value , with unrealized gains and losses being reported as a component of other comprehensive income . we follow the accounting standards to assess whether our investments with loss positions are other-than-temporarily impaired . we follow the hierarchal approach established under the accounting standards to determine fair value of our investments . the accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . our fair value estimates consider , among other factors , the collateral underlying the security investments , creditworthiness of the counterparty , timing of expected future cash flows , and , in the case of ars investments , the probability of a successful auction in a future period . we follow the guidance provided to estimate fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability , and to determine circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly . further , we use judgment in evaluating whether a decline in fair value is temporary or other-than-temporary and consider the following indicators : changes in credit ratings or asset quality ; changes in the economic environment ; length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis ; changes in market conditions ; and changes in expected cash flows . we do not intend to sell the investments and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis . temporary declines in fair value are recorded as charges to accumulated other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet , while other-than-temporary declines in fair value are bifurcated between credit losses , which are charged to earnings , and noncredit losses , which depending on facts and circumstances may be charged to other comprehensive income or earnings . 39 inventory we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market . we base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions . sudden declines in demand , rapid product improvements , or technological changes , or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories . on an ongoing basis , we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions . story_separator_special_tag gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 40.5 % , or $ 208.7 million

specific to an oem customer 's application , gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis , making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs and independent of the vertical markets that our products serve . as a virtual manufacturer , our gross margin percentage is generally not impacted materially by our shipment volume . we charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete , slow moving , and non-usable inventory to net realizable value , including warranty costs , to cost of revenue . operating expenses . research and development expenses . research and development expenses increased as a percentage of net revenue to 16.8 % from 14.4 % , and the cost of research and development activities increased $ 18.5 million , or 27.2 % , to $ 86.6 million in fiscal 2010 compared with $ 68.0 million in fiscal 2009. the increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $ 9.1 million increase in employee compensation and employment related costs , resulting from a 16.1 % increase in research and development staffing , increased base compensation related to our annual performance review process , a $ 5.4 million increase in share-based compensation costs due to a $ 1.5 million cumulative correction to share-based compensation expense in research and development ( see note 8 in the notes to consolidated

$ 6.0 million , or 11.1 % , to $ 60.0 million in fiscal 2010 compared with $ 54.0 million in fiscal 2009. the increase in selling , general , and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $ 4.9 million increase in share-based compensation costs due to a $ 2.7 million cumulative correction to share-based compensation expense in selling , general , and administrative expenses as well as grants made during the year , and a $ 2.4 million increase in employee compensation and employment related costs resulting from a 14.1 % increase in selling , general , and administrative staffing and

expense was $ 2.4 million and $ 7.1 million for fiscal 2010 and 2009 , respectively , and consisted primarily of interest expense , and amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our convertible senior subordinated notes issued in december 2004. the decline in interest expense primarily reflected the retirement of $ 63.0 million in principal amount of our convertible notes in december 2009. impairment of investments . a portion of our ars investments were converted to auction rate preferred stock , and we have seen a decline in the credit ratings for certain of our ars investments . accordingly , based on our fair value analysis and taking into account the period of time the fair value has been less than our cost , we reduced the carrying value of our ars investments by $ 443,000 and $ 9.2 million for fiscal 2010 and 2009 , respectively , through an other-than-temporary impairment charge to income . provision for income taxes . the provision for income

rate for fiscal 2010 was approximately 12.1 % and diverged from the combined federal and state statutory rate , primarily as a result of an increase in profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions , the recognition of tax benefit on the carryback of a prior year net operating loss of $ 1.8 million , the release of unrecognized tax benefits , and the benefit of research tax credits , partially offset by foreign withholding taxes , a write-down of state deferred tax assets , and net unrecognized tax benefits associated with qualified stock options . the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was approximately 13.1 % and diverged from the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily as a result of an increase in profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions , the incremental research credits

Research and development (R&D) expenses rose by 27.2% to $86.6 million, representing 16.8% of net revenue, up from 14.4% in fiscal 2009. This increase was driven by a $9.1 million rise in employee compensation due to a 16.1% increase in R&D staffing, alongside $5.4 million in share-based compensation costs. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses also increased by 11.1% to $60.0 million, or 11.7% of net revenue, with a notable $4.9 million rise in share-based compensation. Operating income decreased to $62.1 million (12.1% of net revenue) from $69.5 million (14.7% of net revenue) in the prior year, primarily due to a $24.5 million increase in operating expenses, despite an 8.8% rise in net revenue. Interest income fell to $1.0 million from $3.2 million, while interest expense decreased to $2.4 million from $7.1 million, reflecting the retirement of $63.0 million in convertible notes.

The provision for income taxes remained stable at approximately $7.3 million for both years, with an effective tax rate of 12.1% in 2010, down from 13.1% in 2009, influenced by profits in lower tax jurisdictions and research tax credits."
53,"these critical accounting policies , which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements , relate to ship accounting , asset impairment and contingencies . ship accounting ships represent our most significant assets , and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation . depreciation of ships is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 % reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship . improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements ' estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship . repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred . we account for dry-dock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all dry-dock costs as incurred . 37 we determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the average useful life of the ships ' major component systems , such as cabins , main diesels , main electric , superstructure and hull . in addition , we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships . given the large and complex nature of our ships , our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain . should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values , depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher . if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized , the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase , partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense . if we reduced our estimated average 30-year ship service life by one year , depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 , 2018 would have increased by $ 13.3 million . in addition , if our ships were estimated to have no residual value , depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by $ 65.9 million . we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied . we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships ' costs to the periods that benefit from the ships ' usage . asset impairment we review our long-lived assets , principally ships , for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable . assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets . we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset . if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows , we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value . we estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates , judgments and projections as necessary . our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk . we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable . for our evaluation of goodwill we use the step 0 test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not ( i.e . , more than 50 % ) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value . in order to make this evaluation , we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist : Â· changes in general macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions ; limitations on accessing capital ; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates ; or other developments in equity and credit markets ; Â· changes in industry and market conditions such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates ; an increased competitive environment ; a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics ( in both absolute terms and relative to peers ) ; a change in the market for an entity 's products or services ; or a regulatory or political development ; Â· changes in cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows ; Â· decline in overall financial performance ( for both actual and expected performance ) ; Â· entity and reporting unit specific negative events such as changes in management , key personnel , strategy , or customers ; litigation ; or a change in the composition or carrying amount of net assets ; and Â· decline in share price ( in both absolute terms and relative to peers ) . we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our long-lived assets , principally ships , goodwill , tradenames and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable . nonetheless , if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets , we could be required to record an impairment charge . if a material change occurred , we may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value , including goodwill . story_separator_special_tag we refer you to the â€œ results of

multi-family mortgage loans . as part of the financing , we received net cash proceeds of approximately $ 55.1 million after deducting expenses associated with the transaction . fourth quarter 2013 common stock dividend on december 10 , 2013 , our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.27 per common share for the quarter ended december 31 , 2013. the dividend was paid on january 27 , 2014 to our common stockholders of record as of december 20 , 2013. preferred stock dividend on december 10 , 2013 , our board of directors declared a series b preferred stock quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.484375 per share of series b preferred stock . the dividend was paid on january 15 , 2014 to our preferred stockholders of record as of january 1 , 2014. subsequent developments on january 10 , 2014 , we closed on the issuance of 11,500,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering ( including 1,500,000 shares issuable pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters ) , resulting in net proceeds of approximately $ 75.8 million after deducting estimated offering expenses . in january 2014 , the company sold a pool of distressed residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of approximately $ 29.4 million for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $ 36.9 million . this sale will result in a net realized gain , before income taxes to the company , of approximately $ 7.5 million . current market conditions and commentar y general . the u.s. economy continued to exhibit mixed results in 2013 , with real gross domestic product ( â€œ gdp â€ ) estimated to have expanded by 1.9 % for the full year , as compared to growth of 2.8 % in 2012. however , the u.s. economy showed signs of expansion during the second half of the year , with gdp growing at an annual rate of 4.1 % and 2.4 % in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 , respectively . according to the u.s. department of labor , the u.s. unemployment rate fell from 7.9 % as of the end of december 2012 to 6.7 % as of the end of december 2013 , while total nonfarm payroll employment posted an average monthly increase of 194,000 jobs in 2013 as compared to an average monthly increase of 181,000 jobs in 2012. while these signs of employment growth are encouraging , the economy continued to produce mixed employment results in 2013 and evidence of a continued decline in the labor force participation rate has raised concerns that the current unemployment rate is not an accurate measure of the economy 's overall health . however , the improved performance of the u.s. economy during the second half of 2013 has contributed to an improved outlook of many u.s. federal reserve , or federal reserve , policymakers in recent months . according to the minutes of a meeting of the federal reserve open market committee ( the â€œ fomc â€ ) of the u.s. federal reserve from december 17-18 , 2013 , most meeting participants expressed greater confidence in their outlook for the u.s. economy and almost all continued to project that the rate of growth of economic activity would strengthen in coming years , projecting gdp growth of 2.8 % to 3.2 % in 2014 and 3.0 % to 3.4 % in 2015. based , in part , on this data , and as more fully discussed below , the fomc announced on december 18 , 2013 that it would commence tapering of asset purchases under qe3 ( defined below ) beginning in january 2014. markets reacted to this news mostly favorably , with many market participants relieved that tapering had finally begun . the federal reserve has undertaken three rounds of quantitative easing in an effort to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation , over time , is at a rate that is most consistent with the federal reserve 's dual mandate of fostering maximum employment and price stability . the most current version of the federal reserve 's quantitative easing program , which is referred to as â€œ qe3 , â€ was originally announced in september 2012 as an open-ended program to purchase an additional $ 40 billion of agency rmbs per month until the unemployment rate , among other economic indicators , showed signs of improvement . this program , when combined with the federal reserve 's programs to extend its holdings ' average maturity , or â€œ operation twist , â€ and reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency rmbs into agency rmbs , was expected to increase the federal reserve 's holdings of long-term securities by approximately $ 85 billion per month through the end of 2012. as â€œ operation twist â€ expired in december 2012 , the federal reserve announced that it would continue purchasing additional agency rmbs by about $ 40 billion per month and longer-term u.s. treasury securities at a pace of $ 45 billion per month , and would continue its policy of reinvesting the principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency rmbs in agency rmbs . this accommodative monetary policy contributed to historically low-levels of interest rates and higher valuations for agency rmbs , resulting in an extremely attractive investment environment for agency rmbs-focused strategies . story_separator_special_tag the company applied pool accounting on distressed residential mortgage loans acquired in 2013 ; distressed residential mortgage loans acquired prior to 2013 are accounted for individually ( i.e . , not in pools ) . under asc 310-30 , the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying amount of the loans , referred to as the â€œ accretable yield , â€ is accreted into interest income over the life of the loans in each pool or individually using a level yield methodology . accordingly , our acquired distressed residential mortgage loans accounted for under asc 310-30 are not subject to classification as nonaccrual classification in the same manner as our residential mortgage loans that were not distressed when acquired by us . rather , interest income on acquired distressed residential mortgage loans relates to the accretable yield recognized at the pool level or on an individual loan basis , and not to contractual interest payments received at the loan level . the difference between contractually required principal and interest payments and the cash flows expected to be collected , referred to as the â€œ non-accretable difference , â€ includes estimates of both the impact of prepayments and expected credit losses over the life of the individual loan , or the pool ( for loans grouped into a pool ) . the company monitors actual cash collections against its expectations , and revised cash flow expectations are prepared as necessary . a decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate that the loan pool or individual loan , as applicable , is impaired thus requiring the establishment of an allowance for loan losses by a charge to the provision for loan losses . an increase in expected cash flows in subsequent periods initially reduces any previously established allowance for loan losses by the increase in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected , and results in a recalculation of the amount of accretable yield for the loan pool . the adjustment of accretable yield due to an increase in expected cash flows is accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate . the additional cash flows expected to be collected are reclassified from the non-accretable difference to the accretable yield , and the amount of periodic accretion is adjusted accordingly over the remaining life of the loans in the pool or individual loan , as applicable . recent accounting pronouncements a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and the possible effects on our financial statements is included in â€œ note 2 â€” summary of significant accounting policies â€ included in item 8 of this annual report on

( 2 ) the company determined it is the primary beneficiary of the consolidated k-series and has consolidated the consolidated k-series into the company 's financial statements . a reconciliation to our financial statements as of december 31 , 2013 follows : multi-family loans held in securitization trusts , at fair value $ 8,111,022 multi-family cdos , at fair value ( 7,871,020 ) net carrying value 240,002 investment securities available for sale , at fair value held in securitization trusts 92,578 total cmbs , at fair value 332,580 first mortgage loan , mezzanine loan and preferred equity investments 27,850 story_separator_special_tag margin-left : 0pt ; margin-right : 0pt `` > 50 other income total other income increased by $ 20.0 million for the year ended december 31 , 2013 as compared to the prior year . the changes in total other income for the year ended december 31 , 2013 as compared to the previous year were primarily driven by : â— an increase in net unrealized gains on multi-family loans and debt held in securitization trusts of $ 24.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2013 as compared to the previous year , primarily due to improved pricing on our multi-family cmbs investments as well as an increase in multi-family cmbs investments as compared to the previous year . as of december 31 , 2013 , the net carrying value of our multi-family cmbs investments , which measures unrealized gains and losses through earnings , amounts to approximately $ 240.0 million as compared to approximately $ 123.3 million at december 31 , 2012 ; â— a decrease in unrealized loss on investment securities and related hedges of $ 9.4 million and a decrease in realized gain on investment securities and related hedges of $ 17.0 million for the year ended december 31 , 2013 , respectively , as compared to the previous year , which is primarily related to our agency io portfolio . increased interest rate volatility combined with illiquidity in the inverse io market resulted in larger than expected losses in this strategy during the second quarter of 2013 , with a partial reversal realized during the third and fourth quarters of 2013 ; and â— an increase in realized gains on distressed residential mortgage loans of $ 1.5 million for the year ended december 31 , 2013 as compared to the previous year . the realized gains are derived from loan refinancings , workouts and resales , with the majority of the realized income in 2013 from loan refinancings . the company 's investment in this asset class did not commence until the fourth quarter of 2012. comparative general , administrative and other expenses ( dollar amounts in thousands ) replace_table_token_8_th the increase in general , administrative and other expenses was largely attributable to the increase in management fees and expenses related to our distressed residential mortgage loan investments . the increase in management fees was driven in large part by the increase in assets managed
","In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company reported net proceeds of $55.1 million from a multi-family CMBS transaction and $136.6 million from other activities. On November 22, 2013, it acquired a first loss PO security in a Freddie Mac-sponsored multifamily K-series securitization, financing it through a master repurchase agreement. The board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per common share and a preferred stock dividend of $0.484375 per share on December 10, 2013. In January 2014, the company raised approximately $75.8 million from an underwritten public offering of 11.5 million shares. Additionally, it sold distressed residential mortgage loans valued at $29.4 million for $36.9 million, realizing a gain of $7.5 million. The U.S. economy showed mixed results in 2013, with GDP growth of 1.9% compared to 2.8% in 2012, but improved in the second half with growth rates of 4.1% and 2.4% in Q3 and Q4, respectively. The unemployment rate decreased from 7.9% at the end of 2012 to 6.7% by December 2013, with an average monthly job increase of 194,000. The Federal Reserve projected GDP growth of 2.8% to 3.2% for 2014 and began tapering asset purchases under QE3 in January 2014. The company's total other income increased by $20 million in 2013, driven by a $24.8 million rise in net unrealized gains on multi-family loans and a decrease in unrealized losses on investment securities.

55,"26 business outlook the global business climate continues to present us with a great deal of uncertainty , making it more difficult to predict future results . factors that could significantly affect our full year 2013 outlook include : unseasonable weather conditions or other unforeseen factors affecting consumer demand and the resulting effect on order cancellations , sales returns , customer accommodations , reorders , direct-to-consumer sales and suppressed demand in subsequent seasons ; changes in mix and volume of full price sales in contrast with closeout product sales and promotional sales activity ; increased costs to support supply chain and information technology infrastructure investments and projects , including our multi-year global enterprise resource planning ( `` erp `` ) system implementation ; our ability to implement and maintain effective cost containment measures in order to limit the growth of selling , general and administrative ( â€œ sg & a â€ ) expenses to a rate comparable to or lower than sales growth ; continued economic uncertainty , which is creating headwinds in key global markets , particularly europe as it relates to our emea direct business where we have ongoing efforts to elevate the columbia brand ; the rate of new store expansion in our direct-to-consumer operations ; changes in consumer spending activity , including consumer acceptance of increased prices of our products ; and fluctuating currency exchange rates . like other branded consumer product companies , our business is heavily dependent upon discretionary consumer spending patterns . continuing high levels of unemployment and concerns about potential consumer price increases in our key markets continue to pose significant challenges and risks . our preliminary 2013 outlook assumes net sales comparable to 2012 net sales , including a decrease in sales in our north american wholesale channels resulting from cautious wholesale customer purchases following back-to-back mild winter weather in 2012 and 2011 , largely offsetting anticipated expansion in our global direct-to-consumer channels and increased sales in the laap region . the combination of these assumptions leads us to anticipate 2013 operating margin ranging from 8.0 percent , comparable to the operating margin realized in 2012 , to approximately 7.5 percent . we are continuing our cost containment measures with the goal of limiting sg & a expense as a percentage of net sales . our previously announced joint venture in mainland china with swire is expected to commence operations effective january 1 , 2014 , subject to regulatory approval in the people 's republic of china and other conditions customary in transactions of this size and type . during 2013 , we will begin accounting for the transition to the joint venture from our current third-party distributor relationship with swire . we expect to fund our approximately $ 50 million share of joint venture capitalization in 2013 and the early part of 2014. our shipments of spring 2014 inventory for the china market , anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2013 , will be sold directly to the joint venture entity . the related sales , gross margin , and licensing income , which we would have recognized in the fourth quarter of 2013 under the distributor model , will be deferred and recognized in future periods as the joint venture sells that inventory to wholesale customers and consumers . similarly , on or about december 31 , 2013 , swire 's inventory of fall 2013 and prior seasons will be transferred to the joint venture . we will defer 2013 profits related to the inventory transferred to the joint venture and recognize those profits as the inventory is sold by the joint venture in future periods . the actual amount of these profit eliminations and deferrals into future periods will be dependent upon the volume of spring 2014 shipments that occur in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the remaining balance of prior season inventory transferred to the joint venture . these adjustments are not currently included in our preliminary 2013 outlook . as these amounts become more predictable , we will refine our 2013 outlook as part of our regular quarterly disclosures . these factors and others may have a material effect on our financial condition , results of operations , or cash flows , particularly with respect to quarterly comparisons . we remain firmly committed to : 27 creating innovative solutions that keep people warm or cool , dry and protected so they can enjoy the outdoors longer ; focusing on product design and utilizing our innovations to differentiate our brands from competitors ; seeking to sell our products through brand enhancing distribution partners around the world ; increasing the impact of consumer communications to drive demand for our brands and sell-through of our products ; making sure our products are merchandised and displayed appropriately in retail environments ; and continuing to build a brand-enhancing direct-to-consumer business . results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report . all references to years relate to the calendar year ended december 31. highlights of the year ended december 31 , 2012 net sales decrease d $ 24.4 million , or 1 % , to $ 1,669.6 million in 2012 from $ 1,694.0 million in 2011 . changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared with 2011 negatively affected the consolidated net sales comparison by approximately one percentage point . net income decrease d 3 % to $ 99.9 million in 2012 from $ 103.5 million in 2011 , and diluted earnings per share decrease d to $ 2.93 in 2012 compared to $ 3.03 in 2011 . we paid cash dividends totaling $ 29.8 million , or $ 0.88 per share , in 2012 . story_separator_special_tag selling , general and administrative expense : sg & a expense increased $ 80.6 million , or 15 % , to $ 614.7 million , or 36.3 % of net sales , in 2011 , from $ 534.1 million , or 36.0 % of net sales , in 2010. the sg & a expense increase was primarily due to : the expansion of direct-to-consumer operations globally , including a net increase of $ 3.2 million in store impairment charges ; increased advertising expenses ; additions to staff and other expenses to support business initiatives and growth ; 33 information technology initiatives , including our erp implementation ; and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation . depreciation and amortization included in sg & a expense totaled $ 42.9 million in 2011 , compared to $ 37.8 million in 2010. net licensing income : net licensing income increased $ 7.8 million , or 98 % , to $ 15.8 million in 2011 from $ 8.0 million in 2010. the increase in net licensing income was primarily due to increased apparel and footwear licensing in the laap region , where a third party distributor is licensed to locally manufacture columbia brand apparel and footwear for sale in local markets . interest income , net : net interest income was $ 1.3 million in 2011 , compared to $ 1.6 million in 2010. the decrease in interest income was primarily driven by lower average cash and investment balances and lower interest rates in 2011 compared to 2010. interest expense was nominal in both 2011 and 2010. income tax expense : income tax expense increased to $ 34.2 million in 2011 from $ 27.9 million in 2010. our effective income tax rate decreased to 24.8 % from 26.6 % in 2010 , primarily because we earned a higher proportion of our income from foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are generally lower than the u.s. tax rate . net income : net income increased $ 26.4 million , or 34 % , to $ 103.5 million in 2011 from $ 77.0 million in 2010. diluted earnings per share was $ 3.03 in 2011 compared to $ 2.26 in 2010. liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing funding requirements are for working capital , investing activities associated with the expansion of our global operations and general corporate needs . at december 31 , 2012 , we had total cash and cash equivalents of $ 290.8 million compared to $ 241.0 million at december 31 , 2011 . in addition , we had short-term investments of $ 44.7 million at december 31 , 2012 compared to $ 2.9 million at december 31 , 2011 . at december 31 , 2012 , approximately 30 % of our cash and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries where a repatriation of those funds to the united states would likely result in a significant tax expense to the company . however , based on the capital and liquidity needs of our foreign operations , as well as the status of current tax law , it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the united states . in addition , our united states operations do not require the repatriation of these funds to meet our currently projected liquidity needs . 2012 compared to 2011 story_separator_special_tag style= `` line-height:120 % ;

","The global business climate remains uncertain, impacting the 2013 outlook, which anticipates net sales comparable to 2012's $1,669.6 million, despite a projected decrease in North American wholesale sales due to mild winters in 2011 and 2012. Operating margins are expected to range from 7.5% to 8.0%, similar to 2012's margin. The company faces challenges from unseasonable weather, changes in consumer spending, and increased costs related to supply chain and IT investments, including a $50 million ERP system implementation. In 2012, net sales decreased by $24.4 million (1%) from 2011, with net income down 3% to $99.9 million. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose by 15% to $614.7 million, accounting for 36.3% of net sales. The company plans to transition to a joint venture in China, with operations starting January 1, 2014, and anticipates deferring profits related to inventory transfers to the joint venture. As of December 31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents totaled $290.8 million, up from $241.0 million in 2011, with short-term investments increasing to $44.7 million. The company is committed to innovative product solutions and enhancing brand presence while managing costs effectively."
56,"we determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the average useful life of the ships ' major component systems , such as cabins , main diesels , main electric , superstructure and hull . in addition , we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships . given the large and complex nature of our ships , our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain . should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values , depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher . if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized , the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase , partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense . if we reduced our estimated average 30-year ship service life by one year , depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 , 2014 would have 39 increased by $ 7.3 million . in addition , if our ships were estimated to have no residual value , depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by $ 36.5 million . we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied . we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships ' costs to the periods that benefit from the ships ' usage . asset impairment we review our long-lived assets , principally ships , for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable . assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets . we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset . if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows , we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value . we estimate fair value based on the best information available making whatever estimates , judgments and projections considered necessary . the estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the risk involved . goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets , principally tradenames , are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of these assets could not be fully recovered . we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our long-lived assets , principally ships , and goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable . nonetheless , if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets , we could be required to record an impairment charge . as of december 31 , 2014 , our annual review supports the carrying value of these assets . contingencies periodically , we assess potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us or any asserted claims , including tax , legal and or environmental matters . although it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions , we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss , if any , can be made . in assessing probable losses , we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries , if any . in accordance with the guidance on accounting for contingencies , we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated . due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries , although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable , it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimated provisions or previous disclosures . non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures , such as net revenue , adjusted net revenue , net yield , adjusted net yield , net cruise cost , adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel , adjusted ebitda , adjusted net income and adjusted eps , to enable us to analyze our performance . see â€œ terms used in this annual report â€ for the definition of these non-gaap financial measures . we utilize net revenue and net yield to manage our business on a day-to-day basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs . in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income , we believe changes in net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance . as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of north america , a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies , particularly euro and british pound sterling , which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency , the u.s. dollar . story_separator_special_tag liquidity and capital resources general as of december 31 , 2014 , our liquidity was $ 509.8 million consisting of $ 84.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $ 425.0 million available under our revolving credit facility . our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital , capital expenditures and debt service . as of december 31 , 2014 , we had a working capital deficit of $ 1.8 billion . this deficit included $ 817.2 million of advance ticket sales , which represents the total revenue we collect in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities . our business model , along with our revolving credit facility , allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating , investing and financing needs . our existing debt agreements restrict , and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict , among other things , the ability of our subsidiaries , including nclc , to pay distributions to nclh and our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders . we are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to us to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh . however , we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations . 47 story_separator_special_tag cellspacing= `` 0 `` style= `` font : 10pt times new roman , times , serif ; margin-top : 0pt ;

","As of December 31, 2014, the company assessed the useful life of its ships, primarily estimating an average service life of 30 years, with significant components like cabins and hulls influencing this estimate. A one-year reduction in this estimate would have increased depreciation expense by $7.3 million, while assuming no residual value would have raised it by $36.5 million. The company reviews long-lived assets for impairment, comparing carrying amounts to estimated future cash flows, and as of the same date, it maintained a liquidity of $509.8 million, comprising $84.8 million in cash and $425 million in available credit. Despite a working capital deficit of $1.8 billion, including $817.2 million in advance ticket sales, the company believes it can meet its operational needs. The company also utilizes non-GAAP financial measures to analyze performance, with a focus on net revenue and adjusted net cruise costs. As of the end of 2014, 53% of its debt was fixed and 47% variable, with $1.3 billion in notional debt linked to interest rate swaps. The company is exposed to market risks from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and fuel prices, and employs derivatives to mitigate these risks."

/foreclosed assets and accrued interest on loans for up to 90 days . the fdic will absorb 80 % of losses and share in 80 % of loss recoveries on the covered assets acquired from granite . the loss sharing arrangements for non-single family residential and single family residential loans are in effect for 5 years and 10 years , respectively , and the loss recovery provisions are in effect for 8 years and 10 years , respectively , from the acquisition date . with this agreement , the bank added one traditional bank branch in each of granite bay and auburn , california . this acquisition is consistent with the bank 's community banking expansion strategy and provides further opportunity to fill in the bank 's market presence in the greater sacramento , california market . 22 the company refers to loans and foreclosed assets that are covered by loss sharing agreements as Â“covered loansÂ” and Â“covered foreclosed assetsÂ” , respectively . in addition , the company refers to loans purchased or obtained in a business combination as Â“purchased credit impairedÂ” ( pci ) loans , or Â“purchased non-credit impairedÂ” ( pnci ) loans . the company refers to loans that it originates as Â“originatedÂ” loans . additional information regarding the citizens and granite bank acquisitions can be found in note 2 in the financial statements at item 8 of this report . additional information regarding the definitions and accounting for originated , pnci and pci loans can be found in notes 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 in the financial statements at item 8 of this report , and under the heading asset quality and non-performing assets below . geographical descriptions for the purpose of describing the geographical location of the company 's loans , the company has defined northern california as that area of california north of , and including , stockton ; central california as that area of the state south of stockton , to and including , bakersfield ; and southern california as that area of the state south of bakersfield . results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis is designed to provide a better understanding of the significant changes and trends related to the company and the bank 's financial condition , operating results , asset and liability management , liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes at item 8 of this report . following is a summary of the components of net income for the periods indicated ( dollars in thousands ) : replace_table_token_4_th net interest income the company 's primary source of revenue is net interest income , which is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities . following is a summary of the company 's net interest income for the periods indicated ( dollars in thousands ) : replace_table_token_5_th net interest income ( fte ) for the year ended december 31 , 2011 was $ 93,053,000 , an increase of $ 2,201,000 or 2.4 % compared to the year ended december 31 , 2010. the increase in net interest income during 2011 when compared to 2010 is mainly due to the acquisition of citizens on september 23 , 2011 and its associated net interest income of $ 6,117,000 from september 23 , 2011 to december 31 , 2011. included in the net interest income associated with the citizens acquisition is $ 3,146,000 from the accretion of loan purchase discounts . also contributing to the increase in net interest income was a reduction in deposit rates and the flow of deposits from relatively higher paying time deposits to lower paying non-maturity deposits . partially offsetting the increase in net interest income related to the citizens acquisition and the deposit rate and volume changes were organic loan payoffs in excess of loan production during 2011. these loan payoffs in excess of loan production and deposit growth during 2011 were deployed into lower yielding short-term interest-earning balances at the federal reserve bank . during 2011 , investment opportunities continued to be unattractive given their low market yields and interest rate risk profile . 23 net interest income ( fte ) for the year ended december 31 , 2010 was $ 90,852,000 , a decrease of $ 1,438,000 or 1.6 % compared to the year ended december 31 , 2009. this decrease in net interest income was attributable to a change in the mix of interest-earning assets , with average loan balances decreasing and other categories of lower yielding assets increasing . the decrease in average loan balances was due to decreased loan demand and unfavorable credit risks associated with loans in the economic environment that persisted throughout 2010. while the company was able to continue to lower interest-bearing liability rates , and thus interest expense , sufficiently to overcome the decrease in interest income due to decreases in the average yield on interest-earning assets during 2010 , it was not sufficient to overcome the decrease in average loan balances during 2010. the Â“yieldÂ” and Â“volume/rateÂ” tables shown below are useful in illustrating and quantifying the developments that affected net interest income during 2010. summary of average balances , yields/rates and interest differential Â– yield tables the following tables present , for the periods indicated , information regarding the company 's consolidated average assets , liabilities and shareholders ' equity , the amounts of interest income from average earning assets and resulting yields , and the amount of interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities . average loan balances include nonperforming loans . story_separator_special_tag 2011. demand for home equity loans and lines of credit was weak to modest during 2011. real estate construction loans declined during 2011 as did auto dealer loans . at december 31 , 2010 loans , including net deferred loan costs , totaled $ 1,419,571,000 which was a 5.1 % ( $ 75,999,000 ) decrease over the balances at the end of 2009. this decrease in loans during 2010 was net of $ 64,802,000 of loans acquired in the granite acquisition on may 28 , 2010. demand for commercial real estate ( real estate mortgage ) loans was weak during 2010. demand for home equity loans and lines of credit were weak to modest during 2010. real estate construction loans declined during 2010 as did auto dealer loans . asset quality and nonperforming assets nonperforming assets loans originated by the company , i.e . , not purchased or acquired in a business combination , are reported at the principal amount outstanding , net of deferred loan fees and costs . loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred , and the net amount is amortized as an adjustment of the related loan 's yield over the actual life of the loan . originated loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans . originated loans are placed in nonaccrual status when reasonable doubt exists as to the full , timely collection of interest or principal , or a loan becomes contractually past due by 90 days or more with respect to interest or principal and is not well secured and in the process of collection . when an originated loan is placed on nonaccrual status , all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed . income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and where the future collection of principal is probable . interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when , in the judgment of management , the loan is estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest . 30 an allowance for loan losses for originated loans is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense . originated loans and deposit related overdrafts are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely or , with respect to consumer installment loans , according to an established delinquency schedule . the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in existing loans and leases , based on evaluations of the collectability , impairment and prior loss experience of loans and leases . the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the portfolio , overall portfolio quality , loan concentrations , specific problem loans , and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower 's ability to pay . the company defines an originated loan as impaired when it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement . impaired originated loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan 's original effective interest rate . as a practical expedient , impairment may be measured based on the loan 's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent . when the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan , the impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance . in situations related to originated loans where , for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower 's financial difficulties , the company grants a concession for other than an insignificant period of time to the borrower that the company would not otherwise consider , the related loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring ( tdr ) . the company strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify to more affordable terms before their loan reaches nonaccrual status . these modified terms may include rate reductions , principal forgiveness , payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral . in cases where the company grants the borrower new terms that provide for a reduction of either interest or principal , the company measures any impairment on the restructuring as noted above for impaired loans . tdr loans are classified as impaired until they are fully paid off or charged off . loans that are in nonaccrual status at the time they become tdr loans , remain in nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance which the company generally believes to be six consecutive months of payments , or equivalent . otherwise , tdr loans are subject to the same nonaccrual and charge-off policies as noted above with respect to their restructured principal balance . credit risk is inherent in the business of lending . as a result , the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the company 's originated loan portfolio . this is maintained through periodic charges to earnings . these charges are included in the consolidated income statements as provision for loan losses . all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance . however , for a variety of reasons , not all losses are immediately known to the company and , of those that are known , the full extent of the loss may not be quantifiable at that point in time . the balance of the company 's allowance for originated loan losses is meant to be an estimate of these unknown but probable losses inherent in the
","Under a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC, the bank will cover a significant portion of future losses on loans, unfunded loan commitments, foreclosed assets, and accrued interest for up to 90 days, absorbing 80% of losses and sharing in 80% of recoveries on covered assets acquired from Granite. The loss sharing for non-single family residential loans lasts 5 years, while single-family residential loans are covered for 10 years, with recovery provisions in effect for 8 and 10 years, respectively. The bank expanded its presence by adding branches in Granite Bay and Auburn, California, aligning with its community banking strategy. In 2011, net interest income (FTE) was $93,053,000, a 2.4% increase from $90,852,000 in 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Citizens Bank, which contributed $6,117,000 in net interest income from September 23 to December 31, 2011. The bank's loan portfolio totaled $1,419,571,000 at the end of 2010, reflecting a 5.1% decrease from 2009, influenced by weak demand for home equity and commercial real estate loans. The allowance for loan losses is maintained through periodic charges to earnings, with specific losses charged off against the allowance. The bank aims to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early to modify loans and minimize losses, with troubled debt restructurings classified as impaired until fully paid off or charged off."

2018 . the effective tax rate increased to 22.6 % in fiscal 2019 from ( 48.3 ) % in fiscal 2018 . the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the one-time benefit of the adoption of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act ( `` tax reform act `` ) in the prior year . net income decreased to $ 203,886 in fiscal 2019 from $ 317,903 in fiscal 2018 . the decrease was mainly due to the adoption

replace_table_token_50_th the following table presents a reconciliation of certain non-gaap performance measures and ratios used by the company to evaluate and measure the company 's performance to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures for the last five years . replace_table_token_51_th replace_table_token_52_th replace_table_token_53_th ( 1 ) the company considers acquisition and non-operating compensation charges incurred prior to 2015 to be insignificant . replace_table_token_54_th overview and strategy 2015 highlights the company recorded net income of $ 156.7 million for the year of 2015 compared to $ 151.4 million and $ 137.2 million for the years of 2014 and 2013 , respectively . the results for 2015 demonstrate continued operating strengths including strong loan and deposit growth driving higher net interest income , increased mortgage banking revenue , higher fees from covered call options and customer interest rate swaps and stable credit quality metrics . the company increased its loan portfolio , excluding covered loans , from $ 14.4 billion at december 31 , 2014 to $ 17.1 billion at december 31 , 2015 . this increase was primarily a result of the company 's commercial banking initiative , growth in the commercial real estate and life insurance premium finance receivables portfolios and acquisitions during the period . the company is focused on making new loans , including in the commercial and commercial real estate sector , where opportunities that meet our underwriting standards exist . for more information regarding changes in the company 's loan portfolio , see â€œ analysis of financial condition â€“ interest earning assets â€ and note 4 â€œ loans â€ of the consolidated financial statements presented under item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk . accordingly , during 2015 , the company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations . in this regard , the company benefited from its strong deposit base , a liquid short-term investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources including the issuance of the series d preferred stock ( as defined below ) in 2015. at december 31 , 2015 , the company had overnight liquid funds and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $ 883.6 million compared to $ 1.2 billion at december 31 , 2014 . the company recorded net interest income of $ 641.5 million in 2015 compared to $ 598.6 million and $ 550.6 million in 2014 and 2013 , respectively . the higher level of net interest income recorded in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from a $ 2.1 billion increase in the balance of average loans , excluding covered loans . the increase in average loans , excluding covered loans , was partially offset by a 20 basis point decline in the yield on earning assets as well as an increase in borrowings under the company 's term credit facility in 2015 and an increase in borrowings from the issuance of subordinated debt and the completion of the canadian secured borrowing transaction in 2014. non-interest income totaled $ 271.6 million in 2015 , increasing $ 56.4 million , or 26 % , compared to 2014 . the increase in non-interest income in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking revenues , higher fees from covered call options , higher fees from customer interest rate swap fees and an increase in service charges on deposits ( see `` non-interest income `` section later in this item 7 for further detail ) . non-interest expense totaled $ 628.4 million in 2015 , increasing $ 81.6 million , or 15 % , compared to 2014 . the increase compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to $ 14.0 million in acquisition and non-operating compensation charges , $ 42.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits , increased equipment and occupancy , data processing and professional fees , and higher marketing expenses , partially offset by a reduction in oreo expenses . the increase in salaries and employee benefits was , specifically , attributable to a $ 17.2 million increase in salaries resulting from additional employees from acquisitions and larger staffing as the company grew , a $ 16.5 million increase in commissions and incentive compensation primarily attributable to the company 's long-term incentive program , and an $ 8.3 million increase in employee benefits due to higher insurance costs . the current economic environment the economic environment in 2015 was characterized by continued low interest rates and continued competition as banks have experienced improvements in their financial condition allowing them to be more active in the lending market . the company has employed certain strategies to manage net income in the current rate environment , including those discussed below . net interest income the company has leveraged its internal loan pipeline and external growth opportunities to grow its earning assets base . the company has also continued its efforts to shift a greater portion of its deposit base to non-interest bearing deposits . story_separator_special_tag financing of life insurance premiums as with the commercial premium finance business , the primary driver of profitability related to the financing of life insurance premiums is the net interest spread that fifc can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit . profitability of financing both commercial and life insurance premiums is also meaningfully impacted by leveraging information technology systems , maintaining operational efficiency and increasing average loan size , each of which allows us to expand our loan volume without significant capital investment . wealth management we offer a full range of wealth management services including trust and investment services , asset management solutions , securities brokerage services , and 401 ( k ) and retirement plan services through three separate subsidiaries ( whi , ctc and great lakes advisors ) . the primary drivers of profitability of the wealth management business can be associated with the level of commission received related to the trading performed by the brokerage customers for their accounts and the amount of assets under management for which investments , asset management and trust units receive a management fee for advisory , administrative and custodial services . as such , revenues are influenced by a rise or fall in the debt and equity markets and the resulting increase or decrease in the value of our client accounts on which our fees are based . the commissions received by the brokerage unit are not as directly influenced by the directionality of the debt and equity markets but rather the desire of our customers to engage in trading based on their particular situations and outlooks of the market or particular stocks and bonds . profitability in the brokerage business is impacted by commissions which fluctuate over time . financial regulatory reform the dodd-frank act contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets . our banking regulators have introduced , and continue to introduce , new regulations , supervisory guidance , and enforcement actions related to the dodd-frank act . we are unable to predict the nature , extent , or impact of any additional changes to statutes or regulations , including the interpretation , implementation , or enforcement thereof , which may occur in the future . the exact impact of the changing regulatory environment on our business and operations depends upon the final implementing regulations and the actions of our competitors , customers , and other market participants . however , the changes mandated by the dodd-frank act , as well as other possible legislative and regulatory changes , generally could have a significant impact on us by , for example , requiring us to change our business practices ; requiring us to meet more stringent capital , liquidity and leverage ratio requirements ; limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities ; imposing additional costs and compliance obligations on us ; limiting fees we can charge for services ; impacting the value of our assets ; or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and our earnings ' capabilities . we have already experienced significant increases in compliance related costs and we expect that compliance with the dodd-frank act and its implementing regulations will require us to invest significant additional management attention and resources . we will continue to monitor the impact that the implementation of applicable rules , regulations and policies arising out of the dodd-frank act will have on our organization . recent rules regarding mortgage origination and servicing the cfpb has indicated that the mortgage industry is an area of supervisory focus . in 2013 , the cfpb released final regulations governing a wide variety of mortgage origination and servicing practices to implement provisions of the dodd-frank act . among other things , these regulations require mortgage lenders to assess and verify borrowers ' â€œ ability to pay â€ and establish a safe harbor for mortgages that meet certain criteria . for mortgages that do not meet the safe harbor 's criteria , the dodd-frank act provides for enhanced liability for the mortgage lender as well as assignees . the cfpb 's new regulations also cover compensation of loan officers and brokers , escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance , mortgage billing statements , force-placed insurance , and servicing practices with respect to delinquent borrowers and loss mitigation procedures . we have centralized our mortgage origination and servicing operations and implemented compliance programs for each of these new requirements as applicable to our business . for further discussion of the rules related to mortgage origination and servicing and our compliance see â€œ business - supervision and regulation . â€ in addition to changes to the specific regulations governing our mortgage business , regulatory enforcement policies remain an important consideration in the operation of our business . in 2012 , for example , the largest mortgage lenders and servicers entered into settlements with federal and state regulators regarding mortgage origination and servicing practices . while the company and replace_table_token_59_th the banks ( including the wintrust mortgage division of barrington bank ) were not parties to these settlements , and are not subject to examination by the cfpb , the terms of the settlements may influence regulators ' future actions and expectations of mortgage lenders generally . there are additional proposals to further amend some of these statutes and their implementing regulations , and there may be additional proposals or final amendments in 2016 or beyond . for example , proposals to reform the residential mortgage market may include changes to the operations of fannie mae and freddie mac ( including potential winding down of operations ) , and reduction of mortgage loan products available in federal housing administration programs . developments related to capital in july 2013 , the u.s. federal banking agencies approved sweeping regulatory capital reforms and promulgated rules effecting changes required by the dodd-frank act
","Management evaluates the company's equity using the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share, while profitability is assessed through the return on average tangible common equity. Operating net income, which excludes acquisition and non-operating compensation charges, is considered a key performance measure. In 2015, the company reported net income of $156.7 million, an increase from $151.4 million in 2014 and $137.2 million in 2013. The loan portfolio grew from $14.4 billion at the end of 2014 to $17.1 billion by the end of 2015, driven by commercial banking initiatives and acquisitions. Net interest income rose to $641.5 million in 2015, up from $598.6 million in 2014, attributed to a $2.1 billion increase in average loans. Non-interest income also increased by 26% to $271.6 million, primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges. However, non-interest expenses rose to $628.4 million, a 15% increase from 2014, largely due to acquisition-related costs and higher salaries. The company maintained adequate liquidity with overnight liquid funds of $883.6 million at the end of 2015, down from $1.2 billion in 2014. The economic environment in 2015 was characterized by low interest rates and increased competition among banks. The company is also adapting to regulatory changes under the Dodd-Frank Act, which may impose additional compliance costs and affect business practices."
63,"however , we could increase or decrease the number of wells that we drill depending on oil and natural gas prices . we do not specifically budget for acquisitions as the timing and size of acquisitions are not predictable . 43 we use the successful efforts method of accounting , which allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration activities . accordingly , our exploration costs consist of costs we incur to acquire and reprocess 3-d seismic data , impairments of our unevaluated leasehold where we were not successful in discovering reserves and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells that we drill . we generally sell our oil and natural gas at current market prices at the point our wells connect to third party purchaser pipelines . we have entered into certain gathering and treating agreements with midstream companies to transport a substantial portion of our natural gas production in north louisiana , to long-haul gas pipelines . in addition , we have also entered into agreements for firm transportation of 80,000 mmbtus per day of natural gas on long-haul pipelines . we market our products several different ways depending upon a number of factors , including the availability of purchasers for the product , the availability and cost of pipelines near our wells , market prices , pipeline constraints and operational flexibility . accordingly , our revenues are heavily dependent upon the prices of , and demand for , oil and natural gas . oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future . our operating costs are generally comprised of several components , including costs of field personnel , insurance , repair and maintenance costs , production supplies , fuel used in operations , transportation costs , workover expenses and state production and ad valorem taxes . like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies , we face the constant challenge of replacing our reserves . although in the past we have offset the effect of declining production rates from existing properties through successful acquisition and drilling efforts , there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offset production declines or maintain production at current rates through future acquisitions or drilling activity . our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add new reserves in excess of production . our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal , state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for , and the development , production and transportation of , oil and natural gas , and operating safety . future laws or regulations , any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations and financial condition . applicable environmental regulations require us to remove our equipment after production has ceased , to plug and abandon our wells and to remediate any environmental damage our operations may have caused . the present value of the estimated future costs to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells and to dismantle and remove our production facilities is included in our reserve for future abandonment costs , which was $ 14.0 million as of december 31 , 2011 . 44 results of operations year ended december 31 , 2011 compared to year ended december 31 , 2010 our operating data for 2010 and 2011 is summarized below : replace_table_token_15_th ( 1 ) includes ad valorem taxes . ( 2 ) represents depreciation , depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties only . oil and gas sales . our oil and gas sales increased $ 85.2 million ( 24 % ) in 2011 to $ 434.4 million from sales of $ 349.1 million in 2010. this increase resulted from higher natural gas production and higher prices realized for crude oil sales in 2011. our production in 2011 increased by 31 % over 2010 's production as our successful drilling in the haynesville/bossier and eagle ford shale formations exceeded declines from our existing producing properties . prices realized for crude oil sales increased by 40 % in 2011 as compared to 2010 while the average price we realized for natural gas sales decreased by 10 % in 2011 as compared to 2010. during 2011 we drilled 87 wells ( 47.7 net to us ) , 62 of which were haynesville or bossier shale horizontal wells and 20 of which were eagle ford shale horizontal wells . at december 31 , 2011 we had 23 wells ( 15.5 net to us ) that were drilled in 2011 awaiting completion . production taxes . production taxes decreased $ 6.2 million ( 63 % ) to $ 3.7 million in 2011 from $ 9.9 million in 2010. our haynesville and bossier shale wells , which comprise a large percentage of our production , qualify for exemption from certain state production taxes . the exempt wells together with the lower natural gas prices account for the decrease . gathering and transportation . gathering and transportation costs in 2011 increased $ 11.2 million ( 65 % ) to $ 28.5 million as compared to $ 17.3 million in 2010 due to the transportation costs related to the higher production from our haynesville/bossier shale properties in north louisiana . lease operating expenses . story_separator_special_tag interest and penalties resulting from audits by tax authorities have been immaterial and are included in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations . at december 31 , 2011 we had u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 63.2 million and louisiana state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 484.5 million . utilization of $ 36.9 million of our u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards is limited to approximately $ 1.1 million per year pursuant to a prior change of control of an acquired company and a valuation allowance of $ 23.0 million has been established for the estimated u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards that will not be utilized . realization of the remaining u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards requires comstock to generate taxable income within the carryforward period . a valuation allowance of $ 222.8 million has been established against our louisiana state net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of generating taxable income in the state of louisiana prior to the expiration of the carryforward period . critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and use assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenues or expenses . successful efforts accounting . we are required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies . there are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities . the full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with finding oil and natural gas reserves , including certain general and administrative expenses . the successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration projects . costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive oil and gas reserves were not found . we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas activities and we do not capitalize any of our general and administrative expenses . oil and natural gas reserve quantities . the determination of depreciation , depletion and amortization expense is highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties . the determination of whether impairments should be recognized on our oil 51 and gas properties is also dependent on these estimates , as well as estimates of probable reserves . reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that can not be precisely measured . the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data , production history and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment . because all reserve estimates are to some degree imprecise , the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered , production and operating costs , the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas prices may all differ materially from those assumed in these estimates . the information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties . thus , such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year 's estimates . such revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities , production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices . any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition , our borrowing ability , our future prospects and the value of our common stock . impairment of oil and gas properties . we evaluate our properties on a field area basis for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable . if impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the asset 's carrying value to its undiscounted expected future net cash flows , then it is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value . a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events . expected future cash flows are determined using estimated future prices based on market based forward prices applied to projected future production volumes . the projected production volumes are based on the property 's proved and risk adjusted probable oil and natural gas reserve estimates at the end of the period . the estimated future cash flows that we use in our assessment of the need for an impairment are based on market prices for oil and natural gas for the next three years , with a 5 % escalation of prices for subsequent years . prices are not escalated to levels that exceed observed historical market prices . costs are also assumed to escalate at a rate that is based on our historical experience , currently estimated at 2 % per annum . the oil and natural gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows because the standardized measure requires the use of the average first day of the month historical price for the year . to the extent that oil and natural gas prices do not increase as anticipated in these assumptions or costs increase at a greater rate than assumed , certain of our evaluated properties which presently have a carrying value of $ 146.7 million may require impairment in the future . the amount of such impairments would be based on the write down of these properties to their then current estimated fair value .
","As of December 31, 2011, the company reported oil and gas sales of $434.4 million, a 24% increase from $349.1 million in 2010, driven by a 31% rise in production and a 40% increase in crude oil prices, despite a 10% decrease in natural gas prices. The company drilled 87 wells in 2011, with 62 in the Haynesville/Bossier. Gathering and transportation costs rose 65% to $28.5 million due to increased production, while production taxes fell 63% to $3.7 million, attributed to exemptions for certain wells. The company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting, capitalizing only costs related to proven properties and successful exploration, with a reserve for future abandonment costs of $14 million. As of December 31, 2011, the company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $63.2 million and Louisiana state carryforwards of about $484.5 million, with significant valuation allowances due to uncertainty in generating taxable income. The company faces challenges in replacing reserves and is subject to extensive regulations, which could impact operations and financial condition. Future cash flows and potential impairments of properties, currently valued at $146.7 million, depend on market prices and production estimates, with a 5% price escalation assumed beyond three years."
64,"since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during the peak demand periods of lunch and dinner , and given our relatively high average sales per productive square foot , we generally do not expect to achieve sustained increases in comparable sales in excess of our annual effective menu price increases for our mature restaurants , assuming we are able to retain our guest traffic levels in those restaurants . therefore , we currently expect that the majority of our year-over-year revenue growth for fiscal 2012 will be derived from new restaurant openings and the carryover impact of partial-year openings during 2011. newly opened restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher cost of sales , labor and direct operating and occupancy costs for several months after their opening in both percentage and dollar terms when compared with our more mature , established restaurants . accordingly , the number and timing of newly opened restaurants has had , and is expected to continue to have , an impact on restaurant opening expenses , cost of sales , labor and occupancy and operating expenses . additionally , initial restaurant openings in new markets may experience even greater inefficiencies for several months , if not longer , due to lower initial sales volumes , which results from initially low consumer awareness levels , and a lack of supply chain and other operating cost leverage until additional restaurants can be opened in the markets . our revenues are comprised of food and beverage sales at our restaurants . revenues from restaurant sales are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale . revenues from our gift cards are recognized upon redemption in our restaurants . gift card breakage is recognized as other income on our consolidated statements of income . gift card breakage is recorded when the likelihood of the redemption of the gift cards becomes remote , which is typically after 24 months from original gift card issuance . cost of sales is comprised of food and beverage costs . the components of cost of sales are variable and typically fluctuate directly with sales volumes . labor and benefit costs include direct hourly and management wages , bonuses and payroll taxes and fringe benefits for restaurant employees including stock-based compensation that is directly related to restaurant level team members . occupancy and operating expenses include restaurant supplies , credit card fees , marketing costs , fixed rent , percentage rent , common area maintenance charges , utilities , real estate taxes , repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs . general and administrative costs include all corporate , field supervision and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth . components of this category include corporate management , field supervision and corporate hourly staff salaries and related employee benefits ( including stock-based compensation expense ) , travel and relocation costs , information systems , the cost to recruit and train new restaurant management employees , corporate rent and professional and consulting fees . depreciation and amortization principally include depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants . restaurant opening expenses , which are expensed as incurred , consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial hourly work force for each new restaurant , travel , the cost of food and supplies used in training , grand opening promotional costs , the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a restaurant , including rent during the construction and in-restaurant training period . while we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases , no guarantee can be given that such leases will be renewed or , if renewed , that rents will not increase substantially . we currently have a lease for one of our smaller format bj 's pizza & grill Â® restaurants scheduled to expire during the next twelve months . our plan is to close and relocate this smaller format restaurant to another location in the same general trade area that can accommodate a large format bj 's restaurant & brewhouse Â® restaurant during fiscal year 2012 . 47 in calculating comparable company-owned restaurant sales , we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for 18 months . guest traffic for our restaurants is estimated based on values assigned to certain menu items or individual guest tickets . results of operations the following table sets forth , for the years indicated , our consolidated statements of income expressed as percentages of total revenues . fiscal 2011 consists of 53 weeks . all other fiscal years presented consist of 52 weeks . replace_table_token_6_th 53 weeks ended january 3 , 2012 ( fiscal 2011 ) compared to the 52 weeks ended december 28 , 2010 ( fiscal 2010 ) revenues . total revenues increased by $ 107.0 million , or 20.8 % , to $ 620.9 million during fiscal 2011 from $ 513.9 million during fiscal 2010. the increase in revenues consisted of an increase of approximately $ 62.0 million in sales from new restaurants not yet in our comparable sales base ; an approximate $ 31.1 million , or 6.6 % , increase in comparable restaurant sales on a 52 week basis ; and $ 13.9 million of sales due to the 53 rd week . on a 52 week basis , the increase in comparable restaurant sales resulted from an estimated effective menu price increase factor of approximately 3.0 % , coupled with an estimated 2.2 % benefit from increased guest traffic and an estimated 1.4 % benefit from a favorable menu mix shift and guest purchase incidence rates . our restaurants , like most in casual dining , are impacted by inflationary pressures for the costs of certain commodities , labor and other operating expenses . story_separator_special_tag labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by $ 29.1 million , or 19.5 % , to $ 178.2 million during fiscal 2010 compared to $ 149.1 million during fiscal 2009. this increase was primarily due to the opening of 10 new restaurants during fiscal 2010. as a percentage of revenues , labor and benefit costs decreased to 34.7 % during fiscal 2010 from 34.9 % in the prior fiscal year . this decrease was primarily related to our ability to leverage our fixed and semi-fixed labor costs over a higher revenue base as a result of comparable sales increases , partially offset by higher manager bonuses ( due to the improved productivity and efficiency of our restaurant operations during the year ) and comparatively higher equity compensation , since the prior fiscal year included a cumulative favorable forfeiture rate adjustment related to our stock-based compensation . included in labor and benefits for fiscal 2010 and 2009 was approximately $ 1.1 million and $ 0.6 million , or 0.2 % and 0.1 % of revenues , respectively , of stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units granted in accordance with our gold standard stock ownership program . occupancy and operating . occupancy and operating expenses increased by $ 17.4 million , or 18.8 % , to $ 109.6 million during fiscal 2010 compared to $ 92.2 million during fiscal 2009. the increase reflected additional operating and occupancy expenses related to our 10 new restaurants that were opened during fiscal 2010. as a percentage of revenues , occupancy and operating expenses decreased to 21.3 % for fiscal 2010 from 21.6 % for the prior fiscal year . this percentage decrease was due to our ability to leverage the fixed and semi-fixed components of these expenses as a result of our comparable sales increases , coupled with lower marketing expenditures and partially offset by higher general liability insurance costs . general and administrative . general and administrative expenses increased by $ 5.1 million , or 17.5 % , to $ 34.6 million during fiscal 2010 compared to $ 29.5 million during fiscal 2009. also included in general and administrative costs for fiscal 2010 and 2009 was $ 2.9 million and $ 2.3 million , respectively , of stock-based compensation expense . the overall increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to planned higher field supervision and support costs , coupled with higher legal and consulting expenses and incentive compensation as a result of better-than-planned financial performance for fiscal 2010. as a percentage of revenues , general and administrative expenses decreased to 6.7 % for fiscal 2010 from 6.9 % for the prior fiscal year . this percentage decrease was due to our ability to leverage the fixed component of these expenses over a higher revenue base as a result of comparable sales increases . depreciation and amortization . depreciation and amortization increased by $ 4.8 million , or 19.7 % , to $ 28.9 million during fiscal 2010 compared to $ 24.1 million during fiscal 2009. as a percentage of revenues , 52 depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.6 % for fiscal 2010 from 5.7 % for the prior fiscal year . this percentage decrease was primarily due to our ability to leverage the fixed nature of these costs as a result of comparable sales increases . restaurant opening . restaurant opening expenses decreased by $ 0.1 million , or 2.6 % , to $ 5.2 million during fiscal 2010 compared to $ 5.3 million during fiscal 2009. we opened 10 new restaurants during both fiscal 2010 and 2009. our opening costs will fluctuate from period to period , depending upon , but not limited to , the number of restaurant openings , the size and concept of the restaurants being opened , the location of the restaurants and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process . see Â“business Â– restaurant opening expensesÂ” in part i , item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. loss on disposal of assets . loss on disposal of assets increased by $ 0.9 million , to $ 1.2 million during fiscal 2010 compared to $ 0.3 million during fiscal 2009. these costs were related to the disposal of certain unproductive restaurant assets in connection with our ongoing productivity/efficiency initiatives and facility image enhancement activities . we did not have significant fixed asset disposals during fiscal 2009. interest income . interest income decreased by $ 0.2 million , or 57.5 % , to $ 0.1 million during fiscal 2010 compared to $ 0.3 million during fiscal 2009. this decrease was primarily due to comparatively lower interest rates and investment balances during fiscal 2010. interest expense . interest expense increased by $ 0.01 million , or 15.4 % , to $ 0.09 million during fiscal 2010 compared to $ 0.08 million during fiscal 2009. this increase is primarily due to additional fees paid for our standby letters of credit that support certain of our insurance arrangements during fiscal 2010. loss on investment settlement . loss on investment settlement relates to the settlement agreement reached in december 2009 with our former broker-dealer for the full liquidation of our auction rate securities ( Â“arsÂ” ) investment portfolio . under the terms of the settlement , we received approximately $ 27.4 million in cash ( including accrued interest ) plus the potential for additional recoveries based on the performance of the auction rate securities market over the next three years in exchange for the entire remaining ars investment portfolio . in connection with this settlement , we recorded a pre-tax loss on investment settlement of approximately $ 1.7 million in fiscal 2009. other income , net . net other income increased by $ 0.2 million , or 61.5 % , to $ 0.6 million during fiscal 2010 compared to $

This growth was driven by approximately $62 million from new restaurants not yet in the comparable sales base, a $31.1 million (6.6%) increase in comparable restaurant sales, and $13.9 million from an additional week of sales. Comparable sales growth was attributed to a 3.0% effective menu price increase, a 2.2% rise in guest traffic, and a 1.4% favorable menu mix. Labor and benefit costs rose by $29.1 million (19.5%) to $178.2 million, while occupancy and operating expenses increased by $17.4 million (18.8%) to $109.6 million. General and administrative expenses grew by $5.1 million (17.5%) to $34.6 million. Depreciation and amortization rose by $4.8 million (19.7%) to $28.9 million. Restaurant opening expenses decreased slightly by $0.1 million (2.6%) to $5.2 million, with 10 new restaurants opened in both fiscal years. The company anticipates that most revenue growth in fiscal 2012 will come from new restaurant openings, as existing locations are near full capacity during peak times. The impact of inflation on commodity and labor costs is also noted, alongside the challenges of initial inefficiencies in new market openings."

cash used in 2015 , due primarily to net borrowings on our notes payable to fund working capital and capital investments , offset partially by the 20 cent per share increase in annual dividends . 2015 vs. 2014 - cash used in financing activities increased for 2015 , compared with 2014 , due primarily to an increase in the quarterly dividend rate of two cents , an additional quarter of dividends paid in 2015 , a decrease in our outstanding notes payable , and purchases of treasury stock . environmental , safety and regulatory matters environmental matters - we are subject to multiple historical , wildlife preservation and environmental laws and or regulations that affect many aspects of our present and future operations . regulated activities include , but are not limited to , those involving air emissions , storm water and wastewater discharges , handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes , wetland preservation , hazardous materials transportation , and pipeline and facility construction . these laws and regulations require us to obtain and or comply with a wide variety of environmental clearances , registrations , licenses , permits and other approvals . failure to comply with these laws , regulations , licenses and permits may expose us to fines , penalties and or interruptions in our operations that could be material to our results of operations . in addition , emission controls and or other regulatory or permitting mandates under the clean air act and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures . we can not assure that existing environmental statutes and regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us . revised or additional statutes or regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition , results of operations and cash flows . we own or retain legal responsibility for the environmental conditions at 12 former manufactured natural gas sites in kansas . these sites contain potentially harmful materials that are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations . a consent agreement with the kdhe governs all work at these sites . the terms of the consent agreement require us to investigate these sites and set remediation activities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis . remediation typically involves the management of contaminated soils and may involve removal of structures and monitoring and or remediation of groundwater . we have completed or addressed removal of the source of soil contamination at 11 of the 12 sites , and continue to monitor groundwater at eight of the 12 sites according to plans approved by the kdhe . regulatory closure has been achieved at three of the sites , subject to any future regulatory remediation requirements that may require additional costs . during 2016 , we completed a site assessment at the twelfth site where no active soil remediation has occurred . we have submitted a work plan to the kdhe for approval to remove contaminated soil at this site . costs associated with the remediation at this site are not expected to be material to our results of operations or financial position . with regard to one of our former manufactured natural gas sites , recent results from periodic monitoring and a 2016 interim site investigation indicated elevated levels of potentially harmful materials at the site . in response to the results of the interim site investigation , during the fourth quarter of 2016 , potential investigation and remediation alternatives were developed . we have estimated the potential costs associated with additional investigation and remediation to be in the range of $ 4.0 million to $ 7.0 million . additional testing and work plan development will be conducted in 2017 to develop a remediation work plan to present to the kdhe for approval and could impact our estimates of the cost of remediation at this site . a single reliable estimate of the remediation costs is not feasible due to the amount of uncertainty in the ultimate remediation approach that will be utilized . accordingly , in the fourth quarter of 2016 , we recorded a reserve of $ 4.0 million for this site . our expenditures for environmental evaluation , mitigation , remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial position , results of operations or cash flows , and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effects on earnings or cash flows during 2016 , 2015 and 2014. a number of environmental issues may exist with 36 respect to manufactured gas plants that are unknown to us . accordingly , future costs are dependent on the final determination and regulatory approval of any remedial actions , the complexity of the site , level of remediation required , changing technology and governmental regulations , and to the extent not recovered by insurance or recoverable in rates from our customers , could be material to our financial condition , results of operations or cash flows . with the trend toward stricter standards , greater regulation and more extensive permit requirements for the types of assets operated by us that are subject to environmental regulation , our environmental expenditures could increase in the future , and such expenditures may not be fully recovered by insurance or recoverable in rates from our customers , and those costs may adversely affect our financial condition , results of operations and cash flows . we do not expect expenditures for these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition , results of operations or cash flows . pipeline safety - we are subject to phmsa regulations , including integrity-management regulations . phmsa regulations require pipeline companies operating high-pressure
","In January 2016, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) approved a settlement allowing Oklahoma Natural Gas to increase revenue by $29.995 million, with a regulatory asset of $2.4 million to recover IT costs over four years. The authorized return on equity was set at 9.5%, with a rate base of approximately $1.2 billion. The next Performance-Based Rate Change (PBRC) filing is expected by March 15, 2017. In Kansas, Kansas Gas Service requested a $28 million base rate increase in May 2016, leading to a total increase of $35.4 million after accounting for $7.4 million already being recovered. A settlement in October 2016 resulted in a net increase of $15.5 million, effective January 1, 2017. Texas Gas Service filed for an $11.6 million increase in June 2016, settling for $6.8 million in October 2016, with new rates effective in November 2016. Environmental regulations require compliance with various laws, and the company is responsible for 12 former manufactured gas sites in Kansas, with remediation costs estimated between $4 million and $7 million for one site. Overall, cash provided by financing activities increased in 2016 due to net borrowings, despite a 20-cent per share dividend increase. Environmental expenditures have not significantly impacted financial results in recent years, but future costs may arise from stricter regulations."

consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments : â€œ amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property â€ and â€œ acquisition and integration costs â€ represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets , as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company 's acquisition activities , respectively . â€œ gain on sale of securities â€ represents a non-operating gain on the sale of securities associated with our retirement plan obligations . 35 â€œ tax act items â€ represent a u.s. federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries , foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes with respect to the earnings deemed repatriated for u.s. tax purposes , and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the company 's net u.s. federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the recording of the impact from the tax act , which was enacted into law on december 22 , 2017 . â€œ net new business â€ refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses . the following definitions describe the company 's revenues : fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity . in addition , the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues . while event-driven activity is highly repeatable , it may not recur on an annual basis . the types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are : mutual fund proxy : the proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors , sub-advisors , fee structures , investment restrictions , and mergers of funds . mutual fund communications : mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers . in addition , mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters . proxy contests and specials , corporate actions , and other : the proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests , mergers and acquisitions , and tender/exchange offers . event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process . event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements , resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues . as such , the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast . during the three months ended december 31 , 2018 , we were initially able to separate certain annually recurring mutual fund related communications that were previously included in event-driven fee revenues . these activities were presented within recurring fee revenues commencing in the three months ended december 31 , 2018. we were not able to reliably estimate the portion of event-driven fee revenues attributable to these activities in prior periods . we added approximately $ 12 million to recurring fee revenues for the year ended june 30 , 2019 , and is captured within recurring fee revenues internal growth . generally , mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity . during fiscal year 2019 , mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 14 % lower than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal year 2018 mutual fund proxy revenues were 28 % higher than the prior fiscal year . although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity , we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future . distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials , interim communications , transaction reporting , customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services . distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment , as well as matrix administrative services expenses . these costs are reflected in cost of revenues . closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period . closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity . we consider contract terms , expected client volumes or activity , knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients , among other factors , when determining the estimate . management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs , as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation . closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap . closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance . 36 the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales . larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues , particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment . for fiscal years ended june 30 ,

of additional financing , the successful development of the company 's contemplated plan of operations , or its attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the company to continue operations . the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the company 's ability to continue as a going concern . the consolidated financial statements of the company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties . revenue recognition revenues consist primarily of the sale of our gps tracking devices and the related

","In fiscal 2016, general and administrative costs rose by $44,308, or 19%, compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to expenses related to the launch and marketing of GPS and BLE smartsoles, which increased website development and travel costs. Other expense/income net changed dramatically by 3,070%, or $307,634, largely due to a $794,795 increase in amortization of debt discount, $49,341 in interest expense, and a $146,955 loss on debt extinguishment, offset by a $690,028 increase in derivative income. The net derivative income, resulting from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities, was $703,518. The net loss for fiscal 2016 decreased by approximately 5%, or $59,352, attributed to $270,826 in consulting fees from Inventergy and a $233,417 reduction in professional fees, despite a $307,634 rise in other expenses. As of December 31, 2016, the company reported accumulated losses of $19,739,419 and negative working capital of $1,233,909, with $867,812 owed to accredited investors for convertible promissory notes. The company has incurred net losses of $1,220,356 and $1,279,708 for the years ending December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively, raising substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern without generating profitable operations or obtaining necessary financing. Revenue recognition is primarily from sales of GPS tracking devices, smartsoles, and mobile applications, with revenue recognized upon shipment and transfer of title, while monthly service fees are recognized over the agreement terms."
68,"typically , the apw group acquires the rental stream by way of a purchase of a real property interest in the land underlying the wireless tower or antennae , most commonly easements , usufructs , leasehold and sub-leasehold interests , or fee simple interests , each of which provides the apw group the right to receive the rents from the tenant lease . in addition , the apw group purchases contractual interests , such as an assignment of rents , either in 38 conjunction with the property interest or as a stand-alone right . as of december 31 , 2020 and 2019 , we had interests in 7,189 and 6,046 leases that generate rents for us , respectively . these leases related to properties that were situated on 5 , 427 and 4,586 different communications sites , respectively , throughout the united states and 18 other countries . as of december 31 , 2020 , annualized in-place rents were approximately $ 84 .1 million , whereas r evenue was $ 6 2 . 9 million and $ 6.8 million for the successor period from february 10 to december 31 , 2020 and the predecessor period from january 1 to february 9 , 2020 , respectively . for a definition of annualized in-place rents and a comparison to revenue , the most directly comparable financial measure recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ( â€œ gaap â€ ) , see â€œ â€”non-gaap financial measures â€ below . the apw group 's primary objectives are to continuously acquire , aggregate and hold underlying real property interests and revenue streams critical for wireless communications . the apw group purchases the right to receive future rental payments generated pursuant to an existing tenant lease between a property owner and an owner of a wireless tower or antennae either through an up-front payment or on an installment basis from landowners who have leased their property to companies that own telecommunications infrastructure assets . the real property interests ( other than fee simple interests which are perpetual ) typically have stated terms of 30 to 99 years , although some are shorter , and provide the apw group with the right to receive the future income from the future tenant lease rental payments over a specified duration . in most cases , the stated term of the real property interest is longer than the remaining term of the tenant lease , which provides the apw group with the right and opportunity for renewals and extensions . in addition to real property rights , the apw group acquires contractual rights by way of an assignment of rents . the rent assignment is a contractual obligation pursuant to which the property owner assigns its right to receive all communications rents relating to the property , including rents arising under the tenant lease , to the apw group . a rent assignment relates only to an existing tenant lease and therefore would not provide the apw group the ability automatically to benefit from lease renewals beyond those provided for in the existing tenant lease . however , in these cases , the apw group either limits the purchase price of the asset to the term of the current tenant lease or obtains the ability to negotiate future leases and a contractual obligation from the property owner to assign rental streams from future tenant lease renewals . the apw group 's primary long-term objective is to continue to grow its business organically , through annual rent escalators , the addition of new tenants and or lease modifications , and acquisitively , as it has done in recent years , and fully take advantage of the established asset management platform it has created . apw acquisition transactions apw acquisition on november 19 , 2019 , we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to acquire ap wireless and its subsidiaries from associated partners , l.p. ( â€œ associated partners â€ ) . upon completion of the apw acquisition on the closing date , we acquired a 91.8 % interest in apw opco llc ( â€œ apw opco â€ ) , the parent of ap wireless and the indirect parent of the apw group , for consideration of approximately $ 860 million less ( i ) debt as of june 30 , 2019 of approximately $ 539 million , ( ii ) approximately $ 65 million to redeem a minority investor in the ap wireless business and ( iii ) allocable transaction expenses of approximately $ 10.7 million plus ( iv ) cash as of june 30 , 2019 of approximately $ 66.5 million ( subject to certain limited adjustments ) . the acquisition was completed through a merger of one of landscape 's subsidiaries with and into apw opco , with apw opco surviving such merger as a majority owned subsidiary of ours . following the apw acquisition , we own 91.8 % of apw opco , with certain former partners of associated partners who were members of apw opco immediately prior to the closing date and who elected to roll over their investment in apw opco in connection with the apw acquisition ( the â€œ continuing opco members â€ ) owning the remaining 8.2 % interest in apw opco . as a result , the ap wireless business is 100 % owned by radius and the continuing opco members . certain securities of apw opco issued and outstanding upon completion of the apw acquisition are subject to time and performance vesting conditions . in addition , all securities of apw opco held by persons other than the company are exchangeable for class a common shares . story_separator_special_tag management believes the presentation of acquisition capex provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing our financial performance and growth , as it is a comprehensive measure of our investments in the revenue-producing assets that we acquire in a given period . acquisition capex has important limitations as an analytical tool , because it excludes certain fixed and variable costs related to our selling , marketing and underwriting activities included in selling , general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations , including corporate overhead expenses . further , this financial measure may be different from calculations used by other companies and comparability may therefore be limited . you should not consider acquisition capex or any of the other non-gaap measures we utilize as an alternative or substitute for our results . 44 the following is a reconciliation of acquisition capex to the amounts included as an investing cash flow in our consolidated statements of cash flows for investments in real property interests and related intangible assets , the most comparable gaap measure , which generally represents up-front payments made in connection the acquisition of these assets during the period . the primary adjustment to the comparable gaap measure is â€œ committed contractual payments for investments in real property interests and intangible assets â€ , which represents the total amount of future payments that we were contractually committed to make in connection with our acquisitions of real property interests and intangible assets that occurred during the period . additionally , foreign exchange translation adjustments impact the determination of acquisition capex . replace_table_token_12_th annualized in-place rents annualized in-place rents is a non-gaap measure that measures performance based on annualized contractual revenue from the rents expected to be collected on leases owned and acquired ( â€œ in place â€ ) as of the measurement date . annualized in-place rents is calculated using the implied monthly revenue from all revenue producing leases that are in place as of the measurement date multiplied by twelve . implied monthly revenue for each lease is calculated based on the most recent rental payment made under such lease . management believes the presentation of annualized in-place rents provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing our financial performance and growth . in particular , management believes the presentation of annualized in-place rents provides a measurement at the applicable point of time as opposed to revenue , which is recorded in the applicable period on revenue-producing assets in place as they are acquired . annualized in-place rents has important limitations as an analytical tool because it is calculated at a particular moment in time , the measurement date , but implies an annualized amount of contractual revenue . as a result , following the measurement date , among other things , the underlying leases used in calculating the annualized in-place rents financial measure may be terminated , new leases may be acquired , or the contractual rents payable under such leases may not be collected . in these respects , among others , annualized in-place rents differs from â€œ revenue â€ , which is the closest comparable gaap measure and which represents all revenues ( contractual or otherwise ) earned over the applicable period . revenue is recorded as earned over the period in which the lessee is given control over the use of the wireless communication sites and recorded over the term of the lease . you should not consider annualized in-place rents or any of the other non-gaap measures we utilize as an alternative or substitute for our results . the following is a comparison of annualized in-place rents to revenue , the

period from january 1 to february 9 , 2020 , respectively , compared to $ 55.7 million for the predecessor year ended december 31 , 2019. the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the

","As of December 31, 2020, the APW Group held interests in 7,189 leases generating annualized in-place rents of approximately $84.1 million, an increase from 6,046 leases and $55.7 million in 2019. These leases were located on 5,427 communications sites across the U.S. and 18 other countries. The group's revenue for the successor period (February 10 to December 31, 2020) was $62.9 million, compared to $6.8 million for the predecessor period (January 1 to February 9, 2020). The increase in revenue was attributed to a 19% rise in the number of leases acquired. The cost of service rose to $619,000 in the successor period from $34,000 in the predecessor period, driven by recurring expenses from fee simple interests.  The APW Group primarily acquires real property interests, such as easements and leasehold interests, to secure future rental payments from wireless communications infrastructure. In November 2019, the group announced the acquisition of AP Wireless for approximately $860 million, resulting in a 91.8% ownership stake in APW Opco LLC. The acquisition was financed by deducting $539 million in debt, $65 million to redeem a minority investor, and $10.7 million in transaction expenses, while including $66.5 million in cash. The APW Group aims to grow its business through organic means, such as annual rent escalators and new tenant additions, as well as through acquisitions."

billion in fiscal 2017 , and 6,719 contracts with an aggregate value of $ 5.65 billion in fiscal 2016 . although we experienced strong order growth in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 , in our fourth quarter , we experienced a moderation in demand as compared to the prior year . in the three months ended october 31 , 2018 , the value and number of contracts signed declined 15 % and 13 % , respectively , as compared to the three months ended october 31 , 2017. in november through mid-december 2018 , we experienced further softening in demand . we believe this decline in demand is due to the cumulative impact of rising interest rates , increased prices , and a shift in buyer sentiment . according to the u.s. census bureau ( â€œ census bureau â€ ) , the number of households earning $

million new households per year from 2017 to 2027. housing starts , which encompass the units needed for household formations , second homes , and the replacement of obsolete or demolished units , have not kept pace with this projected household growth or the aging of existing homes . according to the census bureau 's october 2018 new residential sales report , new home inventory stands at a supply of just 7.4 months , based on current sales paces . if demand increases significantly , the supply of 7.4 months will quickly be drawn down . during the period 1970 through 2007 , total housing starts in the united states averaged approximately 1.6 million per year , while during the period 2008 through 2017 , total housing starts averaged approximately 0.89 million per year according to the census bureau . additionally , the median age of housing stock in the united states has increased from 25 years to 40 years over the last three decades , thus expanding the market for replacement

whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized . we file tax returns in the various states in which we do business . each state has its own statutes regarding the use of tax loss carryforwards . some of the states in which we do business do not allow for the carryforward of losses , while others allow for carryforwards for five years to 20 years . for state tax purposes , we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions where it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset would not be realized . due to past and projected losses in certain jurisdictions where we did not have carryback potential

The value of net contracts signed in 2018 was $7.60 billion (8,519 homes), compared to $6.83 billion (8,175 homes) in 2017. The backlog as of October 31, 2018, was $5.52 billion (6,105 homes), an increase from $5.06 billion (5,851 homes) the previous year. The company had $1.18 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.13 billion available under a $1.295 billion revolving credit facility, with no outstanding borrowings. Quarterly cash dividends were initiated in February 2017, with $0.41 per share paid in 2018 and $0.24 in 2017. The company acquired assets from Coleman in November 2016 for approximately $83.1 million, including 1,750 home sites and contracts for 128 homes valued at $38.8 million. Despite strong order growth in early 2018, demand softened in the fourth quarter, attributed to rising interest rates and increased prices. The U.S. Census Bureau reported 37.3 million households earning $100,000 or more as of September 2018, representing 29.2% of all U.S. households. Housing starts have averaged 0.89 million per year from 2008 to 2017, significantly lower than the 1.6 million average from 1970 to 2007, leading to a median housing stock age increase from 25 to 40 years. The company believes its communities are in desirable locations with substantial embedded value. Changes in tax laws have also impacted financial results, with a $35.5 million income tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 due to the tax act. The company assesses deferred tax assets based on realizability, with no new valuation allowances recorded in 2018 and 2017. Revenue from home sales is recognized upon delivery, with costs amortized based on the number of homes constructed. The company adopted new revenue recognition standards on November 1, 2018, which may affect future financial reporting."
70,"operating costs consist primarily of crew costs , repair and maintenance costs , insurance costs , fuel , lube oil and supplies costs and other vessel operating costs . fleet size , fleet composition , geographic areas of operation , supply and demand for marine personnel , and local labor requirements are the major factors which affect overall crew costs in all segments . in addition , our newer , more technologically sophisticated vessels generally require a greater number of specially trained , more highly compensated fleet personnel than our older , smaller and less sophisticated vessels . crew costs may increase if competition for skilled personnel intensifies , although a weaker offshore energy market could mitigate any potential inflation of crew costs . 32 costs related to the recertification of vessels are deferred and amortized over 30 months on a straight-line basis . maintenance costs incurred at the time of the recertification drydocking that are not related to the recertification of the vessel are expensed as incurred . costs related to vessel improvements that either extend the vessel 's useful life or increase the vessel 's functionality are capitalized and depreciated . insurance costs are dependent on a variety of factors , including our safety record and pricing in the insurance markets , and can fluctuate over time . our vessels are generally insured for up to their estimated fair market value in order to cover damage or loss resulting from marine casualties , adverse weather conditions , mechanical failure , collisions , and property losses to the vessel . we also purchase coverage for potential liabilities stemming from third-party losses with limits that we believe are reasonable for our operations , but do not generally purchase business interruption insurance or similar coverage . insurance limits are reviewed annually , and third-party coverage is purchased based on the expected scope of ongoing operations and the cost of third-party coverage . fuel and lube costs can also fluctuate in any given period depending on the number and distance of vessel mobilizations , the number of active vessels off charter , drydockings , and changes in fuel prices . we also incur vessel operating costs that are aggregated as â€œ other â€ vessel operating costs . these costs consist of brokers ' commissions , including commissions paid to unconsolidated joint venture companies , training costs , satellite communication fees , agent fees , port fees and other miscellaneous costs . brokers ' commissions are incurred primarily in our non-u.s. operating areas where brokers oftentimes assist us in obtaining work . brokers generally are paid a percentage of day rates billed upon collection of the amounts invoiced and , accordingly , commissions paid to brokers generally fluctuate in accordance with vessel revenue . deepwater activity is a significant segment of the global offshore crude oil and natural gas markets , and a significant component of our business . development typically involves significant capital investment and multi-year development plans . such projects are generally underwritten by the participating exploration , field development and production companies using relatively conservative crude oil and natural gas pricing assumptions . although these projects are generally less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas , deepwater exploration and development projects can be more costly relative to other onshore and offshore exploration and development . as a result , generally depressed crude oil prices have caused , and may continue to cause , many of our customers and potential customers to reevaluate their future capital expenditures in regard to deepwater projects . sonatide we previously disclosed the significant financial and operational challenges that we confront with respect to operations in angola , as well as steps that we have taken to address or mitigate those risks . most of our attention has been focused in three areas : ( i ) reducing the net receivable balance due from sonatide , our angolan joint venture with sonangol , for vessel services ; ( ii ) reducing the foreign currency risk created by virtue of provisions of angolan law that require that payment for a portion of the services provided by sonatide be paid in angolan kwanza ; and ( iii ) optimizing opportunities , consistent with angolan law , for services provided by us to be paid for directly in u.s. dollars . in late 2019 , we were informed that , as part of a broad privatization program , sonangol intends to seek to divest itself from sonatide . in the second quarter of 2020 , sonatide declared a $ 35.0 million dividend . on june 22 , 2020 , sonangol received $ 17.8 million and we received $ 17.2 million . our share of the dividend is reflected as dividend income from unconsolidated company in the consolidated statement of operations because ( i ) our investment in sonatide had previously been written down to zero , ( ii ) the distributions are not refundable and ( iii ) we are not liable for the obligations of or committed to provide financial support to sonatide . in addition , as a result of the aforementioned dividend payment , the cash balances of the joint venture were significantly reduced and we determined that , as a result , a significant portion of our net due from sonatide balance was compromised . during the year ended december 31 , 2020 , we recorded a $ 40.9 million affiliate credit loss impairment expense . dtdw we own 40 % of dtdw in nigeria . our partner , who owns 60 % , is a nigerian national . dtdw owns one offshore service vessel and has long term debt of $ 4.7 million which is secured by the vessel and guarantees from the dtdw partners . we also operate company owned vessels in nigeria for which the joint venture receives a commission . story_separator_special_tag our middle east/asia pacific segment was only marginally affected by covid-19 . operating loss for the middle east/asia pacific segment was approximately flat compared with the prior year because increased revenue was offset by higher vessel operating costs and an increase in depreciation resulting from increased amortization of deferred drydock costs . europe/mediterranean segment operations . vessel revenues in the europe/mediterranean segment decreased 32.4 % , or $ 40.1 million , during the year ended december 31 , 2020 , as compared to the year ended december 31 , 2019 primarily due to a 13 active vessel decrease . europe/mediterranean segment active utilization increased from 85.8 % to 89.8 % and average day rates increased by 5.4 % . these increases in average day rates are due to the mix of vessels under longer term higher day rate contracts continuing while shorter term and spot contracts were delayed or canceled . this segment experienced a significant downturn due to the pandemic . operating loss for the europe/mediterranean segment increased from $ 1.3 million for the year ended december 31 , 2019 to $ 8.6 million in 2020 for the year ended december 31 , 2020. this decrease resulted from lower revenue , which more than offset lower operating costs associated with lower vessel activity and lower general and administrative costs attributable to our ongoing cost reduction efforts . west africa segment operations . vessel revenues in the west africa segment decreased 37.5 % , or $ 47.3 million , during the year ended december 31 , 2020 , as compared to the year ended december 31 , 2019. the west africa active vessel fleet decreased by 14 vessels during the comparative periods . west africa segment active utilization decreased from 75.1 % to 62.8 % and average day rates increased by 3.2 % . the decreases in revenue were mainly due to the capacity reduction and utilization decline caused by the negative impact of the pandemic . this segment had the most negative impact from the pandemic because of significant contract cancellations the operating loss for the west africa segment was $ 27.5 million for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , as compared to $ 8.3 million operating profit for the year ended december 31 , 2019 primarily resulting from decreased revenue and $ 6.6 million of increased depreciation and amortization resulting from higher amortization of drydock costs . these declines were partially offset by lower operating costs associated with the lower vessel activity and lower general and administrative costs attributable to our ongoing cost reduction efforts . 38 vessel utilization and average rates by segment replace_table_token_8_th owned or chartered vessels include stacked vessels . we consider a vessel to be stacked if the vessel crew is furloughed or substantially reduced and limited maintenance is being performed on the vessel . we reduce operating costs by stacking vessels when management does not foresee opportunities to profitably or strategically operate the vessels in the near future . vessels are stacked when market conditions warrant and they are no longer considered stacked when they are returned to active service , sold or otherwise disposed . when economically practical marketing opportunities arise , the stacked vessels can be returned to active service by performing any necessary maintenance on the vessel and either rehiring or returning fleet personnel to operate the vessel . although not currently fulfilling charters , stacked vessels are considered to be in service and are included in the calculation of our utilization statistics . we had 35 and 19 stacked vessels in our active fleet as of december 31 , 2020 and december 31 , 2019 , respectively . as of december 31 , 2019 , we had 46 total vessels that were classified as assets held for sale . during 2020 , we designated an additional 32 assets for disposition and sold 53 vessels that had been designated as held for sale plus an additional three vessels from our active fleet . at december 31 , 2020 , 23 vessels remain reclassified as assets held for sale in current assets . 39 vessel dispositions we seek opportunities to sell and or recycle our older vessels when market conditions warrant and opportunities arise . the majority of our vessels are sold to buyers who do not compete with us in the offshore energy industry . the number of vessels disposed by segment are as follows : replace_table_token_9_th vessel deliveries we did not build any vessels in the two years ended december 31 , 2020. in the fourth quarter of 2020 , we acquired 11 crew boats for $ 5.3 million which were added to our active fleet in africa . general and

certain executive officers and other corporate employees . general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 , 2020 have decreased as compared to the comparable prior year primarily as a result of our continuing efforts to reduce overhead costs due to the downturn in the offshore services market . liquidity , capital resources and other matters availability of cash as of december

","Operating costs for the company primarily include crew costs, repair and maintenance, insurance, fuel, lube oil, and other vessel operating expenses. Key factors influencing crew costs are fleet size, composition, geographic operations, and local labor requirements. Newer vessels necessitate more specialized personnel, potentially increasing crew costs, although a weaker offshore energy market may counteract this. Vessel recertification costs are amortized over 30 months, while maintenance costs during drydocking are expensed immediately. Insurance costs vary based on safety records and market conditions, with vessels insured for their fair market value. Fuel and lube costs fluctuate based on vessel mobilizations and fuel prices. Other operating costs include brokers' commissions, training, and port fees. The deepwater segment, crucial for offshore oil and gas, faces challenges due to depressed crude prices, prompting clients to reassess capital expenditures. The company has faced financial difficulties with its Angolan joint venture, Sonatide, leading to a $40.9 million credit loss in 2020. The Middle East/Asia Pacific segment remained stable, while the Europe/Mediterranean segment saw a 32.4% revenue drop, resulting in an operating loss of $8.6 million. The West Africa segment experienced a 37.5% revenue decline, with an operating loss of $27.5 million, attributed to contract cancellations amid the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, the company had 35 stacked vessels, down from 19 the previous year, and designated 23 vessels as assets held for sale. The company acquired 11 crew boats for $5.3 million in late 2020. General and administrative expenses decreased due to cost-cutting measures, with cash and cash equivalents totaling $155.2 million at year-end."
71,"as of december 31 , 2018 and september 30 , 2018 , the partnership 's assets were allocated among the advisors in the following approximate percentages : replace_table_token_1_th secor capital advisors , lp secor 's investment objectives are to generate high risk-adjusted returns by : ( i ) investing across a diverse set of asset classes , geographies , factors , themes and time horizons , ( ii ) identifying and exploiting temporarily pronounced market inefficiencies or risk premia , ( iii ) employing dynamic risk-budgeting to minimize tail risk and potentially enable alpha to be generated through timing of exposures and ( iv ) utilizing sophisticated modeling techniques supported by straight-forward economic intuition and sound fundamentals . secor will seek to target long-term annualized volatility of 15 % and low long-term correlation to other hedge fund strategies and broader markets . secor has a healthy respect for the general information efficiency of markets but believes that certain inefficiencies ( or outsized risk premia ) may exist in certain markets , and these or other inefficiencies ( or risk premia ) may periodically become more pronounced in particular market conditions . secor believes that it is feasible to construct an investment strategy that seeks to capture such inefficiencies ( premia ) in pursuit of high risk-adjusted returns ( or excess returns for benchmarked mandates ) that are lowly correlated with broad stock and bond market returns ( alpha ) . secor employs statistical techniques and empirical analysis to help determine whether they believe that observed or conjectured alpha opportunities are real and , more importantly , likely to be sustained in the future . if properly employed , these techniques may have certain advantages versus a purely judgmental approach including the potential ability to : control for the impact of particular factors , evaluate phenomena over a longer history , systematically assess confidence levels based on availability of data , evaluate performance over certain sub-periods and market cycles , identify certain possible causation and lead/lag effects , reduce certain common behavioral biases in human judgment and evaluate a range of factors in a systematic way . when determining whether a factor should be used in driving secor 's models and strategies , conclusions derived from the statistical techniques are generally not sufficient . secor also seeks to reconcile whether the findings are consistent with some economic , theoretical or behavioral intuition , including why a factor may lead to alpha and what conditions could cause a factor to cease to work at some point in the future . although the statistical techniques that secor uses to conduct its empirical evaluations may be sophisticated , secor strives to keep the models that drive the investment process as simple as practicable . secor uses its proprietary models to systematically allocate and manage risk across a wide breadth of quantitative investment strategies , geographies and asset classes Â– a process known as risk budgeting . secor employs these models to construct a portfolio and manage risk . these strategies may include currencies , commodities , equity indices , fixed income , cross-asset class trades and opportunistic strategies . secor strongly believes in the benefits of diversification and that diversification should be sought across many aspects of the investment process . under most circumstances , secor will attempt to take positions in a large number of positions across a wide range of asset classes to enhance diversification . secor also seeks diversification across strategies , factors , themes and time horizons . diversification of risk across strategies may help to produce a more consistent stream of returns by reducing the impact of poor performance in any one strategy . recognizing that none of secor 's strategies will work at all times and , in fact , most strategies experience periods of significant negative performance , secor seeks to develop strategies in many asset classes and markets in which secor identifies potential value . 20 within each strategy , it is also important to ensure that there is appropriate diversification across factors and themes and that the weightings of these themes can be controlled and easily changed dynamically as market conditions warrant , while taking into account factors such as liquidity , volatility , correlations , market impact and transaction costs . in portfolio construction , secor 's initial task is to identify , among other things , tilts , premia , signals , relative value pairs , anomalies , liquidity events and temporary price pressure that secor believes may provide attractive risk/return contributions on a stand-alone basis and in the context of a broader portfolio . secor then combines data and general conviction levels ( in the form of priors ) regarding the potential contributions and correlations of these exposures to help determine their allocations within the portfolio , utilizing a thoughtful , systematic risk-budgeting approach that seeks to enable these exposures to be dynamic , rather than static . in doing so , part of secor 's alpha proposition could reside in timing exposures , or identifying the appropriate times to : increase or decrease exposures and or include or exclude exposures from the portfolio altogether . the foregoing is not a comprehensive list of the methods of analysis and or investment strategies that may be employed by secor . secor intends to continually review and refine its strategies and to examine new ideas and opportunities . additional strategies may be added from time to time . the descriptions set forth herein about specific strategies that secor may deploy are not intended to be exhaustive and should not be understood to limit the partnership 's or secor master 's investment activities . harbour

72,"during the periods of 2011 and 2012 there has been close balance of industry capacity and demand for freight services although the demand for freight services has not reached levels of demand that existed during the years immediately preceding 2009. balancing of the industry capacity and demand of freight services has allowed the company to obtain freight rate increases although these increases have not covered the company 's increases in operating costs . competition for drivers , which is always intense , escalated during 2011 due to general improvements in the demand for freight services . the company has experienced increasing difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers . the company continues to explore new ideas and ways to attract and retain qualified drivers . 18 containment of fuel cost continues to be one of management 's top priorities . the company continues to be challenged by increased fuel prices and anticipates that fuel prices will remain at or above current levels . average diesel fuel prices have increased each year over the past year during the periods 2009 through 2012. average department of energy ( `` doe `` ) diesel prices for 2009 through 2012 have been , $ 2.47 , $ 3.00 , $ 3.85 , and $ 3.97 , respectively . most recently the doe price was $ 4.16 . the company continues to manage and implement fuel initiative strategies to effectively manage fuel costs . these initiatives include strategic fueling of our trucks whether it be terminal fuel or over-the-road fuel , reduction of tractor idle time , controlling out-of-route miles , controlling empty miles , trailer skirting , and increased fuel economy through the purchase of newer , more fuel efficient tractors . the company is not able to pass through all fuel price increases through fuel surcharge agreements with customers due to tractor idling time , along with empty and out-of-route miles . the company continues to focus on fuel surcharge pricing , truck idling hours , and fuel purchasing decisions in an effort to lessen the impact of higher fuel costs . at december 31 , 2012 , 100 % of the company 's tractor fleet is equipped with idle management controls . at december 31 , 2012 , the company 's tractor fleet had an average age of 2.4 years and the company 's trailer fleet had an average age of 3.1 years . the average age of tractor equipment is expected to improve throughout 2013 as the company takes delivery of new tractors and the trailer fleet is expected to remain consistent throughout 2013 with the sale of older units . the company continues to focus on growing internally by providing quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in the company 's regional operating areas . in addition to the development of its regional operating centers , the company has made five acquisitions since 1987. we believe our commitment to quality service allowed the company to hold its freight rates relatively stable throughout the recent recession , in comparison to our competitors , better positioning the company for future growth as market capacity continues to tighten . future growth is dependent upon several factors including the level of economic growth and the related customer demand , the available capacity in the trucking industry , potential acquisition opportunities , and the availability and ability to attract and retain experienced drivers that meet our hiring standards . the company hires only experienced drivers ( minimum 1 year of driving experience ) with safe driving records . in order to attract and retain experienced drivers who understand the importance of customer service , the company has sought to solidify its position as an industry leader in driver compensation in the company 's operating markets . the company offers the top or near the top compensation pay per mile to drivers in the markets in which the company operates as well as safety pay incentives . the company became publicly traded in november , 1986 and is traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol htld . the company was awarded logistics management magazine quest for quality award in 2012 for the tenth straight year , bp lubricants usa safe driving award for the past five consecutive years , as well as being named fleet owners magazine 's 2011 fleet of the year . the company also received the u.s. environmental protection agency ( `` epa `` ) smartwayÂ® excellence award for 2012 for company 's ongoing fuel conservation efforts . during the past four years the company has received sixty nine customer service awards and industry recognitions . the company has paid cash dividends over the past thirty-eight consecutive quarters , including special dividends of $ 196.5 million in may of 2007 , $ 90.7 million in october of 2010 , and $ 85.0 million in december 2012. in addition the company has paid approximately $ 162.3 million to repurchase 12.2 million shares through stock repurchases over the past five years . the company ended the year of 2012 with operating revenues of $ 545.7 million , including fuel surcharges , net income of $ 61.5 million , and basic net income per share of $ 0.72 on basic weighted average outstanding shares of 85.9 million compared to operating revenues of $ 528.6 million , including fuel surcharges , net income of $ 69.9 million , and basic net income per share of $ 0.78 on basic weighted average shares of 89.7 million in 2011. the company posted an 82.6 % operating ratio ( operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues ) for the year ended december 31 , 2012 compared to 79.8 % for the same period of 2011 and a 11.3 % net margin ( net income as a percentage of operating revenues ) for 2012 compared to 13.2 % in same period of 2011. the company had total assets of $ 467.7 million at december 31 story_separator_special_tag the company intends to use strong pricing of used equipment as an opportunity to continue to upgrade its trailer fleet in 2012 but to a lesser extent than it did in 2011. interest income decreased $ 0.7 million ( 45.7 % ) , to $ 0.8 million in the year ended december 31 , 2011from $ 1.4 million in the 2010 period . the decrease is mainly the result of lower average portfolio returns due to the continued historical lows of short-term interest rates . the decrease in the company 's overall return was largely attributable to a larger mix of cash and cash equivalents 22 on average held throughout the year compared to the prior year due to calls of long-term auction rate security investments tied to longer term interest rates being converted to cash and cash equivalents upon receipt of calls of auction rate securities . the company 's effective tax rate was 34.8 % and 33.0 % for year ended december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the increase in the effective tax rate for 2011 is primarily attributable to a decrease in favorable income tax expense adjustments during the 2011 period compared to the same period of 2010 resulting from the roll off of certain state tax contingencies coupled with more taxable income during the current year compared to the same period of 2010. as a result of the foregoing , the company 's operating ratio ( operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue ) was 79.8 % during the year ended december 31 , 2011 compared with 81.7 % during the year ended december 31 , 2010. net income increased $ 7.7 million ( 12.4 % ) , to $ 69.9 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 from $ 62.2 million during the compared 2010 period as a result of the net effects discussed above . inflation and fuel cost most of the company 's operating expenses are inflation-sensitive , with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations . during the past three years , inflation has been fairly modest with its impacts mostly related to revenue equipment prices , tire prices and the compensation paid to drivers . innovations in equipment technology , epa mandated new engine emission requirements on tractor engines manufactured after january 1 , 2007 and january 1 , 2010 , and driver comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices . the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts . tractors currently being purchased with engines meeting january 1 , 2010 epa requirements are approximately 21 % more expensive than tractors that were purchased with engines meeting january 1 , 2007 epa requirements . tractors previously acquired with engines meeting january 1 , 2007 epa requirements were approximately 37 % more expensive than tractors that were purchased with engines meeting january 1 , 2002 epa requirements . general improvement of economic conditions and balancing of industry supply and the demand for freight services in 2010 and 2011 have allowed certain rate increases mainly in 2011 and 2012 , although the rate increases received have significantly lagged the increased prices paid for new revenue equipment over the same period . in addition to inflation , fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability . most of the company 's contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions . although the company historically has been able to pass through most long-term increases in fuel prices and operating taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates , shorter-term increases are not fully recovered . average doe fuel prices during 2008 through 2012 are summarized below . replace_table_token_7_th fuel expense , net of fuel surcharge revenue and fuel stabilization paid to independent contractors along with favorable fuel hedge settlements in 2009 , was 16.4 % , 16.1 % , 15.3 % , and 15.1 % for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 , respectively , of the company 's total operating expenses , net of fuel surcharge revenue and gains on sale of equipment . significant fluctuations in fuel prices increase our cost of operations as the company is unable to pass through all increases in fuel prices . the company is not able to recover fuel surcharge on empty miles , out of route miles , or fuel used in idling so as there are significant changes in fuel prices the company 's operating results could be adversely effected .

","Between 2011 and 2012, the freight services industry maintained a balance between capacity and demand, although demand levels remained below those seen before 2009. This balance allowed the company to implement freight rate increases, which, however, did not fully offset rising operating costs. The competition for qualified drivers intensified in 2011, complicating recruitment and retention efforts. Fuel cost management remained a priority, with average diesel prices rising from $2.47 in 2009 to $4.16 by the end of 2012. The company adopted various fuel-saving strategies, including idle management and purchasing more fuel-efficient tractors, with 100% of its fleet equipped with idle management controls by December 31, 2012. The average age of the tractor fleet was 2.4 years, while the trailer fleet averaged 3.1 years. In 2012, the company reported operating revenues of $545.7 million and a net income of $61.5 million, resulting in a basic net income per share of $0.72. The operating ratio was 82.6%, indicating a rise from 79.8% in 2011, while the net margin decreased from 13.2% to 11.3%. The company has consistently paid dividends for 38 consecutive quarters and has received numerous industry awards, including the Logistics Management Magazine's Quest for Quality Award for ten consecutive years.

accounted for approximately 79 % of total revenues , in comparison to fiscal 2016 , in which smartsole and related sales accounted for approximately 62 % of total revenues . the company 's goal is to generate recurring subscription revenues from the use of all of our tracking products , including the smartsoles product . the balance of the revenue for fiscal year 2017 is represented by the sales of our new military products , stand-alone units , consulting and ip licensing . 25 cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased 39 % or $ 136,634 during fiscal 2017 in comparison to fiscal 2016 primarily due to efficiencies in buying and manufacturing costs related to the sales of the smartsole . as a result , total gross margin , excluding the inventergy payments , increased from 20 % in fiscal 2016 to 50 % in fiscal 2017. as we increase our subscription base of monthly recurring fees , total overall gross margins are expected to increase accordingly . wages and benefits wages and benefits for fiscal 2017 increased $ 74,506 or 13 % compared to fiscal 2016. the increase is a direct result of a growing subscriber base , new product development , and the military contract we received in the fourth quarter of 2017 , all of which required an increase in personnel . in addition , due to a growing economy and overall rising wages , we needed to increase the salaries of our entire engineering staff in order to stay competitive in the market place and maintain employee retention , which was critical to the manufacturing of our military products . professional fees professional fees consist of costs attributable to consultants and contractors who primarily spend their time on legal , accounting , product development , business development , corporate advisory services and investor relations . such costs decreased $ 155,143 or 35 % in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 , as noted above , we increased in-house wages but decreased professional fees . part of the reduction was attributed to allocating more responsibilities from outside contractors and consultants to in-house personnel . sale and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased by 100 % or $ 44,446 during 2017 in comparison to 2016 , which reflects the initiation of online advertising utilizing social media and google ads . this was the first time the company began direct advertising in order to increase online traffic and retail sales . research and development expenses in 2017 increased our research and development expenses 1,257 % as we incurred non-recurring r & d expenses of $ 49,126 related to the development of our verizon , military , children 's and bio metric product lines , as compared to $ 3,619 in 2016. with all new products there are initial capital expenses in order to develop porotypes and bring the product to light . as products transitions into production the r & d surrounding those products typically reduces over time . general and administrative general and administrative costs during fiscal 2017 increased by $ 70,794 or 26 % in comparison to fiscal 2016 due to the costs related to the launch , marketing and market development associated with our military , children 's smartsoles and new biometric insoles , which increased supplies , equipment , website development and related marketing and sales expenses . other expense/income , net other expense/income , net decreased by 21 % , or $ 62,670 , from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 primarily as a net result of decreased amortization of debt discount . the accounting treatment for the bifurcation of the derivative liabilities embedded in our short-term convertible notes results in a net derivative , non-cash income of $ 309,142. the derivative loss represents the change in fair value of the derivative liability during the period . story_separator_special_tag net loss net loss during fiscal 2017 increased by $ 45,988 , or 4 % , in comparison to the net loss incurred during fiscal 2016. however , if we adjust for one-time non-recurring research and development and new product launch expenses , we would have realized a 4 % decrease in overall net losses .

see the section entitled â€œ risk factors â€ for more information regarding risks associated with our business . contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december 31 , 2017 : replace_table_token_4_th off-balance sheet arrangements there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition , changes in financial condition , revenues or expenses , results of operations , liquidity , capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors . inflation inflation and changing prices have had no effect on our net sales and revenues or on our income from continuing operations over our two most recent fiscal years . critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states . because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events , the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment . the financial statements have , in management 's opinion , been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below . we have identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management 's most difficult , subjective or complex judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain . the following is a review of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by us : going concern the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future . the company has incurred net losses of $ 1,266,344 and $ 1,220,356 for the years ended december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $ 21,005,763 as of december 31 , 2017 , and has negative working capital of $ 1,675,414 as of december 31 , 2017. a significant part of our negative working capital position at december 31 , 2017 consisted of $ 981,758 of amounts due to various accredited investors of the company for convertible promissory notes . the company anticipates further losses in the development of its business . 28 the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future and or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due . the company 's ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of debt or equity is unknown . the obtainment of additional financing , the successful development of the company 's contemplated plan of operations , or its attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the company to continue operations . the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the company 's ability to continue as a going concern . the consolidated financial statements of the company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties . revenue recognition revenues consist primarily of the sale of our gps tracking devices and the related monthly service fees , the sale of our gps smartsole , the monthly service fee from subscribers of the gps smartsole , and our mobile tracking applications sold via the apple itunes store and the google marketplace . the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the product is shipped to the customer and title has transferred . the company recognizes application revenue when the application is purchased by the customer . the company assumes no remaining significant obligations associated with the product sale other than that related to its warranty program discussed below . revenue related to monthly service fees both for the gps and ble smartsole , gps tracking devices , alert tag , licensing agreements and annual subscriptions are recognized over the respective terms of the agreements . revenue from multiple-element arrangements is allocated to the elements based on the relative fair value of each element , which is generally based on the relative sales price of each element when sold separately . each element 's allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met . if the company can not objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element arrangement , the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed , or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements . product warranty the company 's warranty policy provides repair or replacement of products ( excluding gps shoe devices ) returned for defects within ninety days of purchase . warranty liabilities are recorded at the time of sale for the estimated costs that may be incurred under our standard warranty . as of december 31 , 2017 , products returned for repair or replacement have been immaterial . accordingly , a warranty liability has not been deemed necessary . derivative instruments our debt or equity instruments may contain embedded derivative instruments

74,"we are sensitive to the risks facing the retail industry as a result of the growth of e-commerce . we are addressing our exposure to the retail industry by seeking to acquire industrial properties that we believe capitalize on e-commerce activities , such as e-commerce distribution and warehousing facilities , and by being especially selective in acquiring retail properties . as a result , retail properties generated 41.9 % , 43.3 % , and 46.1 % of rental income , net , in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively , and industrial properties generated 39.1 % , 34.1 % , and 30.8 % of rental income , net , in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively . 2018 highlights in 2018 : our rental income , net , increased by $ 2.1 million , or 3.1 % , from 2017. we acquired eight industrial properties for an aggregate purchase price of $ 79.5 million . the acquired properties account for $ 5.6 million , or 8.1 % , of our 2019 contractual rental income . 32 we sold three properties for a net gain on sale of real estate of $ 5.3 million . the properties sold accounted for 3.0 % and 4.7 % of 2018 and 2017 rental income net , respectively . unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have 50 % equity interest sold a ( i ) property and ( ii ) land parcel and a building thereonÂ—our 50 % share of the aggregate gains from these sales was $ 2.1 million , which is included in equity in earnings from sale of unconsolidated joint venture properties . we obtained proceeds of $ 61.7 million from mortgage financings , including $ 14.7 million of refinanced amounts . we raised net proceeds of approximately $ 3.1 million from the issuance of 126,300 shares of common stock pursuant to our at-the-market equity offering program . challenges facing certain tenants and properties we describe below certain risks and uncertainties associated with tenants and properties that are experiencing financial or other challenges . in december 2018 , pm management-round rock al , llc , the tenant at our assisted living facility in round rock , texas , and its parent , senior care centers , llc , filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the u.s. bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas . this property accounted for $ 353,000 , or less than 1.0 % , of 2018 rental income ( after giving effect to the write-off described below ) and $ 2.2 million , or 3.2 % , of 2017 rental income . in 2018 , we wrote-off $ 4.9 million with respect to this property , including a $ 2.7 million write-off of tenant origination costs to depreciation and amortization expense , and a $ 1.4 million write-off against rental income of the balance of the tenant 's unbilled rent receivable . at december 31 , 2018 , the net book value and mortgage debt associated with this property were $ 16.1 million and $ 13.5 million , respectively . in 2017 and 2018 , this tenant paid $ 2 million and $ 1.7 million of base rent , respectively , and in 2019 , this tenant paid $ 349,000 , representing the base rent owed for january and february 2019. we estimate that the carrying costs ( including mortgage interest expense ) for this property in 2019 may exceed $ 1.2 million . harden healthcare , llc and senior care centers , llc guaranteed the payment and performance of the obligations under this lease . we sued the guarantors but can not provide any assurance that we will obtain any recovery therefrom . we are seeking a replacement operator licensed to manage this facility ( a `` licensed operator `` ) . if we do not engage such an operator , we may attempt to sell or re-lease the property . our ability to sell or re-lease this property is constrained by competing facilities in such market and state regulatory requirements mandating that assisted living facilities be operated by a licensed operator . a multi-family complex , which we refer to as the vue , which ground leases from us the underlying land located in beachwood , ohio , experienced a significant decrease in its operating cash flow in 2018 due to a decrease in the property 's occupancy rate . the occupancy rate , which at december 31 , 2018 was 72.1 % , declined during 2018 due to a casualty loss the impact of which was compounded by competition from recently constructed residential buildings . accordingly , effective october 1 , 2018 , ( i ) we and the owner/operator of the vue entered into a lease amendment which , among other things , reduced the annual base rent payable in 2019 pursuant to the ground lease to $ 783,000 ( from an annual base rent of $ 1.6 million in 2018 ) which increases in stages to approximately $ 1.3 million beginning april 2021 and ( ii ) the owner/operator deposited $ 600,000 in escrow to secure the payment of the rent payable from october 2018 through july 2019.

incurred by the owner/operator . story_separator_special_tag the following table summarizes interest expense for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_24_th credit facility interest the decrease in 2017 is due to the $ 11.2 million decrease in the weighted average balance outstanding under our line of credit . the decrease was offset by an increase of 64 basis points in the weighted average interest rate due to the increase in the one month libor rate and an increase of $ 81,000 in the unused facility fee primarily resulting from the $ 25.0 million increase in our borrowing capacity under the facility . mortgage interest the following table reflects the average interest rate on the average principal amount of outstanding mortgage debt during the applicable year : replace_table_token_25_th the increase is due primarily to the increase in the average principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding , offset by a decrease in the average interest rate on outstanding mortgage debt . the increase in the average balance outstanding is due substantially to mortgage debt of $ 72.9 million incurred in connection with properties acquired in 2016 and 2017 and the financing or refinancing of $ 51.5 million of mortgage debt , net of refinanced amounts , in connection with properties acquired prior to 2016. the decrease in the average interest rate is due to the financing ( including financings effectuated in connection with acquisitions ) or refinancing in 2017 and 2016 of $ 158.8 million of gross mortgage debt ( including $ 34.4 million of refinanced amounts ) with an average interest rate of approximately 3.7 % . story_separator_special_tag pursuant to the compensation and services agreement and ( ii ) $ 791,000 will be spent in 2019 with respect

expended in connection with the re-development of the manahawkin property , which we expect will be completed in stages through 2022. as of december 31 , 2018 , we had $ 423 million of mortgage debt outstanding ( excluding mortgage indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures ) , all of which is non-recourse ( subject to standard carve-outs ) . we expect that mortgage interest and amortization payments ( excluding repayments of principal at maturity ) of approximately $ 92.5 million due through 2021 will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations . we anticipate that principal balances due at maturity through 2021 of $ 11.9 million will be paid primarily from cash and cash equivalents and mortgage financings and 43 refinancings . if we are unsuccessful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties , our cash flow , funds available under our credit facility and available cash , if any , may not be sufficient to repay all debt obligations when payments become due , and we may need to issue additional equity , obtain long or short-term debt , or dispose of properties on unfavorable terms . cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 , as amended . accordingly , to qualify as a reit , we must , among other things , meet a number of organizational and operational requirements , including a requirement that we distribute currently at least 90 % of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders . it is our current intention to comply with these

regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years . even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit , we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income taxes on our undistributed taxable income ( i.e . , taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder ) and are subject to federal excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income . it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than 90 % , and , if possible , 100 % of our annual taxable income , including taxable gains from the sale of real estate . it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code . our board of directors reviews the dividend policy regularly to determine if any changes to our dividend should be made . off-balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements other than with respect to land parcels owned by us and located in wheaton , illinois and beachwood , ohio . these parcels are improved by multi-family complexes and we ground leased the parcels to the owner/operators of such complexes . these ground leases generated $ 2.6 million of rental income , net , during 2018 , excluding $ 800,000 generated from our lakemoor , illinois property which was sold in september 2018. at december 31 , 2018 , our maximum exposure to loss with respect to these properties is $ 24.4 million , representing the carrying value of the land ; our leasehold positions are subordinate to an aggregate of $ 106.9 million of mortgage debt

","the retail industry faces significant risks due to the rise of e-commerce, prompting a strategic shift towards acquiring industrial properties that support e-commerce activities. In 2018, retail properties contributed 41.9% of net rental income, while industrial properties accounted for 39.1%. The company's net rental income increased by $2.1 million (3.1%) from 2017, with eight industrial properties acquired for $79.5 million, contributing $5.6 million (8.1%) to 2019's rental income. Three properties were sold, yielding a net gain of $5.3 million, representing 3.0% and 4.7% of 2018 and 2017 rental income, respectively. The company also received $61.7 million from mortgage financings and raised approximately $3.1 million from issuing 126,300 shares. However, challenges arose when a tenant at an assisted living facility filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, leading to a $4.9 million write-off. Additionally, a multi-family complex in Beachwood, Ohio, saw its occupancy drop to 72.1%, prompting a lease amendment that reduced annual base rent from $1.6 million to $783,000 for 2019. The company had $423 million in outstanding mortgage debt, with expected payments of $92.5 million through 2021, primarily funded by operational cash flow. To maintain REIT status, the company intends to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders. Off-balance sheet arrangements include ground leases generating $2.6 million in rental income, with a maximum exposure to loss of $24.4 million related to these properties."

significant accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information ) . the impairment loss was partially offset by an unrealized gain on commodity derivative instruments of $ 197 million and a gain on sale of assets of $ 61 million . see note 3 - acquisitions and dispositions in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information . the following table presents a breakout of net liquid and natural gas sales information to assist in the understanding of the company 's natural gas production and sales portfolio . replace_table_token_29_th 52 natural gas , ngls , and oil sales were $ 793 million for the year ended december 31 , 2016 , compared to $ 727 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 . the increase was primarily due to the 20.0 % increase in total sales volumes , offset in part by the 11.5 % decrease in the average gas sales price per mcf without the impact of derivative instruments . the decrease in average sales price was the result of the overall decrease in general market prices . sales volumes , average sales price ( including the effects of derivative instruments ) , and average costs for all active operations were as follows : replace_table_token_30_th the decrease in average sales price was primarily the result of a $ 0.25 mcf decrease in general market prices in the appalachian basin during the current period , as well as an overall decrease in natural gas liquids pricing . the increase was offset , in part , by a $ 0.02 mcf increase in the realized gain on commodity derivative instruments related to the company 's hedging program . changes in the average costs per mcfe were primarily related to the following items : depreciation , depletion , and amortization decreased on a per-unit basis primarily due to a reduction in marcellus rates as a result of an increase in the company 's marcellus reserves . see note 7 - property , plant , and equipment in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional details . lease operating expense decreased on a per unit basis in the period-to-period comparison due to a decrease in well tending costs and salt water disposal costs , as well as a decrease in both
","In the year ended December 31, 2017, CNX reported a decrease in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs to $93 million from $105 million in 2016, attributed to reduced employee wages and benefits due to headcount reduction. The company recognized a significant gain on the sale of assets amounting to $188 million, a substantial increase from $14 million in 2016, primarily from selling approximately 35,900 net undeveloped acres. A loss on debt extinguishment of $2 million was recorded, while interest expenses decreased to $161 million from $182 million, reflecting the redemption of senior notes. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations was notably negative at (148.9)%, influenced by $279 million in benefits from tax reform, including a $154 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance on alternative minimum tax credits. Exploration and production-related other costs rose to $48 million from $15 million, mainly due to lease expirations. Other operating expenses increased to $112 million from $89 million, driven by idle rig expenses and unutilized firm transportation fees. Overall, CNX's net loss for 2016 was $848 million, or $3.70 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $375 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, in 2015. Natural gas, NGLs, and oil sales were $793 million in 2016, up from $727 million in 2015, despite a 20% increase in sales volumes being offset by an 11.5% decrease in average gas sales prices."
76,"as a result of the reduction in coke volumes during 2020 further discussed below , in august 2020 , we revised our 2020 guidance range for adjusted ebitda from $ 235 million to $ 245 million to $

market challenges presented by the current covid-19 global pandemic , suncoke executed contract amendments with its steelmaking customers to provide near-term coke supply relief in exchange for extending certain contracts . in july 2020 , suncoke reached an agreement with cliffs steel for a supply reduction of 200 thousand tons of coke in 2020 , including a 125 thousand ton reduction at haverhill ii and a 75 thousand ton reduction at middletown , in exchange for extending the haverhill ii contract from december 31 , 2021 to june 30 , 2023. subsequent to these amendments , in october 2020 , the haverhill ii contract was further extended to june 30 , 2025. key provisions of the agreement , including pass-through of coal costs , reimbursement of operating and maintenance expenses subject to certain metrics , and pricing remain unchanged . story_separator_special_tag significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions consist of : ( 1 ) black lung benefit obligations and ( 2 ) accounting for impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets . although our management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances , actual results may differ to some extent from the estimates on which our consolidated financial statements have been prepared at any point in time . despite these inherent limitations , our management believes the â€œ management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations â€ and consolidated financial statements and footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our financial condition . black lung benefit liabilities the company has obligations related to coal workers ' pneumoconiosis , or black lung , benefits to certain of our former coal miners and their dependents . such benefits are provided for under title iv of the federal coal mine and safety act of 1969 and subsequent amendments , as well as for black lung benefits provided in the states of virginia , kentucky and west virginia pursuant to workers ' compensation legislation . the patient protection and affordable care act ( â€œ ppaca â€ ) , which was implemented in 2010 , amended previous legislation related to coal workers ' black lung obligations . ppaca provides for the automatic extension of awarded lifetime benefits to surviving spouses and changes the legal criteria used to 41 assess and award claims . we act as a self-insurer for both state and federal black lung benefits and adjust our liability each year based upon actuarial calculations of our expected future payments for these benefits . our independent actuarial consultants calculate the present value of the estimated black lung liability annually based on actuarial models utilizing our population of former coal miners , historical payout patterns of both the company and the industry , actuarial mortality rates , disability incidence , medical costs , death benefits , dependents , discount rates and the current federally mandated payout rates . the estimated liability may be impacted by future changes in the statutory mechanisms , modifications by court decisions and changes in filing patterns driven by perceptions of success by claimants and their advisors , the impact of which can not be estimated . the following table summarizes discount rates utilized , active claims and the total black lung liabilities : replace_table_token_12_th ( 1 ) the discount rate is determined based on a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities that are consistent with the estimated duration of our black lung obligations . a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased black lung expense by $ 1.6 million in 2020 . ( 2 ) the current portion of the black lung liability was $ 4.6 million at both december 31 , 2020 and 2019 , respectively , and was included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets . the following table summarizes annual black lung payments and expense : replace_table_token_13_th ( 1 ) expenses incurred in excess of annual accretion of the black lung liability primarily reflect the impact of changes in discount rates as well as increases in expected future claims as a result of higher refiling and approval rate assumptions . accounting for impairments goodwill goodwill , which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired , is assessed for impairment as of october 1 of each year , or when events occur or circumstances change that would , more likely than not , reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to below its carrying value . a significant portion of our logistics business has historically been from long-term , take-or-pay contracts with murray american coal , inc. ( `` murray `` ) and foresight energy llc ( `` foresight `` ) , which were adversely impacted by declining coal export prices and domestic demand . murray filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on october 29 , 2019. foresight engaged outside counsel and financial advisors to assess restructuring options during 2019 and subsequently filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on march 10 , 2020. both murray and foresight 's contracts with cmt were subsequently rejected by the bankruptcy courts . the company concluded the impact of the events discussed above could more likely than not reduce the fair value of the logistics reporting unit below its carrying value , requiring suncoke to perform its annual goodwill test as of september 30 , 2019. the fair value of the logistics reporting unit , which was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis , did not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit . key assumptions in our goodwill impairment test included reduced forecasted volumes and reduced rates from foresight , no further business from murray , incremental merchant business and a discount rate of 12 percent , representing the estimated weighted average cost of capital for this business line . as a result , the company recorded a $ 73.5 million non-cash , pre-tax impairment charge to the logistics segment on the consolidated statements of operations during 2019 , which represents a full impairment of the logistics goodwill balance . 42 the company 's total goodwill balance as of december 31 , 2020 was $ 3.4 million . please see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the current goodwill balance . long-lived assets long-lived assets are comprised of properties , plants and equipment as well as our long-lived intangible assets , comprised of customer contracts , customer relationships , and permits . long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable . a long-lived asset , or group of assets , is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be
","In August 2020, Suncoke revised its 2020 guidance for adjusted EBITDA from $235-$245 million to $190-$200 million and for cash generated from operating activities from $170-$180 million to $116-$136 million due to reduced coke volumes. Ultimately, the company delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $205.9 million and generated $157.8 million in operating cash flow, surpassing the revised guidance, with a net income of $8.8 million. The strong performance was attributed to effective cost management and robust domestic coke operations. In December 2020, Suncoke entered a long-term agreement with Javelin Global Commodities for 4 million tons in 2021 and 3 million tons in 2022. The company repurchased 1.6 million shares for $7 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share throughout 2020, while reducing total debt by approximately $110 million. For 2021, Suncoke plans to spend about $80 million on capital expenditures and aims for adjusted EBITDA between $215-$230 million and operating cash flow of $160-$180 million, driven by full capacity operations and new coal handling agreements. Additionally, Suncoke executed contract amendments with steelmaking customers to provide near-term coke supply relief, including a 200,000-ton reduction in supply for Cliffs Steel in exchange for contract extensions. The total goodwill balance as of December 31, 2020, was $3.4 million."

","In 2017, Alliant Energy, IPL, and WPL focused on financial objectives and strategic execution, with significant developments including the enactment of tax reform in December, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, impacting financial statements and requiring re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. IPL's Marshalltown generating station, a 706 MW natural gas-fired facility, began operations in April 2017, with capital expenditures totaling $645 million. Additionally, IPL and WPL planned to expand wind generation by up to 1,000 MW and 200 MW, respectively, by the end of 2020, with IPL filing for a second 500 MW wind generation project in August 2017. WPL also sought approval for a 55 MW wind farm acquisition in Wisconsin. In April 2017, IPL implemented a 7% interim electric base rate increase of $102 million, followed by a proposed 9% increase of $130 million in September. Alliant Energy received $50 million, $39 million, and $11 million in refunds from FERC related to return on equity complaints. The company retired or fuel-switched approximately 75% of its combustion turbines and oil-fired units, targeting a 95% reduction in mercury emissions and 90% reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions by 2020, with a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 40% by 2030. The strategic plan emphasizes a diversified energy portfolio, including natural gas, renewables, and coal, while evaluating future capacity additions based on regulatory policies and customer demand."
78,"as a part of the tax reform law that came into effect in december 2017 , the tax penalty for violating the individual mandate to have qualifying health insurance was reduced to zero effective in 2019 , essentially repealing it . the essential repeal of the individual mandate could have a further adverse impact on the individual and family health insurance market . in addition to the repeal of the mandate , the trump administration issued an executive order in october 2017 that directed the executive branch of the government to consider proposing regulations and revising guidance to expand access to association health plans , expand the availability of short term health 47 insurance and increase the usability of health reimbursement arrangements . as a result of the executive order , new regulations have been proposed that would facilitate association-based health insurance plans and promote the sale of more short term health insurance . the expansion of the use of short term health insurance may cause individuals and families to purchase short term health insurance instead of individual and family health insurance . if adopted , the proposed regulations relating to association health plans would allow small businesses to join industry or geographically-based associations and collectively purchase large group health insurance plans . large group health insurance is not subject to many of the provisions of the affordable care act , including the requirement that health insurance plans cover all of the essential health benefits defined under the affordable care act . the goal of the proposed regulation is to reduce the cost of insurance for individuals who receive their health insurance under associations . the proposed regulations relating to association-based health insurance and short term health insurance could present new business opportunities for us , but also may reduce the size of the individual , family and small business health insurance markets that we address . summary of selected application and membership metrics in addition to traditional financial metrics , we rely upon the several business metrics to evaluate our business performance and facilitate long-term strategic planning . the following table shows certain selected quarterly metrics for the years ended december 31 , 2016 and 2017 : replace_table_token_7_th 48 notes : ( 1 ) medicare-related health insurance applications submitted on our website or through our customer care center during the period , including medicare advantage , medicare part d prescription drug and medicare supplement plans . applications are counted as submitted when the applicant completes the application and either clicks the submit button on our website or provides verbal authorization to submit the application . the applicant may have additional actions to take before the application will be reviewed by the insurance carrier , such as providing additional information . in addition , an applicant may submit more than one application .

( 3 ) applications for health insurance plans other than medicare and ifp submitted on our website during the period . applications for ancillary plans are counted as submitted when the applicant completes the application , clicks the submit button on our website and submits the application to us . applications for small business plans are counted as submitted when the applicant completes the application , the employees complete their applications , the applicant submits the application to us and we submit the application to the carrier . the applicant may have additional actions to take before the application will be reviewed by the insurance carrier , such as providing additional information . in addition , an applicant may submit more than one application . ( 4 ) applications for all health insurance plans submitted on our website or through our customer care center during the period . see notes ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) above for more information as to what constitutes a submitted application . ( 5 ) medicare advantage plan health insurance applications submitted on our website or through our customer care center during the period . applications are counted as submitted when the applicant completes the application and either clicks the submit button on our website or provides verbal authorization to submit the application . the applicant may have additional actions to take before the application will be reviewed by the insurance carrier , such as providing additional information . in addition , an applicant may submit more than one application . medicare advantage submitted applications are included in medicare submitted applications - see note1 above for more detail . ( 6 ) estimated number of members active on medicare-related health insurance as of the date indicated based on the number of members for whom we have received or applied a commission payment during the month of estimation . ( 7 ) estimated number of members active on ifp health insurance plans as of the date indicated . story_separator_special_tag under topic 606 , we expect to recognize significantly lower commission revenue in the first quarter of each year when we have historically recognized commission revenue from medicare-related renewals and expect to instead record significantly greater commission revenue in the fourth quarter of each year as a result of the increase in approved plans we experience during the fourth quarter annual and open enrollment periods . critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles , or u.s. gaap , requires us to make judgments , assumptions , and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes . these estimates and assumptions are based on current facts , historical experience , and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to determine reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources . to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results , our future consolidated results of operations may be affected . an accounting policy is considered to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change , and the effect of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance . the accounting policies we believe to reflect our more significant estimates , judgments and assumptions and are most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are as follows : revenue recognition ; stock-based compensation ; business combinations ; realizability of long-lived assets and ; accounting for income taxes . during the year ended december 31 , 2017 , there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates . 52 revenue recognition we recognize revenue for our services when each of the following four criteria is met : persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered ; the seller 's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable ; and collectability is reasonably assured . our revenue is primarily comprised of compensation paid to us by health insurance carriers related to insurance plans that have been purchased by a member who used our service . we define a member as an individual currently covered by an insurance plan , including medicare-related , individual and family , small business and ancillary plans , for which we are entitled to receive compensation from an insurance carrier . commission revenue we typically enter into contractual agency relationships with health insurance carriers that are non-exclusive and terminable on short notice by either party for any reason . in addition , health insurance carriers often have the ability to terminate or amend our agreements unilaterally on short notice , including provisions in our agreements relating to our commission rates . the amendment or termination of an agreement we have with a health insurance carrier may adversely impact the commissions we are paid on health insurance plans that we have already sold through the carrier . for both medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plans , we receive a fixed , annual commission payment from insurance carriers once the plan is approved by the carrier and either a fixed , monthly or annual commission payment beginning with and subsequent to the second plan year . additionally , commission rates may be higher in the first twelve months of the plan if the plan is the first medicare advantage or medicare part d prescription drug plan issued to the member . in the first plan year of a medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plan , after the health insurance carrier approves the application but during the effective year of the plan , we are paid a fixed commission that is prorated for the number of months remaining in the calendar year . additionally , if the plan is the first medicare advantage or medicare part d plan issued to the member , we may receive a higher commission rate that covers a full twelve-month period , regardless of the month the plan was effective . we earn commission revenue for medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plans for which we are the broker of record , typically until either the policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy . we recognize commission revenue for both medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plans for the entire plan year once the annual or first monthly commission amount for the plan year is reported to us by the carrier , net of an estimate for future forfeiture amounts due to cancellations . for commissions paid to us on a monthly basis , we record a receivable for the commission amounts to be received over the remainder of the plan year , net of an estimate for commission amounts not expected to be collected due to policy cancellations , which is included in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets . we determine that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement when we have a commission agreement with a health insurance carrier . our services are complete when a carrier has approved an application in the initial year and when a member has renewed in a renewal year . the seller 's price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured when a carrier has approved an application and the carrier reports to us the annual or first monthly renewal commission amount for each plan year . for individual and family , medicare supplement , small business and ancillary plans , our compensation generally represents a flat amount per member per month or a percentage of the premium amount collected by the carrier during the period that a member
","The tax reform law enacted in December 2017 eliminated the penalty for not having qualifying health insurance, effective 2019, which may negatively affect the individual and family health insurance market. Additionally, an executive order from October 2017 aimed to broaden access to association health plans and short-term health insurance, potentially leading individuals to opt for these alternatives over traditional plans. Proposed regulations would allow small businesses to join associations to purchase large group health insurance, which is exempt from many Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements, including essential health benefits. This shift could create new business opportunities but may also shrink the individual and family health insurance markets. In terms of performance metrics, the company tracks various health insurance applications, including Medicare-related applications, which are counted upon submission through their website or customer care center. For the year ending December 31, 2017, the company noted that commission revenue recognition would shift significantly, with lower revenue expected in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter due to seasonal enrollment patterns. The companyâ€™s revenue primarily comes from commissions paid by health insurance carriers for plans purchased by members, with specific accounting policies in place for revenue recognition, including criteria such as evidence of arrangement and collectability assurance."
79,"to date , we have grown our user base without material investment in marketing , user acquisition or advertising . we generate over 90 % of our revenues from selling our advertising inventory to advertising networks , advertising exchanges , and direct arrangements with advertisers . advertising networks and advertising exchanges are third party technology platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of media advertising inventory from multiple ad networks . the price of advertising inventory is fixed on an advertising network whereas the price for inventory is determined through bidding on an advertising exchange . advertisers are attracted to us because of our sizable user base and our focus on mobile phone personalization . the remainder of our revenue is primarily generated from our managing and optimizing the advertising inventory of a third-party mobile application publisher , as well as overseeing the billing , collections and reporting related to advertising for this publisher . a key element in maintaining our competitive position is our ability to meet users ' expectations , which necessitates retaining employees with solid educational and professional credentials who are passionate about our mission to serve as a medium for self-expression . our ability to continue attracting advertisers depends on the growth and demographics of our user base , increased app usage and improved retention . these will require continued investment in product , technology and marketing . our growth plan also relies on diversifying our monetization portfolio and selective strategic investments and acquisitions . to this end we recently announced that in late 2017 we expect to rollout a marketplace where artists can monetize their digital creations . in order to accelerate this development we undertook the acquihire of freeform development , inc. we believe that this effort will both drive customer growth and introduce new revenue streams . we believe that our business model is scalable and allows for significant portions of revenue growth to flow to our bottom line . we were formerly a majority-owned subsidiary of idt corporation , or idt . on june 1 , 2016 , idt 's interest in zedge was spun-off by idt to idt 's stockholders and we became an independent public company through a pro rata distribution of our common stock held by idt to idt 's stockholders ( the spin-off ) . reportable segments our business consists of one reportable segment . critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america , or u.s. gaap . the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . critical accounting policies are those that require application of management 's most subjective or complex judgments , often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods . our critical accounting policies include those related to capitalized software and technology development costs , revenue recognition and goodwill . management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies . 20 capitalized software and technology development costs software and technology development activities generally fall into three stages : 1. planning stage activities include developing a project or business plan that outlines the goals for the content distribution platform or new product or service ; determining the functionality ; identifying hardware and software applications that will achieve functionality , security , and traffic flows ; and selecting the internal resources that will be assigned to the project as well as the external vendors where applicable . 2. application and infrastructure development stage activities focus on acquiring or developing hardware and software to operate a content distribution platform or new product and service ; and 3. post-implementation/operating stage activities address training , administration , maintenance , and all other activities to operate an existing content distribution platform or new product or service . during the planning stage , we charge all costs to expense as incurred . during the application and infrastructure development stage , we begin to capitalize costs when the project has been properly authorized and we determine that completion is probable ( if a project is subsequently cancelled prior to placement in service , costs that have been capitalized to date will be reviewed for potential impairment ) . capitalization ceases no later than the point at which a computer software project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use . amortization begins for each project when the code is ready for use , whether or not it is actually placed in service at that time ( an exception being if the project 's functionality completely depends on the completion of another project ; then , amortization begins when that other project is ready for use ) . during the post-implementation/operation stage , we expense training costs and maintenance costs as incurred . however , upgrades and enhancements , defined as modifications to existing internal-use software that result in additional functionality ( modifications to enable the software to perform tasks that it was previously incapable of performing , normally requiring new software specifications and perhaps a change to all or part of the existing software specifications ) are treated as though they were new projects , and are assessed utilizing the same stages and criteria on a project by project basis . story_separator_special_tag the costs associated with content serving increased as a result of a new copyright detecting product from one of our vendors . the costs associated with filtering and push notification marketing increased because of an expansion of the addressable customer base for marketing automation services . selling , general and administrative expense . selling , general and administrative expense consists mainly of payroll , benefits , facilities , marketing , content acquisition and consulting , professional fees , and public company operating costs . the increase in selling , general and administrative expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was mostly due to increases in payroll and benefits , accounting , tax , legal fees , rent , stock-based noncash compensation , and public company operating costs . the increase was partially offset by a reduction in benefits expense in fiscal 2017 due to the recording of a $ 205,000 receivable from norway 's skattefunn government program designed to encourage research and development in norwegian trade and industry , which related to previous periods . in addition , our headcount increased from 54 employees at july 31 , 2016 to 64 employees at july 31 , 2017. in light of our focus on growth and profitability , we expect , excluding the marketplace initiative , to reduce our costs by $ 1.5- $ 2.0 million annually . these savings will be realized from a combination of workforce reduction , infrastructure savings and tighter discretionary spending controls . we believe that these efforts will afford us the resources needed to execute the marketplace initiative well . selling , general and administrative expense included stock-based compensation expense of $ 275,000 and $ 166,000 in fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively . at july 31 , 2017 , unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation was an aggregate of $ 590,000. the unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period of the relevant grant that ends in 2020. depreciation and amortization . depreciation and amortization consists mainly of amortization of capitalized software and technology development costs of our internal developers on various projects that we invested in specific to the various platforms on which we operate our service . write-off of capitalized software and technology development costs . in each of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , we decided to abandon certain software and technology projects that were in development . since these abandoned projects did not have any future benefit , we charged the capitalized software and technology development costs for these projects to expense . net gain ( loss ) resulting from foreign exchange transactions . net gain ( loss ) resulting from foreign exchange transactions are comprised of losses and gains generated from movements in norwegian krone , or nok , relative to the u.s. dollar including gains or losses from our nok hedging activities . in fiscal 2017 and 2016 , we had a gain of $ 105,000 and a loss of $ 142,000 , respectively , from nok hedging activities . benefit from ( provision for ) income taxes . the decrease in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to the jurisdiction in which income was earned in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and our ability to use net operating losses in those jurisdictions . 24 story_separator_special_tag contracts not to exceed $ 5.0 million in the aggregate at any point in time under our revolving credit facility . the available borrowing under the revolving credit facility is reduced by an applicable foreign exchange reserve percentage as determined by western alliance bank , in its reasonable discretion from time to time , which was initially set at 10 % of the nominal amount of the foreign exchange contracts in effect at the relevant time . in december 2016 , the applicable foreign exchange reserve percentage was changed so that so that the reduction of available borrowing for major currency forward contracts of less than six months tenor is set at 10 % of the nominal amount of the foreign exchange contracts , and for contracts over six months tenor , 12.5 % of the nominal amount of the foreign exchange contracts . at july 31 , 2017 , there were $ 2.0 million of outstanding foreign exchange contracts with less than six months tenor under the credit facility , and no contracts of greater than six months tenor , which reduced the available borrowing under the revolving credit facility by $ 200,000. we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock until we achieve sustainable profitability and retain certain minimum cash reserves . the payment of dividends in any specific period will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors . changes in trade accounts receivable gross trade accounts receivable were $ 1.7 million at both july 31 , 2017 and 2016. our cash collections in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were $ 10.9 million and $ 12.8 million , respectively . concentration of credit risk and significant customers historically , we have had very little or no bad debt , which is common with other platforms of our size that derive their revenue from digital advertising , as we aggressively manage our collections and perform due diligence on our customers . in addition , the majority of our revenue is derived from large , credit-worthy customers , e.g . mopub ( owned by twitter ) , ogury , google , and millennial media , and we terminate our services with smaller customers immediately upon balances becoming past due . since these smaller customers rely on us to derive their own revenue , they generally pay their outstanding balances on a timely basis . in fiscal 2017 , three customers represented 43 % , 17 % and 10 % of our revenue , and in fiscal 2016 , three customers represented 45 % , 20 % and 13
","the company has expanded its user base significantly without substantial marketing investments, generating over 90% of its revenue from advertising inventory sales to networks and exchanges. The revenue model is primarily driven by a sizable user base focused on mobile personalization, with additional income from managing third-party advertising for mobile app publishers. The company plans to diversify its revenue streams and enhance user engagement through a new marketplace for artists, expected to launch in late 2017, supported by the acquihire of Freeform Development, Inc. Financially, the company transitioned to an independent public entity in June 2016 after being spun off from IDT Corporation. As of July 31, 2017, the company had 64 employees, up from 54 the previous year, and anticipated annual cost reductions of $1.5 to $2.0 million, excluding marketplace initiatives. Selling, general, and administrative expenses rose due to increased payroll and benefits, totaling $275,000 in stock-based compensation for fiscal 2017. The company reported gross trade accounts receivable of $1.7 million for both July 31, 2017, and 2016, with cash collections of $10.9 million in fiscal 2017, down from $12.8 million in 2016. Notably, three major customers accounted for 43%, 17%, and 10% of revenue in fiscal 2017, reflecting a concentration of credit risk. The company has maintained minimal bad debt, primarily serving large, creditworthy clients like MoPub, Google, and Ogury."
80,"this focus led to the continuing increase in unifi 's pva sales as a percentage of its overall sales , with net sales from pva products representing approximately 40 % of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017. this continues a growth trend of between 10 % and 15 % over the past several fiscal years . unifi 's strategy of enriching its product mix through a focus on pva products helps insulate it from the pressures of low-priced commodity yarn imports and helps to establish unifi as an innovation leader in its core markets . unifi 's innovative and sustainable products achieved growth in overseas markets , continuing to meet the demands of premier brands and retailers worldwide . 22 unifi 's flagship repreve Â® brand continued as our fastest growing pva solution during fiscal 2017. the increasing success and awarenes s of the repreve Â® brand continues to provide new opportunities for growth , allowing for expansion into new end-uses and markets for repreve Â® , as well as continuing to grow the brand with current customers . both brands and consumers are demanding more susta inable solutions that provide better performance characteristics , and repreve Â® is positioned to benefit from this trend . fiscal 2017 marked the third year of a three-year $ 135,000 capital investment plan . beginning with fiscal 2015 , unifi invested approximately $ 35,000 in capital projects , adding machinery to support expansion of its draw-textured and air-jet textured businesses , launching its third production line in the repreve Â® recycling center and installing a 1-megawatt capacity solar farm . in fiscal 2016 , unifi invested approximately $ 60,000 in capital projects , including the bottle processing facility , commencing another repreve Â® recycling center expansion and enhancing automation systems and existing machinery to handle the increasingly complex product mix . unifi invested approximately $ 40,000 in capital projects in fiscal 2017 , completing construction of its bottle processing facility , nearing completion of the fourth production line in the repreve Â® recycling center , and completing construction of assets for production of specialized fibers in partnership with eastman chemical company , along with additional enhancements to existing assets for customized and small-lot solutions . to appropriately leverage the significant investments made in machinery and equipment in recent years , unifi expects to make additional investments in certain growth initiatives , including commercial expansion ; technology and innovation ; strategic partnerships ; and people and teams . when executed with synergy , these initiatives are expected to increase the returns from unifi 's core competencies by utilizing a premier supply chain and state-of-the-art equipment to deliver technology-driven solutions backed by innovation and sustainability to like-minded customers worldwide . these initiatives are expected to increase net sales , gross margins and operating income while causing sg & a expenses to increase correspondingly . raw material components represent a significant portion of unifi 's manufactured products . the prices for the principal raw materials used by unifi continually fluctuate , and it is difficult , and often impossible , to predict trends or upcoming developments . during fiscal 2017 , unifi operated in a predominantly increasing virgin polyester raw material cost environment . unifi believes those costs were a result of volatility in the crude oil markets . during fiscal 2016 and 2015 , unifi operated in a predominantly declining virgin polyester raw material cost environment . unifi believes that costs during most of that two-year period were impacted by lower crude oil values , a lack of major unplanned raw material capacity outages and soft global demand for polyester raw materials . the continuing volatility in global crude oil prices is likely to impact unifi 's polyester and nylon raw material costs . while it is not possible to predict the timing or amount of the impact or whether the decline in crude oil prices will stabilize , continue or reverse , unifi monitors these dynamic factors closely . unifi is also impacted by significant fluctuations in the value of the brazilian real , the local currency for our largest foreign operation . in fiscal 2017 , the brazilian real strengthened versus the u.s. dollar . such appreciation of the brazilian real improves our net sales and other performance metrics when the results of our brazilian subsidiary are translated into u.s. dollars at comparatively favorable rates . during fiscal 2016 and 2015 , unifi was negatively impacted by relative weakening of the brazilian real . specifically , the brazilian real declined approximately 40 % in relation to the u.s. dollar in fiscal 2015. unifi expects continued volatility in the value of the brazilian real to impact our key performance metrics , although the magnitude of the impact is dependent upon the significance of the volatility . 23 results of operations fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 all consisted of 52 weeks . the following table presents a summary of net income : replace_table_token_5_th see note 25 , â€œ business segment information , â€ to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for reconciliations and detail regarding unifi 's reportable segments , discussion and analysis of which follows below . key performance indicators and non-gaap financial measures unifi continuously reviews performance indicators to measure its success . these performance indicators form the basis of management 's discussion and analysis included below : sales volume and revenue for unifi and for each reportable segment ; gross profit and gross margin for unifi and for each reportable segment ; net income and earnings per share ; segment profit ( loss ) , which equals segment gross profit plus segment depreciation expense ; unit conversion margin , which represents unit net sales price less unit raw material costs , for unifi and for each reportable segment ; working capital , which represents current assets less current

operating ( income ) expense , net other operating ( income ) expense , net changed favorably from $ 2,248 of expense for fiscal 2016 to $ 310 of income for fiscal 2017. other operating ( income ) expense , net for fiscal 2017 primarily includes favorable foreign currency exchange rates , while the total for fiscal 2016 primarily includes key employee transition costs . consolidated interest expense , net interest expense , net increased from $ 2,918 for fiscal 2016 to $ 3,061 for fiscal 2017 , and reflected the following components : replace_table_token_15_th interest on debt obligations increased from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 in connection with an increase in the weighted average interest rate and an increase in capital lease obligations . the change in other components of interest expense from the prior period is primarily attributable to a favorable change in the mark-to-market adjustment for the historical interest rate swap . interest income in each period includes earnings recognized on cash equivalents held globally . loss on sale of business on december 23 , 2016 , unifi , through a wholly owned foreign subsidiary , entered into an agreement to sell its 60 % equity ownership interest in renewables to its existing third-party joint venture partner for $ 500 in cash and release of certain debt obligations . in connection with the transaction , unifi recognized a loss on sale of business of $ 1,662 . 32 consolidated earnings from unconsolidated affiliates the components of earnings from unconsolidated affiliates are as follows : replace_table_token_16_th unifi 's 34 % share of pal 's earnings decreased from $ 6,074 in fiscal 2016 to $ 2,723 in fiscal 2017. the decrease is primarily attributable to lower volumes and operating margins , mostly as a result of a challenging domestic cotton market . the earnings from the nylon joint ventures experienced a decrease primarily due to higher raw material costs and softness in the nylon markets . consolidated income taxes the change in consolidated income taxes is as follows : replace_table_token_17_th the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 benefited from , among other things , ( i ) a lower overall effective tax rate for unifi 's foreign earnings ( reflecting free-trade zone sales in el salvador and lower statutory tax rates in both brazil and china ) , ( ii ) increased research and development credits , ( iii ) a decrease in the valuation allowance reflecting the recognition of lower taxable income versus book income for unifi 's investment in pal ( for which unifi maintains a full valuation allowance ) and ( iv ) a reduction in the valuation allowance related to foreign net operating losses utilized in 2017. such favorable impacts to the fiscal 2017 effective tax rate were partially offset by ( a ) a reduction in the domestic production activities deduction due to the carryback of certain losses , ( b ) a change in uncertain tax positions and ( c ) withholding taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings . the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 benefited from , among other things , ( i ) a lower overall effective tax rate for unifi 's foreign earnings ( reflecting free-trade zone sales in el salvador and lower statutory tax rates in both brazil and china ) , ( ii ) a decrease in the valuation allowance reflecting the recognition of lower taxable income versus book income for unifi 's investment in pal ( for which unifi maintains a full valuation allowance ) and ( iii ) a reduction in the valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits utilized in 2016. such favorable impacts to the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate were partially offset by ( a ) utilization of foreign tax credits , ( b ) an increase in the valuation allowance for net operating losses , including renewables , for which no tax benefit could be recognized , ( c ) state and local taxes net of the assumed federal benefit and ( d ) a change in uncertain tax positions . the favorable change in the effective tax rate from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 is primarily attributable to both a greater mix of foreign earnings and increased research and development credits in fiscal 2017 . 33 consolidated net income attributable to unifi , inc. net income for fiscal 2017 was $ 32,875 , or $ 1.81 per basic share , compared to $ 34,415 , or $ 1.93 per basic share , for fiscal 2016. the decrease was primarily attributable to ( i ) lower earnings from equity affiliates and ( ii ) an increase in sg & a expenses , partially offset by ( a ) the recognition of a benefit for bad debts , ( b ) a lower effective tax rate and ( c ) favorable foreign currency exchange rates . gross profit improved slightly versus the prior fiscal year due to growth in sales of pva products , especially in the international segment , which was partially offset by a difficult domestic environment and fluctuating virgin polyester raw material costs temporarily depressing domestic gross margins . consolidated adjusted ebitda from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 , adjusted ebitda increased from $ 65,357 to $ 65,593. the increase is primarily attributable to growth in sales of pva products , a benefit for bad debts , and favorable foreign currency exchange rates , partially offset by certain volume declines attributable to a difficult domestic retail environment and higher sg & a expenses .

","Unifi's PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) product sales represented approximately 40% of its consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017, continuing a growth trend of 10-15% over previous years. The company's flagship RepreveÂ® brand was its fastest-growing PVA solution, driving expansion into new markets and end-uses. Unifi's capital investment plan, totaling $135000 over three years, included $35000 in fiscal 2015, $60000 in fiscal 2016, and $40000 in fiscal 2017, aimed at enhancing production capabilities and sustainability initiatives. In fiscal 2017, Unifi's net income was $32875 ($1.81 per share), a decrease from $34415 ($1.93 per share) in fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower earnings from equity affiliates and increased selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses.  The company faced challenges from fluctuating raw material costs, particularly in a rising virgin polyester cost environment, and the strengthening Brazilian real positively impacted its performance metrics. Unifi's effective tax rate improved due to a favorable mix of foreign earnings and increased research and development credits.

independent third party . the independent third party 's valuation of the mortgage servicing rights is based on relevant characteristics of the company 's loan servicing portfolio , such as loan terms , interest rates and recent national prepayment experience , as well as current national market interest rate levels , market forecasts and other economic conditions . management , with the advice from its third party valuation firm , review the assumptions related to prepayment speeds , discount rates , and capitalized mortgage servicing income on a quarterly basis . changes are reflected in the following quarter 's analysis related to the mortgage servicing asset . in addition , based upon the independent third party 's valuation of the company 's mortgage servicing rights , management then establishes a valuation allowance by each strata , if necessary , to quantify the likely impairment of the value of the mortgage servicing rights to the company . the estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates are inherently uncertain , and different estimates could have a material impact on the company 's net income and results of operations . the valuation allowance is evaluated and adjusted quarterly by management to reflect changes in the fair value of the underlying mortgage servicing rights based on market conditions . the accuracy of these estimates and assumptions by management and its third party can be directly tied back to the fact that management has not been required to record a valuation allowance through its income statement based upon the valuation of each stratum of serving rights . for more information regarding the estimates and calculations used to establish the alll and the value of mortgage servicing rights , please see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements provided herewith . 22 2019 in review the company completed the merger with limberlost on january 1 , 2019 and three weeks later integrated the bank of geneva into the farmers & merchants state bank 's core operating system . great benefits will follow as the company continues its strategy for long-term sustainable growth from the six offices that have been added . financially , the merger was accretive to earnings during 2019 , with a larger legal lending limit enabling the expansion of existing customer 's borrowings and a wider range of products and services now available to all customers . f & m continues to operate on the foundation of a strong community bank platform in the communities we serve . federal rate increases and the addition of higher yielding assets from the acquisition resulted in a widening of the net interest margin through second quarter 2019. in the second half of the year , fed reduced rates three times within a ninety one day period beginning on august 1 , 2019. pressure continues to build on cost of funds as depositors seek out higher rates . the bank has offered new products in 2019 to attract new depositors and for current depositors to increase their holdings with us . competitive pressure has forced us to increase rates and thereby put pressure on the margin . the company again reports record earnings in total and in earnings per share . this was achieved even with the acquisition costs associated with the merger deal completed january 1 , 2019. earnings per share , with acquisition costs excluded , would have been $ 1.75 as reported in note 2 proforma statements which is higher than $ 1.66 as reported in note 12. the improvement is credited to a widening of the net interest margin , loan growth and the change in the effective income tax rate , offset by increases in noninterest expense , primarily attributable to salaries , wages and employee benefits . the company 's asset size grew $ 491.2 million with net loans accounting for $ 372.2 million , and the remaining difference mainly coming from an increase in securities of $ 53.8 million , goodwill of $ 43.3 million and cash and equivalents of $ 12.9 million . a chief people officer was added in second quarter 2019 to assist with increasing the level of our company 's talent . the company has invested in our retail infrastructure and has been conducting extensive training . during the second and third quarters , the company spent time developing a three year strategic plan . the vision statement was updated to be â€œ community vested to help people realize their best lives . â€ an outcome of the strategic planning process included the following five strategic initiatives that will help take the company to the next level : customer acquisition and retention , talent optimization , actively pursue acquisition opportunities , improve operating efficiency and financial performance , and develop a comprehensive digital strategy for internal and external constituencies . 2019 was an unexpected agricultural grain production year as much of our banking territory experienced an unusually wet spring which resulted in a large area of unplanted acres . the year concluded with better revenue results than anticipated as the crops that did get planted yielded better than expected , the government subsidies were more than originally forecasted , and the crop insurance proved to be a key revenue source . this combined with the fact that area farmers in general have been conservative in the preceding years resulted in financial stress that being significantly mitigated . recent land sales have showed no real sign of reduction in the price per acre . financial stability and overall optimism in land ownership continues to buoy the market . the agri-businesses had a very tight financial year as they did not have the same safety nets the farmers had available to them to offset the reduced revenues . story_separator_special_tag total interest earning assets is therefore also reflecting a tax equivalent yield in both line items , also with the net interest spread and margin . the adjustments were based on a 34 % tax rate for 2017 and a 21 % tax rate for 2018 and 2019 . 26 replace_table_token_8_th 27 replace_table_token_9_th 28 replace_table_token_10_th 29 the following tables show changes in interest income , interest expense and net interest resulting from changes in volume and rate variances for major categories of earnings assets and interest b earing liabilities . replace_table_token_11_th replace_table_token_12_th non-interest income the discussion now focuses on the non-interest income and expense generated from the company for the years ended 2017 through 2019. non-interest income increased in total for 2019 as compared to 2018 , ending at $ 11.8 million . 2018 had non-interest income of $ 10.9 million which exceeded 2017 's $ 10.7 million . components of non-interest income for 2019 which improved over both 2018 and 2017 were combined service charge revenue from the business accounts and consumer accounts which is included in the other service charges and fees line of the consolidated income statement . 2019 combined service charge revenue was $ 20.2 thousand higher than 2018 while 2018 was $ 53.1 thousand higher than 2017 , mainly due to the increased number of accounts that had service charges attached to them . during the second quarter 2017 , new business checking products were announced and existing business accounts were converted to one of three new products , business essential , edge or elite . the new products provided customers with new options to bundle services and for the bank to utilize the full relationship to determine pricing . this was a continuation of the 30 bank 's â€œ earn to free â€ strategic initiative . overdraft , returned check ch arges and recurring overdraft fees from combined business accounts and consumer accounts increased $ 257.9 thousand over 2018. upgrades to our digital products and services continue to occur in both retail and business lines . increases in the number of acc ounts and the number of services being utilized by our customers accounted for the increase in fees over the last two years . the bank has long promoted the use of debit cards by its customers and continues to build on that philosophy with the introduction of new products . during 2019 the bank collected interchange revenue , combined with fees collected on foreign atm fees ( noncustomers utilizing our atms ) , of $ 3.4 million which was $ 465.5 thousand higher than 2018 and $ 167.5 thousand higher than 2017. while this revenue stream continues to improve with more depositors using electronic methods for purchasing , the expense attributable to card fraud has offset a portion of the revenue gain . further discussion can be found in the non-interest section regarding the net effect of debit card activity . noninterest income from net gain on sales of loans was the highest in 2017 of the three year periods shown . the change may be related to the increase in rates after the long duration of the flat interest rate environment . the net gain on sale of loans is derived from sales of real estate loans into the secondary market . of these loan types , the bank sells 100 % of the residential loans and 90 % of the agricultural loans . 56 % of the gains were attributed to the residential loans in 2019 , 66.5 % in 2018 and 80 % in 2017. in conjunction with these sales , the bank maintains servicing rights and those income amounts during all three years are included in the customer service fee income line item and accounted for $ 731 thousand in 2019 , $ 449 thousand in 2018 and $ 460 thousand in revenue for 2017. the last item in the non-interest income section is the net gain of sale of investments . the bank has sold securities over the last three years for two main purposes : to provide funds for loan growth and to take advantage of the position of the yield curve when a gain can be recognized on sales without extending the duration of the portfolio longer than wanted . 2019 and 2018 had limited sales for gain recognition due to the flatness of the yield curve which began to occur in second half of 2017. the bank will not increase short-terms gains at the sacrifice of long-term profitability . the available for sale security portfolio switched from an unrealized loss position into an unrealized gain position in 2019. sales in 2017 were made early in the first quarter before the additional federal reserve rate hike in march and again in may before the june rate hike . these sales recognized much lower gains than in prior years . the bank recognized net losses of $ 26.3 thousand in 2019 and net gains of $ 9.8 thousand in 2018 and $ 46.9 thousand for 2017. the company also recognized a gain on sale of securities from the holding company of $ 0.4 thousand in 2019 while proceeds from 2018 were used to provide cash for the acquisition with the losses totaling $ 19.2 thousand . the net effect of the consolidated number is what shows on the line item of net loss of $ 26 thousand for 2019 and $ 9 thousand for 2018. non-interest expense noninterest expense increased 29.1 % in 2019 as compared to 2018 and was preceded by a 12.1 % increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 . represented in dollars , 2019 was $ 9.4 million higher than 2018 and 2018 was $ 3.5 million higher than 2017 . the largest factor behind the increase in both years was the expense of employee salaries and wages . during 2019 , an additional $ 2.6 million was spent over 2018 which correlates to an 18.7 % increase . when making the
","In an effort to accurately assess the value of its mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), the company engages an independent third party for valuation, which considers factors such as loan terms, interest rates, and national prepayment trends. Management reviews assumptions related to prepayment speeds and discount rates quarterly, adjusting the valuation allowance for potential impairments as necessary. The company reported a significant asset growth of $491.2 million in 2019, with net loans contributing $372.2 million and securities increasing by $53.8 million. Following a merger with Limberlost on January 1, 2019, the company experienced an accretive impact on earnings, with earnings per share (EPS) reaching $1.75, excluding acquisition costs, compared to $1.66 previously. Non-interest income rose to $11.8 million in 2019, up from $10.9 million in 2018, driven by increased service charge revenue. The company also faced competitive pressure to raise deposit rates, impacting net interest margins. Despite challenges in the agricultural sector, overall financial stability was maintained, with land prices remaining steady. The strategic initiatives for future growth include customer acquisition, talent optimization, and enhancing digital strategies."

impacts of covid-19 in march 2020 , the world health organization declared the rapidly spreading covid-19 outbreak a pandemic . in response to the covid-19 pandemic , governments across the world implemented a number of measures to prevent its spread , including but not limited to , the temporary closure of a substantial number of gaming operations establishments and disruptions to lottery operations , travel restrictions , and cancellation of sporting events , which are affecting our business segments in a number of ways . during the latter part of the second quarter and throughout the remainder of 2020 , lifting of restrictions began , 51 including the reopening of the majority of gaming establishments globally and resumption of sporting events . during the fourth quarter of 2020 and in the response to the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic , certain jurisdictions implemented additional temporary closures . as gaming operations have yet to return to pre-covid levels , limited international travel , social distancing measures ( which in some cases have required our customers to substantially reduce maximum floor capacity in many jurisdictions ) , decreased operating capacities , high unemployment rates and potential changes in consumer behaviors continued to negatively impact our results of operations , cash flows and financial condition throughout 2020. additionally , while most of casinos have reopened , it is unknown when mitigation measures ( such as capacity limitations ) will be lifted , all contributing to continued uncertainty into 2021. impact on business operations and financial results our gaming business segment was especially impacted due to the widespread temporary closures and restricted reopening of a substantial number of gaming operations establishments coupled with global economic uncertainty . the covid-19 pandemic remains a rapidly evolving situation . although businesses impacted by temporary closures during 2020 largely reopened domestically , our participation gaming business revenue and cash flows continued to be significantly negatively affected , as they are largely driven by players ' disposable incomes and level of gaming activity . social distancing measures that were implemented in many jurisdictions have and are expected to continue to have a negative impact on the amount of customer traffic within gaming establishments . the covid-19 disruptions continue to cause periods of closures and modified operating schedules and may result in changes in customer behaviors , including a reduction in consumer discretionary spending as a result of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic and unemployment levels . additionally , our gaming machine and table product sales largely depend on our customers ' liquidity and operating results , which have negatively impacted the replacement cycle and demand for gaming machines , table products and opportunities from new or expanded markets . further , we have granted customer concessions for a portion of the time for which such customers ' operations were impacted by closures . also , based on historical gaming customers ' orders and our manufacturing capacity , a substantial portion of gaming machine sales are fulfilled in the third month of each quarter . since march of 2020 when the covid-19 disruptions became widespread , gaming machine sales revenues have been and continue to be particularly negatively impacted . we believe this negative trend could reduce the capital expenditures of casino operators and continue to lengthen the replacement cycles of their existing gaming machines . unfavorable economic conditions caused by covid-19 have caused and could continue to impact the timing of cash receipts from our gaming customers . in addition , unfavorable economic conditions have caused , and could continue to cause , some of our gaming customers to temporarily close gaming venues or ultimately declare bankruptcy , which would adversely affect our business . in recent years , our gaming business has expanded the use of extended payment term financing for gaming machine purchases primarily in the latam region , and we expect to continue to provide a higher level of extended payment term financing in this business until demand from our customers for such financings abates or our business model changes . these financing arrangements may increase our collection risk , and if customers are not able to pay us , whether as a result of financial difficulties , bankruptcy or otherwise , we may incur provisions for bad debt related to our inability to collect certain receivables . in addition , both extended payment term financing and operating leases result in a delay in our receipt of cash , which reduces our cash balance , liquidity and financial flexibility to respond to changing economic events . unfavorable economic conditions may also result in volatility in the credit and equity markets . the difficulty or inability of our customers to generate or obtain adequate levels of capital to finance their ongoing operations may reduce their ability to purchase our products and services . refer to note 6 for international locations with significant concentrations of our receivables with terms longer than one year . story_separator_special_tag r & d r & d decreased primarily due to company-wide austerity measures in response to the covid-19 disruptions described above resulting in lower r & d compensation and benefit expenses of $ 15 million for 2020. d & a d & a decreased primarily due to certain gaming intangible assets and software becoming fully amortized in the prior year . goodwill impairment 56 goodwill impairment increase was related to our legacy u.k. gaming reporting unit ,

","Tim Throsby and Hamish McLennan were appointed as independent directors of a reconstituted board on October 1, 2020, and October 29, 2020, respectively, focusing on de-leveraging and maximizing stockholder value. The board saw the resignation of Ronald Perelman and two other representatives on September 16, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic, declared a global pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, led to widespread gaming operation closures and disruptions, significantly impacting business operations. By the end of Q2 2020, restrictions began to lift, allowing most gaming establishments to reopen, but the fourth quarter saw renewed closures due to a second wave of infections. Throughout 2020, gaming operations struggled to return to pre-pandemic levels, with social distancing measures and high unemployment rates affecting customer traffic and disposable income. The gaming segment's revenue and cash flows were severely impacted, with a notable decline in gaming machine sales, which are typically fulfilled in the third month of each quarter. Research and development expenses decreased by $15 million due to austerity measures, while goodwill impairment charges increased, particularly in the UK gaming sector. The net loss attributable to the company for 2020 was influenced by a decrease in interest expenses from $589 million in 2019 to $503 million in 2020, alongside losses on debt financing transactions and foreign exchange fluctuations. The company anticipates continued challenges in cash flow and customer liquidity, potentially leading to further temporary closures or bankruptcies among gaming customers."
83,"the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . on an ongoing basis , management evaluates its estimates and judgments , including those related to stock-based compensation . management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a Â“critical accounting estimateÂ” where : the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change ; and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material . our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. not all of these significant policies , however , fit the definition of critical accounting policies and estimates . we believe that our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition , stock-based compensation and research and development prepayments , accruals and related expenses fit the description of critical accounting estimates and judgments . revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the financial accounting standards board 's ( fasb ) accounting standards codification ( asc ) topic 605 , revenue recognition . accordingly , revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met : persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered ; the seller 's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable ; and collectability is reasonably assured . amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recognized as deferred revenue in our balance sheet . amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue , current . amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue , net of current portion . our revenues have primarily been generated through collaborative research , development and or commercialization agreements . the terms of these agreements typically may include payment to us of one or more of the following : nonrefundable , up-front license fees , research , development and commercial milestone payments , other contingent payments due based on the activities of the counterparty or the reimbursement by licensees of costs associated with patent maintenance . each of these types of revenue are recorded as alliance revenues in our statement of operations . for each collaborative research , development and or commercialization agreement , which results in revenues , we determine ( i ) whether multiple deliverables exist , ( ii ) whether the delivered elements have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis , ( iii ) how the deliverables should be separated or combined and ( iv ) how the consideration should be allocated to the deliverables . 59 our multiple element revenue arrangements may include the following : up-front license fees : if a license does not have stand-alone value , we recognize revenues from nonrefundable , up-front license fees on a straight-line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance of the services under the related agreement , unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern . we evaluate the period of performance each reporting period and adjust the period of performance on a prospective basis if there are changes to be made . if a license were to have stand-alone value and the other criteria of revenue recognition were satisfied , then revenue would be recognized in the period earned . milestone payments : at the inception of an agreement that includes research and development milestone payments , we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive or represents a deliverable of the counterparty to the agreement . we recognize revenues related to substantive milestones in full in the period in which the substantive milestone is achieved if payment is reasonably assured . if a milestone is a deliverable of the counterparty to the agreement , it is considered contingent revenue and is recognized when we are informed by the counterparty that they have achieved it and such amount is reasonably assured of payment . research and development activities : if we are entitled to reimbursement from our collaborators for specified research and development activities or the reimbursement of costs associated with patent maintenance , we determine whether such funding would result in alliance revenues or an offset to research and development expenses . reimbursement of patent maintenance costs are recognized during the period in which the related expenses are incurred as alliance revenues in our statement of operations . under the terms of the gsk agreement , we are eligible to receive up to approximately $ 100 million in license , research , clinical development and commercialization milestone payments , including a $ 2.5 million upfront , non-refundable , non-creditable cash payment . approximately $ 9.0 million of the milestone payments are payable by gsk upon the identification of additional targets , the completion of current and future research plans and the designation of development candidates . approximately $ 89.0 million is payable by gsk upon the achievement of clinical milestones and commercial milestones . story_separator_special_tag the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2015 was partially offset by decreases in consulting and recruiting expenses . we expect general and administrative expenses to increase during 2016 , as compared to 2015 , due to additional headcount to support our drug development programs . general and administrative expenses increased by $ 3.6 million , or 47 % , from $ 7.7 million in 2013 to $ 11.3 million in 2014. the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2014 , as compared to 2013 , was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation costs primarily attributable to options granted in the latter part of 2013 and the recognition of amortization associated with options subject to accelerated vesting , higher cash compensation costs , including additional headcount associated with our strategic focus on our rare disease and oncology programs , the addition of a new chief executive officer in december 2014 , and the accrual of incentive compensation , and increases in corporate communications , investor relations , recruiting expenses , higher legal costs associated with patent matters , and accounting and auditing fees , including the cost of sarbanes-oxley compliance and the related internal control audit . the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2014 was partially offset by a decrease in consulting fees associated with business and strategic initiatives and lower corporate legal expenses as compared to 2013. interest income interest income increased by $ 0.3 million , from $ 0.1 million in 2014 to $ 0.4 million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in investment balances , including corporate debt securities , in 2015 resulting from our follow-on underwritten public offering in february 2015 and warrant and option exercises since september 30 ,

underwritten public offerings in september 2013 and february 2014 and warrant and option exercises . interest income was negligible in 2013 because most of our invested funds were deposited in a money market fund , which paid minimal interest . interest expense interest expense increased during 2015 , as compared to 2014 due to interest on our note payable which we incurred pursuant to our loan and

","The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management evaluates these estimates continuously, particularly regarding stock-based compensation, based on historical experience and other reasonable factors. Critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, and research and development expenses. Revenue is recognized when specific criteria are met, including evidence of an arrangement and assurance of collectability. The company has collaborative agreements that may yield up to $100 million in milestone payments from GSK, including a $2.5 million upfront payment. General and administrative expenses rose by 47%, from $7.7 million in 2013 to $11.3 million in 2014, driven by increased stock-based compensation and headcount. Interest income increased from $0.1 million in 2014 to $0.4 million in 2015 due to higher investment balances. The net loss applicable to common stockholders was $48.6 million, $39.2 million, and $21.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, contributing to an accumulated deficit of $500.1 million by the end of 2015. The company has faced limitations on utilizing net operating loss carryforwards due to ownership changes exceeding 50% since 2012, with cumulative federal and state NOLs of approximately $121.0 million and $114.1 million available as of December 31, 2015."
84,"in prior years , each retailer induced their consumer with a proprietary brand ( especially soft drinks ) , but today understand s that the well-informed , smart consumer is demanding that retailers provide recognizable brands that have earned their respective consumer standing on their merits . ( 2 ) retail today is in the most competitively-indexed service industry , without exception . innovation , plus the urgent time demands on the consumer , requires quick , expedient shopping . home delivery is even more of a current shoppers ' choice . retailers can not carry slower-moving items that home delivery will not support . ( 3 ) the new consumer is the most competent/knowledgeable product analyzer ever , and personal mental/physical lifestyles demand that healthier is their preferred choice . calories must qualify as worthy ; sugar being enemy # 1 in the life of the millennial and younger consumers . our strategy seeks the profitable growth of our products by ( i ) developing healthier beverages in response to the global shift in consumer buying habits and tailoring our beverage portfolio to the preferences of a diverse mix of â€˜ crossover consumers ' â€“ a growing group desiring a healthier alternative to artificially sweetened and high-caloric beverages ; ( ii ) emphasizing unique flavor development and variety throughout our brands that appeal to multiple demographic groups ; ( iii ) maintaining points of difference through innovative marketing , packaging and consumer engagement and ( iv ) responding faster and more creatively to changing consumer trends than larger competitors who are burdened by legacy production and distribution complexity and costs . 17 presently , our primary market focus is the united states and canada . certain of our products are also distributed on a limited basis in other countries and options to expand distribution to other regions are being considered . to service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers , as well as thousands of smaller â€œ up-and-down-the-street â€ accounts , we utilize a hybrid distribution system consisting of warehouse and direct-store delivery . the warehouse delivery system allows our retail partners to further maximize their assets by utilizing their ability to pick up product at our warehouses , further lowering their/our product costs . national beverage corp. is incorporated in delaware and began trading as a public company on the nasdaq stock market in 1991. in this report , the terms â€œ we , â€ â€œ us , â€ â€œ our , â€ â€œ company â€ and â€œ national beverage â€ mean national beverage corp. and its subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise . our operating results are affected by numerous factors , including fluctuations in the costs of raw materials , holiday and seasonal programming and weather conditions . while prior years witnessed more seasonality , higher sales are realized during the summer when outdoor activities are more prevalent . our highly innovative business , where new beverages are developed and produced for selective holidays and ceremonial dates , should not be analyzed on the common three-month ( quarterly ) periods , traditionally found acceptable . today , costly development projects and seasonal weather periods plus promotional packaging , make quarter-to-quarter comparisons unworthy statistics and forces companies to decision making for that purpose , not truly beneficial for investors and shareholders alike . traditional and typical are not a part of an innovator 's vocabulary . 18 results of operations the following section generally discusses the fiscal years ended may 2 , 2020 ( fiscal 2020 ) and april 27 , 2019 ( fiscal 2019 ) items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. discussions of fiscal year ended april 28 , 2018 ( fiscal 2018 ) items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 can be found in â€œ management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations â€ in part ii , item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended april 27 , 2019 , which is available free of charge on our website at www.nationalbeverage.com . fiscal 2020 consisted of 53 weeks ;

85,"the test services we offer include probe testing and final testing . our packaging services are designed to meet application and chip specific requirements including the type of interconnect technology employed ; size ; thickness and electrical , mechanical and thermal performance . we are able to provide turnkey packaging and test services including semiconductor wafer bump , wafer probe , wafer backgrind , package design , packaging , test and drop shipment services . our customers include , among others : altera corporation ; analog devices , inc. ; broadcom corporation ; intel corporation ; lsi corporation ; qualcomm incorporated ; sony corporation ; stmicroelectronics n.v. ; texas instruments incorporated and toshiba corporation . the outsourced semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive . we also compete with the internal semiconductor packaging and test capabilities of many of our customers . our business is impacted by market conditions in the semiconductor industry , which is cyclical by nature and impacted by broad economic factors , such as world-wide gross domestic product and consumer spending . historical trends indicate there has been a strong correlation between world-wide gross domestic product levels , consumer spending and semiconductor industry cycles . the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged cyclical downturns in the past . we can not predict the timing , strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery . 37 our net sales , gross profit , operating income , cash flows , liquidity and capital resources have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of many factors , including the seasonality of our business , the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and other factors discussed in part 1 , item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k. our net sales decreased $ 16.8 million or 0.6 % to $ 2,759.5 million in 2012 from $ 2,776.4 million in 2011 . the decrease was driven by a decline of $ 54.7 million or 2.2 % in packaging net sales partially offset by an increase in test net sales of $ 38.0 million or 13.4 % . the decrease in packaging net sales was primarily the result of weakness in the consumer , networking and auto and industrial end markets , partially offset by strength in the communications end market for smartphones and tablets . the increase in test net sales was primarily driven by strength in the communications end market for smartphones and tablets . gross margin for 2012 decreased to 15.4 % from 17.7 % in 2011 . the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to weakness in demand for some of our wirebond packaging services and the corresponding lower level of utilization of these manufacturing assets , the estimated $ 50.0 million loss contingency charge resulting from our pending patent license arbitration with tessera and lower net sales due to insourcing by some of our integrated device manufacturer ( `` idm `` ) customers . the loss contingency charge reduced our gross margin by two percentage points . the decreases were partially offset by increased net sales of flip chip and wafer level packages , as well as increased test net sales supporting mobile communications . we operate in a capital intensive industry and have a significant level of debt . servicing our current and future customers requires that we incur significant operating expenses and continue to make significant capital expenditures , which are generally made in advance of the related revenues and without any firm customer commitments . we fund our operations , including capital expenditures and debt service requirements , with cash flows from operations , existing cash and cash equivalents , borrowings under available credit facilities , and proceeds from any additional financing . maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity is important to our business and depends on , among other things , the performance of our business , our capital expenditure levels and our ability to repay debt out of our operating cash flows or proceeds from debt or equity financings . in 2012 , our capital additions totaled $ 533.2 million or 19.3 % of net sales compared to $ 453.0 million or 16.3 % of net sales in 2011 . our 2012 capital additions were driven by investments in advanced test platforms and packaging equipment supporting the communications end market , as well as research and development projects . in 2012 , 42.2 % of our capital additions were made in packaging , 39.9 % for test and 17.9 % for research and development and infrastructure projects . in 2011 , 60.9 % of our capital additions were made in packaging , 22.5 % for test and 16.6 % for research and development and infrastructure projects . net cash provided by operating activities was $ 389.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , compared to $ 516.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 . we experienced negative free cash flow of $ 144.4 million for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , compared to free cash flow of $ 50.1 million in the prior year . our negative free cash flow was primarily driven by capital purchases to support customer demand for packaging and test services related to mobile communications and an increase in accounts receivable . we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property , plant and equipment . free cash flow is not defined by u.s generally accepted accounting principles ( â€œ u.s . gaap â€ ) , and a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is set forth under the caption â€œ cash flows â€ below . 38 results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_6_th net sales replace_table_token_7_th net sales . story_separator_special_tag based on this assessment , we believe that our cash flow from operating activities , together with existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under our debt facilities , will be sufficient to fund our working capital , capital expenditure and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months . thereafter , our liquidity will continue to be affected by , among other things , volatility in the global economy and credit markets , the performance of our business , our capital expenditure levels , other uses of our cash including the final amount of payments due in our disputes with tessera , any purchases of stock under our stock repurchase program , any investments in joint ventures or acquisitions and our ability to either repay debt out of operating cash flows or proceeds from debt or equity financings . in light of possible investment 44 opportunities , we are exploring additional lines of credit of approximately $ 300 million . there can be no assurance that we will generate the necessary net income or operating cash flows , or be able to borrow sufficient funds , to meet the funding needs of our business beyond the next twelve months due to a variety of factors , including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and other factors discussed in part i , item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k. our primary source of cash and the source of funds for our operations are cash flows from our operations , existing cash and cash equivalents , borrowings under available debt facilities and proceeds from any additional debt or equity financings . as of december 31 , 2012 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $ 413.0 million and availability of $ 149.7 million under our $ 150.0 million first lien senior secured revolving credit facility . additionally , our foreign subsidiaries had $ 80.0 million available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities and $ 100.0 million available to be borrowed under term loans . in 2013 , we borrowed an additional $ 23.0 million under our term loans . net cash provided by operating activities was $ 389.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2012 compared to $ 516.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 . we expect cash flows to be used in the operation and expansion of our business , making capital expenditures , paying principal and interest on our debt and for other corporate purposes . we have a significant amount of indebtedness . total debt at december 31 , 2012 was $ 1,545.0 million . our indebtedness requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay our debt and interest . we refer you to â€œ contractual obligations â€ below for a summary of principal and interest payments . we operate in a capital intensive industry . servicing our current and future customers requires that we incur significant operating expenses and make significant capital expenditures , which are generally made in advance of the related revenues and without any firm customer commitments . we sponsor an accrued severance plan for our korean subsidiary which , under existing tax laws in korea , limits our ability to deduct related severance expenses accrued under that plan . the purpose of these limitations is to encourage companies to migrate to a defined contribution or defined benefit plan . if we retain our existing severance plan , the deduction for severance expenses will be primarily limited to severance payments made to retired employees , which results in a larger current income tax liability in korea . if we decide to adopt a new plan , we may fund a significant portion of the existing liability , which would provide a current tax deduction upon funding . our korean severance liability was $ 126.5 million as of december 31 , 2012 . included in our cash balance as of december 31 , 2012 , is $ 224.1 million held offshore by our foreign subsidiaries . if we were to distribute this offshore cash to the u.s. as repatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries , we would incur up to $ 6.0 million of foreign withholding taxes ; however , we would not incur a significant amount of u.s. federal income taxes , due to the availability of tax loss carryovers and foreign tax credits . our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 300.0 million of our common stock , exclusive of any fees , commissions or other expenses . we did not purchase any stock under the plan for the three months ended december 31 , 2012 . through december 31 , 2012 , we had repurchased 45.0 million shares for $ 208.4 million , net of $ 0.9 million of commissions , leaving a balance of $ 91.6 million available at december 31 , 2012 for stock repurchases under this program . the purchase of stock may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions . the timing , manner , price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by us at our discretion and will depend upon a variety of factors including economic and market conditions , the cash needs and investment opportunities for the business , price , applicable legal requirements and other factors . our stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time . we have a 30 % equity interest and options to acquire additional equity interests in j-devices , a joint venture among amkor , toshiba and the original shareholders of j-devices , which provides semiconductor packaging and test services in japan . the options are exercisable at our discretion and permit us to increase our ownership interest in j-devices . in january 2013 , we exercised our option to increase our ownership interest in j-devices from 30 % to 60 % for an aggregate purchase price

Â· insurance coverage for and relating to commercial properties is increasingly costly and difficult to obtain . in addition , insurance carriers have excluded certain specific items from standard insurance policies , which have resulted in increased risk exposure for the partnership . these include insurance coverage for acts of terrorism and war , and coverage for mold and other environmental conditions . coverage for these items is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive . Â· market interest rates could adversely affect market prices for class a partnership units and depositary receipts as well as performance and cash flow .

the adequacy of disclosures made by the partnership prior to the date hereof or the effectiveness of said act . the partnership expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardâ€‘looking statement , whether as a result of new information , future events or otherwise . since the partnership 's longâ€‘term goals include the acquisition of additional properties , a portion of the proceeds from the refinancing and sale of properties is reserved for this purpose . if available acquisitions do not meet the partnership 's investment criteria , the partnership may purchase additional depositary receipts . the partnership will consider refinancing existing properties if the partnership 's cash reserves are insufficient to repay existing mortgages or if the partnership needs additional funds for future acquisitions . on february 24 , 2019 , harold brown , the owner of 75 % of the outstanding voting securities of newreal inc. , the general partner , of new england realty associates limited partnership passed away . as a result , mr. brown 's estate currently holds voting control over the newreal shares . effective as of february 24 , 2019 , the board of directors of the partnership 's general partner , newreal inc. , 25 elected jameson brown as the director , treasurer and chief financial officer of new real to fill the vacancy created by the death of harold brown , who served as both the treasurer and a director of newreal . during 2018 , rents continued to increase with average increases of 3.6 % for renewals and 4.6 % for new leases . early indications for 2019 are that rents will continue to increase and renewal rents are expected to be in the range of 3-4 % . some softening in the market is starting to show as rental commission increased to $ 460,000 in 2018 from $ 370,000 in 2017 , an increase of $ 90,000 ( 24.3 % ) . in the strongest of rental markets , tenants generally pay the commission expense and as the market cools more of the expense is shifted to the landlord . we will have to see if this is a onetime uptick in commission expense or the beginning of a trend . for 2018 , including purchases of woodland park and hamilton highlands , consolidated revenue increased by 9.8 % , operating expenses increased by 11.4 % and income before other income ( expense ) grew by 5.5 % . excluding the woodland park and hamilton highland acquisitions , same store revenue grew by 4.4 % , operating expenses by 0.7 % and income before other income ( expense ) grew by 13.7 % . for the same reporting period , vacancy was 2.1 % vs 1.7 % . excluding depreciation and amortization , same store revenues ( excluding woodland park and hamilton highlands ) grew by 4.4 % , operating expenses by 3.4 % and net operating income by 5.3 % . management believes similar same store operating results will be achieved for 2019 and that the recent acquisition will result in higher performance . the joint ventures of 1025 hancock and hamilton bay made significant progress in 2018 towards the goal of completely selling out all residential condominium units . each joint venture sold 16 units in 2018 , 1025 hancock has 2 remaining units and hamilton bay has 3 remaining units . story_separator_special_tag factors to be considered by management in its analysis of inâ€‘place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseâ€‘up periods considering current market conditions , and costs to execute similar leases at market rates during the expected leaseâ€‘up periods , depending on local market conditions . in estimating costs to execute similar leases , management considers leasing commissions , legal and other related expenses . characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the partnership 's existing business relationships with the tenant , growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant , the tenant 's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals . the value of inâ€‘ place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases . the value of tenant relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships . in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property may be impaired , an analysis of the value is prepared . the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are compared to the asset 's carrying value to determine if a writeâ€‘down to fair value is required . 29 impairment : on an annual basis management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the partnership 's rental properties may be impaired . a property 's value is impaired only if management 's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows ( undiscounted and without interest charges ) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property . to the extent impairment has occurred , the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property . the partnership 's estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including , among others , demand for space , competition for tenants , changes in market rental rates , and costs to operate each property . as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management 's assumptions , the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved . investments in joint ventures : the partnership accounts for its 40 % â€‘50 % ownership in the investment properties under the equity method of accounting , as it exercises significant influence over , but does not control these entities . these investments are recorded initially at cost , as investments in joint ventures , and subsequently adjusted for the partnership 's share in earnings , cash contributions and distributions . under the equity method of accounting , our net equity is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets , and our share of net income or loss from the partnership is included on the consolidated statements of income . generally , the partnership would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment ( and any advances ) is reduced to zero and would not provide for additional losses unless the partnership has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee . if the venture subsequently generates income , the partnership only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses . the authoritative guidance on consolidation provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ( â€œ variable interest entities â€ or â€œ vies â€ ) and the determination of which business enterprise , if any , should consolidate the vie ( the â€œ primary beneficiary â€ ) . generally , the consideration of whether an entity is a vie applies when either ( 1 ) the equity investors ( if any ) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial

","The partnership faces several challenges that could impact its financial performance and operations. Competition may hinder its ability to attract and retain tenants, potentially lowering rental rates. Environmental liabilities, such as contamination and hazardous materials, pose risks, although management currently reports no material liabilities. Insurance costs for commercial properties are rising, with exclusions for terrorism and environmental conditions increasing risk exposure. Market interest rates could negatively affect the value of Class A partnership units and cash flow. Changes in tax laws may also impact after-tax distributions. The partnership's growth strategy includes acquiring additional properties, but it may struggle to find suitable investments or sell underperforming assets. In 2018, average rent increases were 3.6% for renewals and 4.6% for new leases, with a rental commission rise to $460,000 from $370,000 in 2017 (24.3% increase). Consolidated revenue grew by 9.8%, while operating expenses increased by 11.4%, leading to a 5.5% rise in income before other income (expense). Vacancy rates were 2.1%, up from 1.7%. The partnership's joint ventures sold 16 condominium units each in 2018, with 2 and 3 units remaining at 1025 Hancock and Hamilton Bay, respectively. Management assesses property values annually for impairment, and legal proceedings may arise in the ordinary course of business, often covered by insurance."

accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ( â€œ gaap â€ ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements , and income and expenses during the periods reported . actual results could materially differ from those estimates . the company has identified the following as its critical accounting policies : emerging growth company section 102 ( b ) ( 1 ) of the jobs act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies ( that is , those that have not had a securities act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the exchange act ) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards . the jobs act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable . the company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies , the company , as an emerging growth company , can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard . loss per common share net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period , plus to the extent dilutive the incremental number of shares of common stock to settle warrants , as calculated using the treasury stock method . at november 30 , 2018 and 2017 , the company had outstanding warrants to purchase 14,870,098 shares of common stock . for all periods presented , these shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share of common stock because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive . as a result , diluted loss per common share is the same as basic loss per common share for the period . financial instruments the fair value of the company 's assets and liabilities , which qualify as financial instruments under fasb asc 820 , â€œ fair value measurements and disclosures , â€ approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheets . income taxes the company follows

accumulated deficit of $ 186.0 million . on november 1 , 2017 , we raised approximately $ 7.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of 5,525,000 units ( each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one common warrant to purchase one share of common stock ) and 4,475,000 pre-funded units ( each pre-funded unit consisting of one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock

warrant contained in a unit or pre-funded unit has an exercise price of $ 0.80 per share and is exercisable immediately and will expire five years from the date of issuance . each pre-funded warrant contained in a pre-funded unit was exercisable for one share of common stock and the exercise price was $ 0.01 per share . as of december 31 , 2017 , all of the pre-funded warrants sold in connection with the november 2017 financing had been exercised by the holders of such pre-funded warrants , resulting in net proceeds to us of $ 45,000. these proceeds , however , exclude any amounts that will

financing as the â€œ june 2018 financing â€ . we do not know when , or if , we will generate any revenue from the sale of our product candidates as we seek regulatory approval for , and potentially begin to commercialize , any of our product candidates . story_separator_special_tag as of december 31 , 2018 , we concluded that there would be no adjustments to the transaction price as we continue to not expect any amounts to be received from any milestones within the license agreement . this is due to the nature of the milestones and the development status of the product candidates at the time of the adoption . as a result , no revenue was recognized during the twelve month period ended december 31 , 2018 as all performance obligations had been previously achieved and there was no change in the transaction price during the period . no revenue would have been recognized under 108 the previous accounting literature during the year ended december 31 , 2018 as no milestones were achieved in the period , which was the revenue recognition criteria under the previous accounting literature . accrued research and development expenses as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements , we are required to estimate our accrued expenses . this process involves reviewing quotes and contracts , identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost . the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met . we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time . we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary . the significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses are related to fees paid to cros and cmos and other vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced . we base our expenses related to cros and cmos on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with cros and cmos that conduct research and development on our behalf . the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation , vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows . there may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense . in accruing service fees , we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period . if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate , we adjust the accrual or prepayment expense accordingly . although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred , our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in our reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period . there have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented . stock-based compensation we account for all stock-based compensation payments to employees , directors and non-employees using an option pricing model for estimating fair value . accordingly , stock-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant , and prior to january 1 , 2017 , net of estimated forfeitures . we recognize stock-based compensation expense over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line method . in accordance with authoritative guidance , we remeasure the fair value of non-employee stock-based awards as the awards vest , and recognize the resulting value , if any , as expense during the period the related services are rendered ( a ) . ( a ) for awards with performance conditions , we recognize expense when the condition is probable of achievement , over the implied service period of the award . significant factors , assumptions and methodologies used in determining fair value we apply the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic 718 , compensation-stock compensation , or asc 718. determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date . we recognize stock-based compensation expense for service-based awards ratably over the requisite service period , which in most cases is the vesting period of the award . calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make subjective assumptions . we use the black-scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards . use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock , the expected term of our stock options , the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield . as we have only been a public company since december 2014 , we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock price or the expected life of the options . we calculate expected volatility based on reported data for similar publicly traded companies for which historical information is available and will continue to do so until the historical volatility of our common stock is sufficient to measure expected volatility for future option grants . during the periods we were a privately held company with a limited operating history , we utilized data from a representative group of public companies to estimate expected stock price volatility . we selected companies from the biopharmaceutical industry with similar characteristics to us , including those at a similar stage of development and with a similar therapeutic focus . we use the â€œ simplified method â€
","the company has primarily financed its operations through various means, including private placements of common and preferred stock, convertible bridge notes, venture debt, an IPO, and secondary offerings, totaling significant capital raised over the years. Notably, a license agreement with Roche, initiated on June 10, 2016, provided an upfront fee of $7.5 million and a milestone payment of $22.5 million, with potential additional payments of up to $240 million based on regulatory and commercial milestones. The company has incurred substantial operating losses, reporting a net loss of $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and an accumulated deficit of $186 million by that date. The financing activities included raising approximately $7 million in November 2017 from the sale of 5.5 million units at $0.80 each, and $41.9 million in June 2018 from selling 25.6 million shares at $1.80 each. The company has not yet completed the development of any product candidates and anticipates continued significant expenses and operating losses in the coming years. It holds global rights for its TFPT-based product candidates and plans to explore commercialization strategies upon regulatory approval. The company also utilizes stock-based compensation, measured using the Black-Scholes model, to account for employee and director compensation, with expenses recognized over the requisite service period."

company began 2013 with north american production levels at an annual run-rate of 56 mw . the production rate was increased to 70 mw during the year and the company expanded total capacity by about 11 percent through process improvements to 100 mw annually . the company maintained an annual production run-rate at the torrington , connecticut production facility of approximately 70 mw during the fourth quarter of 2013 , producing 17.5 mw of cell components for fuel cell kits and fuel cell power plants . during 2013 , the company built the 14.0 mw bridgeport fuel cell park with dominion ( nyse : d ) , as project owner . the project was completed on schedule with dominion 's final acceptance on december 20 , 2013 and power is being delivered to the electric grid under a 15 year energy purchase agreement with a connecticut electric utility . the installation consists of five fuel cell power plants and an organic rankine cycle turbine for added output and further efficiency gains , with the power output adequate to power approximately 15,000 average size u.s. homes . the associated service contract , valued at approximately $ 69 million over the 15 year project life , began with dominion 's acceptance . all 21 dfc3000 Â® power plants have been installed at the 59 mw gyeonggi green energy fuel cell park in hwasung city , south korea by posco energy . the project is on schedule and delivering power to the electric grid and steam to a district heating system . the fuel cell park was constructed in only twelve months demonstrated the ability to add a significant level of renewable power near where the power is used in a very short period of time . we believe that the facility is a global showcase for clean baseload electric grid support from fuel cell power plants and a model for other regions of the world . advanced technology update the company continues to develop its solid oxide fuel cell ( sofc ) technology and distributed hydrogen generation capabilities , utilizing global partners to build critical mass and to develop technology platforms suitable for markets around the world . during the fourth quarter of 2013 , the company entered into the following : a $ 6.4 million cost shared cooperative agreement with the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) to demonstrate a sub-megawatt sofc plant configured for combined heat & power ( chp ) output that is connected to the electric grid . a multi-phase two year agreement to supply a demonstration solid-state electrochemical hydrogen separation ( ehs ) unit to a global chemical company for high efficiency separation of hydrogen from natural gas . under the first phase , valued at approximately $ 1.1 million , the company will deliver a remotely monitored ce-compliant ehs system . successful completion of the first phase is expected to lead to subsequent funding to increase the size and scale of the system for the targeted industrial market . the technology provides a unique way to separate hydrogen from natural gas or renewable biogas in a process with relatively low energy consumption and without the need for pressurization or moving parts , leading to lower operating costs than current hydrogen separation technologies . a doe supported project to convert agricultural waste into renewable power utilizing an sofc power plant at a dairy farm in california . the sacramento municipal utility district ( smud ) will facilitate the installation and operation of the sofc power system . 43 results of operations management evaluates the results of operations and cash flows

cost of product sales decreased $ 2.6 million in fiscal year ended october 31 , 2012 to $ 93.9 million , compared to $ 96.5 million in the same period the prior year . gross profit decreased $ 5.4 million to $ 1.1 million in fiscal year 2012 compared to $ 6.5 million in fiscal year 2011 on a mix primarily consisting of fuel cell kits in fiscal year 2012 compared to a higher volume of revenue from complete power plants in fiscal year 2011 which had higher margins . as of october 31 , 2012 our production run-rate was 56 mw . 49 service agreement revenues and cost of revenues service agreement revenues for fiscal year ended october 31 , 2012 totaled $ 18.1 million from service and power purchase agreements , compared to $ 12.1 million for fiscal year 2011 , on an increased number of service agreements as the company 's number of units in the field continues to grow . service agreement cost of revenues decreased to $ 19.0 million from $ 30.8 million in fiscal year 2011. the gross loss on service agreements decreased to $ 0.9 million for fiscal year ended october 31 , 2012 , compared to $ 18.7 million for the comparable prior year period . the improvement in service agreement margins is primarily due to lower stack replacement and routine maintenance costs and increased revenues on new mw class product installations . the loss on service agreements has

","The agreement between FuelCell Energy and NRG Energy aims to enhance order flow through a power purchase agreement model, allowing customers to opt for a pay-as-you-go system where NRG owns the power plant and sells ultra-clean power and high-quality heat. This partnership introduces a new sales channel for FuelCell Energy's power plants, with NRG marketing them to its customer base while FuelCell Energy handles installation, operation, and maintenance. In 2013, FuelCell Energy's North American production run-rate increased from 56 MW to 70 MW, with total capacity rising by 11% to 100 MW annually. The company completed the 14 MW Bridgeport Fuel Cell Park, which powers approximately 15,000 homes, under a 15-year energy purchase agreement valued at $69 million. Additionally, all 21 DFC3000 power plants were installed at the 59 MW Gyeonggi Green Energy Fuel Cell Park in South Korea. Financially, total revenues for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2013, rose by 56% to $187.7 million, while total costs increased by 50% to $180.5 million. The company also entered into a $6.4 million cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy to demonstrate a sub-megawatt solid oxide fuel cell plant and a $1.1 million agreement for a hydrogen separation unit. Overall, the company is focused on expanding its technology and market presence while managing operational costs and improving service agreement margins."

subcontractor costs and grants are passed through to our clients and , in accordance with u.s. gaap and industry practice , are included in our revenue when it is our contractual responsibility to procure or manage these activities . because subcontractor services can vary significantly from project to project and period to period , changes in revenue may not necessarily be indicative of our

related to california wildfires . in addition , our fiscal 2019 results included a reduction of revenue of $ 13.7 million from a claim that was resolved last year . excluding the disposal , the

exclude the rcm results and certain non-operating accounting-related adjustments , such as acquisition and integration costs , gains/losses from adjustments to contingent considerations , goodwill

pipeline activities that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and subsequent related gains from non-core equipment 38 disposals in fiscal 2020. our fiscal 2019 adjusted results exclude a charge to operating income of $ 13.7 million from a claim that was resolved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 for a remediation project , where the work was substantially performed in prior years . the effective tax rates applied to these adjustments to earnings per share ( `` eps `` ) to arrive at adjusted eps averaged 155 % and 16 % in fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively . the goodwill impairment charges in both fiscal years and certain of the transaction charges in fiscal 2019 did not have related tax benefits . excluding these items , the effective tax rates applied to the

occur . both eps and adjusted eps were calculated using diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding for the respective periods as reflected in our consolidated statements of income . during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 , we took actions in response to the covid-19 pandemic to ensure the health and safety of our employees , clients , and communities . these actions included activating our business continuity plan globally , which enabled 95 % of our workforce to work remotely and all 450 of our global offices to remain operational supporting our clients ' programs and projects .

21 % effective january 1 , 2018 , while also repealing the deduction for domestic production activities , limiting the deductibility of certain executive compensation , and implementing a modified territorial tax system with the introduction of the global intangible low-taxed income ( `` gilti `` ) tax rules . the tcja also imposed a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical

differences . excluding the net deferred tax benefits from the tcja and the release of the valuation allowance , our effective tax rate was 21.9 % in fiscal 2019 compared to 25.1 % in fiscal 2018 ; the reduction is primarily due to the reduced u.s. corporate income tax rate . with respect to the gilti provisions of the tcja , we had analyzed our structure and global results of operations and

inflation has remained relatively low during 2020 and 2019. the impact of rising operating expenses due to inflation on the operating performance of the company 's portfolio would have been mitigated by terms in substantially all of the company 's leases , which contain provisions designed to increase revenues to offset the adverse impact of inflation on the company 's results of operations . these provisions include upward periodic adjustments in base rent due from tenants , usually based on a stipulated increase , and , to a lesser extent , on the change in the consumer price index , commonly referred to as the cpi . in addition , substantially all of the company 's properties are leased to tenants under long-term leases , which provide for reimbursement of operating expenses by

and determine our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures . ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income , operating income , cash flows from operating activities , or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap . our ebitda may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled financial metrics of other entities , as other entities may not calculate ebitda in the same manner as we do . management compensates for the limitations of ebitda as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measures , understanding the differences between the measures , and incorporating this knowledge into management 's decision-making processes . ebitda should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount we have available for distributions or that we plan to distribute for a given period , nor should it be equated with â€œ available cash â€ as defined in our partnership agreement . the following table reconciles net income to ebitda for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_4_th 33 the following table reconciles cash flow from operating activities to ebitda for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_5_th average utilization rate of our compressor units . we measure the average compressor unit utilization rate of our fleet of compressor units as the average number of compressor units used to provide services during a particular period , divided by the average number of compressor units in our fleet during such period . our management primarily uses this metric to determine our future need for additional compressor units . the following table sets forth our historical fleet size and average number of compressor units being utilized to provide our production enhancement services during the periods indicated and our average utilization rates during those periods . replace_table_token_6_th ( 1 ) â€œ average number of compressor units in service â€ for each period shown is determined by calculating an average of two numbers , the first of which is the number of compressor units being used to provide services at the beginning of the period and the second of which is the number of compressor units being used to provide services at the end of the period . ( 2 ) â€œ average compressor unit utilization â€ for each period shown is determined by dividing the average number of compressor units in service during such period by the average of two numbers , the first of which is the total number of compressor units in our fleet at the beginning of such period and the second of which is the total number of compressor units in our fleet at the end of such period . net increase in compressor fleet size . we define the net increase in our compressor fleet size during a given period of time as the difference between the number of compressor units we placed into service , less the number of compressor units we removed from service . management uses this metric to evaluate our operating performance and specifically the effectiveness of our marketing efforts . story_separator_special_tag consolidated cost of compression and other services as a percentage of consolidated compression and other services revenues decreased slightly to 51.2 % during 2012 from 51.3 % during 2011. during 2012 , we successfully took steps to reduce many of our operating costs domestically and we continue to look for opportunities for additional cost reductions both domestically and internationally . this decrease in cost of services as a percentage of service revenues was despite the contractually fixed margins on 2012 eps work in argentina performed on tetra 's behalf , particularly in the fourth quarter . our domestic cost savings were additionally offset by increased costs related to wage increases , as well as higher fuel prices . cost of compressors and parts sales decreased by $ 5.9 million during the year ended december 31 , 2012 , to $ 3.7 million compared to $ 9.6 million during the year ended december 31 , 2011 , as a result of decreased domestic compressor sales . selling , general , and administrative expense selling , general , and administrative expense increased to $ 18.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , from $ 15.8 million for 2011. as a percentage of consolidated revenues , our selling , general , and administrative expense increased during the year ended december 31 , 2012 , to 17.3 % compared to 16.6 % for the prior year . the increase in current year expense is primarily due to the additional administrative cost of being a public limited partnership following the june 2011 offering and consists of increased salary and employee-related expenses associated with increased administrative staff and increased professional fees . additionally , equity compensation expense increased as a result of increased current year equity grants , the impact of a severance agreement , and increased incentive compensation as a result of our favorable overall financial results . these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense . professional fee expenses are typically highest during the first and fourth quarters of each year , due to the annual legal , financial , and tax reporting requirements associated with being a publicly traded limited partnership . selling , general , and administrative expense following the june 2011 offering includes costs charged by tetra for administrative costs under the omnibus agreement . 39 depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense primarily consists of the depreciation of compressor units . in addition , depreciation and amortization expense also includes the depreciation of other operating equipment and facilities locations , as well as the amortization of certain intangible assets . primarily as a result of additional units placed into service to meet increased demand in latin america , depreciation and amortization expense increased $ 0.7 million to $ 13.2 million during the year ended december 31 , 2012 , compared to $ 12.5 million for the prior year . interest expense , net a significant amount of interest expense was reflected in the prior year period results of our predecessor due to a note payable to an affiliate of tetra . we assumed approximately $ 32.2 million of this indebtedness ( as partial consideration for the assets that were contributed from tetra in connection with the offering ) , and this $ 32.2 million balance was repaid in full from the proceeds of the offering . during the second half of 2012 , we borrowed a total of $ 10.1 million pursuant to our credit agreement ( the credit agreement ) , and that amount was outstanding as of december 31 , 2012 . we incurred $ 80,000 in interest expense in the current year associated with this borrowing . other expense , net other expense , net , decreased by $ 0.1 million during the year ended december 31 , 2012 , compared to the prior year , primarily due to decreased foreign currency exchange net losses in 2012 from currency fluctuations . current year foreign exchange losses primarily relate to our mexican operations . income before taxes , provision for income taxes , and net income income before taxes for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , was $ 19.7 million , compared to $ 9.2 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 , an increase of $ 10.5 million . as a percentage of consolidated total revenues , income before taxes increased to 18.1 % for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , compared to 9.6 % for the prior year . our operations are not subject to u.s. federal income tax other than with respect to the operations that are conducted through our taxable u.s. corporate subsidiary , resulting in a lower effective tax rate compared to the prior year period operations of our predecessor . we also incur state and local income taxes in certain states , and we incur income taxes related to our operations in latin america and canada . net income for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , increased $ 9.1 million compared to the prior year . as described above , our profitability increased due to increased revenues , primarily internationally , and decreased interest expense . 2011 compared to 2010 revenues our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 , 2011 , increased 16.9 % to $ 95.2 million from $ 81.4 million for the year ended december 31 , 2010. this change was primarily associated with a 228.6 % increase in revenues from sales of compressor units and parts , which increased from $ 4.0 million during the year ended december 31 , 2010 , to $ 13.2 million during the year ended december 31 , 2011. this increase was primarily due to sales of compressor units to two specific customers . although sales of compressor units are a typical part of our operations , the level of revenues from sales of compressors is volatile and more difficult to forecast compared to our compression services
","As of December 31, 2012, the company experienced significant growth in its operations, particularly in Latin America, which necessitated investments in fixed assets and working capital, leading to increased personnel and administrative services. Operating expenses, a key performance measure, were primarily driven by labor costs, repair and maintenance, and fuel, with total operating expenses fluctuating based on activity levels. EBITDA, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, was closely monitored, reflecting the company's ability to generate cash for distributions and assess financial performance. The average utilization rate of compressor units was tracked to determine future needs, with a slight decrease in the consolidated cost of compression services as a percentage of revenues from 51.3% in 2011 to 51.2% in 2012. Selling, general, and administrative expenses rose to $18.8 million in 2012 from $15.8 million in 2011, largely due to increased administrative costs following a public offering. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $13.2 million, reflecting additional units placed into service. Income before taxes surged to $19.7 million in 2012, up from $9.2 million in 2011, with net income increasing by $9.1 million, attributed to higher revenues and reduced interest expenses. Consolidated revenues for 2011 reached $95.2 million, a 16.9% increase from $81.4 million in 2010, driven by a 228.6% rise in compressor unit sales from $4.0 million to $13.2 million."
93,"such estimates are based upon many assumptions and judgments , including ( i ) market rates of return and capitalization rates on real estate and intangible assets , ( ii ) building and material cost levels , ( iii ) comparisons of the acquired underlying land parcels to recent land 25 transactions , and ( iv ) future cash flows from the real estate and the existing tenant base . others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values , which would result in different depreciation and amortization expense , gains and losses on sale of real estate assets , and real estate and intangible assets . overview our self-storage operations generate most of our net income , and we believe that our earnings growth is most impacted by the level of organic growth in our existing self-storage portfolio . accordingly , a significant portion of management 's time is devoted to maximizing cash flows from our existing self-storage facilities . most of our facilities compete with other well-managed and well-located competitors and we are subject to general economic conditions , particularly those that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends . we believe that our centralized information networks , national telephone and online reservation system , the brand name â€œ public storage , â€ and our economies of scale enable us to meet such challenges effectively . in the last three years , there has been a marked increase in development of new self-storage facilities in many of the markets we operate in , due to the favorable economics of development which we have also taken advantage of . these newly developed facilities compete with many of the facilities we own , negatively impacting our occupancies , rental rates , and rental growth . this increase in supply has been most notable in atlanta , austin , charlotte , chicago , dallas , denver , houston , new york , and portland . we plan on growing organically as well as through the acquisition and development of new facilities and expanding our existing self-storage facilities . since the beginning of 2013 through december 31 , 2018 , we acquired a total of 296 facilities with 20.6 million net rentable square feet from third parties for approximately $ 2 . 7 billion , and we opened newly developed and expanded self-storage space for a total cost of $ 1.2 billion , adding approximately 1 1.3 million net rentable square feet . subsequent to december 31 , 2018 , we acquired or were under contract to acquire ( subject to customary closing conditions ) 14 self-storage facilities for $ 102.4 million . we will continue to seek to acquire properties ; however , there is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance as to the level of facilities we may acquire . as of december 31 , 2018 , we had additional development and redevelopment projects to build approximately 5 .2 million net rentable square feet at a total cost of approximately $ 607 .4 million . we expect to continue to seek additional development projects ; however , the level of such activity may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding available sites that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations , as well as challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities . we believe that our development and redevelopment activities are beneficial to our business over the long run . however , in the short run , such activities dilute our earnings due to the three to four year period that it takes to fill up newly developed and redeveloped storage facilities and reach a stabilized level of cash flows offset by the cost of capital to fund the cost , combined with related overhead expenses flowing through general and administrative expense . we believe the level of dilution incurred in 2018 will continue at similar levels in 2019 and beyond , assuming realization of our current expectation of maintaining our current level of development for the foreseeable future . on july 13 , 2018 , we received a cash distribution from shurgard self storage sa ( â€œ shurgard europe â€ ) totaling $ 145.4 million . on september 18 , 2017 , we completed a public offering of $ 1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in two equal tranches ( collectively , the â€œ u.s . dollar notes â€ ) , one maturing in september 2022 bearing interest at 2.370 % , and another maturing in september 2027 bearing interest at 3.094 % . this was our first public offering of debt , which should also serve to facilitate future offerings . 26 on october 15 , 2018 , shurgard europe completed an initial global offering ( the â€œ offering â€ ) of its common shares , and its shares commenced trading on euronext brussels under the â€œ shur â€ symbol . in the offering , shurgard europe issued 25.0 million of its common shares to third parties at a price of 23 per share , for 575 million in gross proceeds . the gross proceeds were used to repay short-term borrowings , invest in real estate assets , and for other corporate purposes . our equity interest , comprised of a direct and indirect pro-rata ownership interest in 31.3 million shares , decreased from 49 % to 3 5 . 2 % as a result of the offer ing . while we did not sell any of our shares in the offering , we did record a g ain on disposition in 2018 of $ 151.6 million , as if we had sold a proportionate share of our investment in shurgard europe . see â€œ investment in shurgard europe â€ below for more information . story_separator_special_tag we ended 2016 with aggregate annualized contract rents per occupied foot up 4.7 % on a year over year basis . th e year over year increase dropped to 3.1 % at the end of 2017 and 1.3 % at the end of 2018 . 33 the decreases in year over year growth in annual contract rent from 4.7 % at the end of 2016 to 3.1 % at the end of 2017 and to 1.3 % at the end of 2018 was due to increased rent â€œ roll down â€ on tenants moving out relative to the rates of move-ins , particularly with respect to 2018 with reduced move-in rates . however , in 2018 , our customer trends resulted in fewer move-outs and an increased average length of stay . the increased average length of stay contributed to an increased beneficial effect of rent increases to existing tenants in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to more long-term customers that were eligible for rate increases . the extent to which these positive trends will continue in 2019 is uncertain at this time . in order to stimulate move-in volume , we often give promotional discounts , generally in the form of a â€œ $ 1.00 rent for the first month â€ offer . promotional discounts , based upon the move-in contractual rates for the related promotional period , totaled $ 77.8 million , $ 82.4 million and $ 87.6 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , and are recorded as a reduction to revenue . the decreases in promotional discounts in 2017 and 2018 are due to reductions in the volume of move-ins as well as in the case of 2018 , lower average move-in rates . promotional discounts totaled $ 19.8 million and $ 19.9 million for the three months ended december 31 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively . demand is higher in the summer months than in the winter months and , as a result , rental rates charged to new tenants are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter months . demand fluctuates due to various local and regional factors , including the overall economy . demand into our system is also impacted by new supply of self-storage space as well as alternatives to self-storage . we believe rental growth in 201 9 will come primarily from continued annual rent increases to existing tenants . our future rental growth will also be dependent upon many factors for each market that we operate in , including demand for self-storage space , the level of new supply of self-storage space and the average length of stay of our tenants . we believe that the current trends in move-in , move-out , in place contractual rents and occupancy levels are consistent with continued moderate revenue growth in 2019. however , there can be no assurance of continued revenue growth , because current trends , when viewed in the short-run , are volatile and not necessarily predictive of our revenues going forward because they are subject to many factors which can not be predicted , such as the level of consumer demand and competition from newly developed and existing facilities . we are taking a number of actions to improve demand into our system , including ( i ) increasing marke ting spend on the internet , ( ii ) offering competitive rental rates and ( iii ) continuing to offer promotional discounts to new tenants . even if these actions are successful in improving demand into our system , in at least the near term , we believe these actions may have a negative impact on our revenue trends due to less growth in initial rental rates and increased promotional discounts . analysis of same store cost of operations cost of operations ( excluding depreciation and amortization ) increased 3.2 % in 2 018 as compared to 2017 , and 3.4 % in 2017 as compared to 2016 , due primarily to increased property tax expense . property tax expense increased 5.3 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 , and 4.0 % in 2017 as compared to 2016 , due primarily to higher assessed values . we expect property tax expense growth of approximately 5.0 % in 2019 due primarily to higher assessed values and , to a lesser extent , increased tax rates . on-site property manager payroll expense increased 1.1 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 and 0.9 % in 2017 as compared to 2016. these increases were due to higher wage rates , offset partially by lower hours worked . we expect on-site property manager payroll expense to increase on an inflationary basis in 201 9. we have been impacted by a tight labor market across the country , as well as increases in minimum wages in certain jurisdictions , and expect additional impacts in 2019 as existing minimu m wage increases become effective and new increases are enacted . supervisory payroll expense , which represents compensation paid to the management personnel who directly and indirectly supervise the on-site property managers , decreased 7.6 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 and increased 34 2.8 % in 2017 as compared to 2016 . the decrease in 2018 is due to reductions in headcount offset by higher wage rates . the increase in 2017 is due pr imarily to higher wage rates . we expect inflationary increases in wage rates and increased headcount in 2019. repairs and maintenance expense decreased 0.5 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 and increased 4.7 % in 2017 as compared to 2016. repair and maintenance costs include snow removal expense totaling $ 3.5 million , $ 3.0 million and $ 4.2 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . excluding snow removal costs , repairs and maintenance decreased 1.7 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 and increased 8.3 % in 2017 as compared to 2016. repairs and maintenance
","The self-storage operations primarily drive net income, with a focus on organic growth from existing facilities. From 2013 to December 31, 2018, the company acquired 296 facilities for approximately $2.7 billion, adding 20.6 million net rentable square feet, and opened new storage space costing $1.2 billion, contributing 1.3 million square feet. As of December 31, 2018, 14 additional facilities were under contract for $102.4 million, with ongoing development projects for 5.2 million square feet at a cost of $607.4 million. However, increased competition from new facilities in markets like Atlanta and Chicago has negatively impacted occupancy and rental rates. The company reported promotional discounts of $77.8 million in 2018, down from $87.6 million in 2016, reflecting reduced move-in rates. Contract rents per occupied foot grew 4.7% in 2016 but fell to 1.3% by 2018. Operating costs rose 3.2% in 2018, driven by a 5.3% increase in property tax expenses. The company anticipates continued property tax growth of about 5% in 2019, alongside inflationary increases in payroll expenses due to a tight labor market. In 2018, the company received a $145.4 million cash distribution from Shurgard Self Storage and completed a $1 billion public offering of unsecured notes. Despite these challenges, the company aims to enhance demand through increased marketing and competitive pricing, although this may initially dilute revenue growth."
94,"to date , a large portion of our resources with zedge premium have been dedicated to homepage design and promotion needed for marketing lift and rewarded paywall and zedge credit , our closed virtual currency , sales for revenue optimization . we still have material work that is needed to achieve these goals . over time , we expect that zedge premium will contribute to a virtuous cycle whereby it drives new consumers into our zedge app resulting in more artist payouts , which in turn makes the platform more attractive for artists and brands looking to expand their reach and increase their income . in september of 2017 , we closed a transaction with freeform development , inc. , or freeform , and retained their development personnel in order to accelerate the launch and development of zedge premium . in january 2019 , we started testing an option by which our zedge app 's users can remove unsolicited advertisements from our zedge app by paying a fee . as of july 31 , 2019 , we amassed 129,000 active â€˜ ad-free ' subscribers . in fiscal 2020 , we hope to further optimize the offer based on user type , geography and price point as well as introduce new subscription enhancements like content bundles and rewards . we believe that our zedge app 's popularity stems from its ability to provide users with a rich array of relevant digital content in a fun , intuitive and user-friendly fashion that aligns with their interest in expressing their essence in a bespoke manner . to this end , we invest heavily in both product design and development and the underlying technology required to satisfy both our zedge app 's users ' and content contributors ' expectations . as of july 31 , 2019 , approximately 54 % of our zedge app 's user base was located in north america and europe , evenly split between the regions . over the past several years , we have experienced a shift in our regional customer make-up with mau increasing in emerging markets and decreasing in well-developed markets . in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 , users in emerging markets grew by 8.2 % while users in well-developed economies declined 18.3 % when compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. this shift has negatively impacted revenue generation because well-developed markets command materially higher advertising rates when compared to those in emerging markets . mau growth is tightly coupled with securing new users . historically , our high ranking in the google play store has been one of the primary drivers for securing new users . although still an important factor , we have started dedicating resources to growth initiatives , both organic and paid . with time , we believe that we can change our growth dynamic in well-developed markets . aside from formal growth initiatives , we need to continually improve the core user experience test different mechanisms and content verticals that may spur growth and capitalize on the role that zedge premium artists can have on driving new users into the platform . historically , we have generated approximately 90 % of our revenues from selling our zedge app 's advertising inventory to advertising networks , advertising exchanges , and direct arrangements with advertisers . advertising networks and advertising exchanges are third-party technology platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of media advertising inventory from multiple ad networks . the price of advertising inventory is fixed on an advertising network whereas the price for inventory is determined through real-time bidding on an advertising exchange . advertisers are attracted to our zedge app because of its sizable user base . the remainder of our revenues were primarily generated from managing and optimizing the advertising inventory of a third-party mobile application publisher , as well as overseeing the billing , collections and reporting related to advertising for this publisher . the agreement with this mobile application publisher was terminated effective may 31 , 2019 , and we are no longer providing these services . 24 zedge premium is our marketplace in the zedge app where artists and brands can market , distribute and sell their digital content to our users . the content owner sets the price and the end user can purchase the content by paying for it with zedge credits , our closed virtual currency . a user can earn zedge credits when taking specific actions such as watching rewarded videos or completing electronic surveys . alternatively , users can buy zedge credits via an in-app purchase . if a user purchases zedge credits , google play or itunes keeps 30 % of the purchase price with the remaining 70 % being paid to us . when a user purchases zedge premium content the artist or brand receives 70 % of the actual value of the zedge credits used to buy the content item and we retain the remaining 30 % as our fee , which we recognize as other revenue . some of the zedge premium content is available for print-on-demand on merchandise . when a user purchases a print-on-demand item , the artist or brand is paid 70 % of the net profit , after accounting for cost-of-goods sold , shipping and handling , credit card processing and related costs , and we recognize other revenue from the remaining 30 % . as zedge premium matures and expands , we expect it to also diversify our revenue mix . in january 2019 , we started testing a subscription-based product on android , whereby users of our zedge app could prepay a monthly or yearly fee to remove unsolicited ads when using our zedge app . the initial results were positive and , in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 , we scaled the offering for our entire android user base . story_separator_special_tag . in fiscal 2018 , gtv and net revenue generated from zedge premium were $ 42,000 and $ 16,000 respectively . in january 2019 , we started offering an option by which users can remove unsolicited advertisements from our zedge app by paying a fee ( â€œ ad free â€ ) . although still in its early stage , we were able to generate $ 516,000 in gross prepaid subscription sales consisting of both monthly and yearly subscription in the six months ended july 31 , 2019. we recognize subscription revenue on a daily ratable basis over the subscription period and recorded $ 155,000 in net subscription revenue in the same six-month period . we had close to 129,000 active subscription accounts as of july 31 , 2019. we expect to generate more revenue per user from subscriptions than from an advertising-based offering . we continue to focus on topline growth strategy by testing new monetization drivers including a variety of ad units , merchandising , coin sales as well as certain growth initiatives such as new content vertical in our app and or new app . 28 our install count , that is the number of times the zedge app has been installed on devices , increased to 395.9 million at july 31 , 2019 from 336.3 million a year prior . direct cost of revenues . direct cost of revenues decreased 9.2 % in fiscal 2019 to $ 1.4 million from $ 1.5 million in fiscal 2018 , primarily attributable to the redesign of our backend infrastructure . as a percentage of revenue , direct costs in fiscal 2019 were higher at 15.6 % as compared to 14.0 % in fiscal 2018 due to the decline in revenue in fiscal 2019. selling , general and administrative expense . selling , general and administrative expense ( â€œ sg & a â€ ) consists mainly of payroll , benefits , recruiting fees , facilities , marketing , content acquisition and consulting , professional fees , software licensing ( â€œ saas â€ ) and public company related expenses . sg & a expenses decreased 7.1 % in fiscal 2019 to $ 8.9 million from $ 9.6 million in fiscal 2018. this decrease was mostly attributable to the $ 440,000 expenses incurred in connection with the freeform acquihire and severance costs of $ 372,000 associated with the workforce reduction implemented in fiscal 2018. the strong u.s. dollar in fiscal 2019 also served to reduce our sg & a in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018 given that the majority of our employees are based in norway and lithuania . higher marketing expenses for the ad free subscriptions and zedge premium in fiscal 2019 as well as the costs and expenses related to the development of zedge premium in fiscal 2019 partially offset the sg & a expense reduction mentioned above . our headcount totaled 53 as of july 31 , 2019 compared to 57 as of july 31 , 2018 , primarily resulting from the workforce reduction and organic staff attrition in norway and u.s. , offset by the 12 new hires in lithuania during fiscal 2019. as part of the restructuring announced in may 2019 , total headcount is expected to further decline to 45 by september 1 , 2019 when the final severance payments are made . selling , general and administrative expense included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $ 499,000 and $ 413,000 in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively . we also opted to use class b common stock to pay a portion of our board of directors ' compensation and to fund 401 ( k ) matching contributions $ 119,000 and $ 182,000 in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively . see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation . depreciation and amortization . depreciation and amortization expense consists mainly of amortization of capitalized software and technology development costs of our

other major currencies in the world during fiscal 2019. provision for income taxes . the decrease in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the increase in valuation allowance to provide 100 % valuation allowance on all of our u.s. and foreign deferred tax assets in fiscal 2018 , as we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized given the operating losses incurred over the last three years . on december 22 , 2017 , the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act ( the â€œ tax act â€ ) . the tax act made broad and significant changes to the u.s. tax code that affects the year
","Zedge has focused significant resources on enhancing its homepage design and marketing strategies to boost Zedge Premium, a service that allows users to access ad-free experiences and utilize Zedge Credits, a virtual currency. Since the launch of Zedge Premium, the company has seen a growth in active ad-free subscribers, reaching 129,000 by July 31, 2019, and generating $516,000 in gross prepaid subscription sales in the first half of fiscal 2019. The app's install count increased to 395.9 million from 336.3 million year-over-year. However, the company has faced challenges, including a shift in user demographics, with a 8.2% increase in users from emerging markets contrasted by an 18.3% decline in well-developed markets, which typically yield higher advertising rates. In fiscal 2019, Zedge reported a net revenue of $155,000 from subscriptions, while advertising still accounted for approximately 90% of total revenue. The company has also seen a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses, down to $8.9 million from $9.6 million in fiscal 2018, partly due to workforce reductions. Despite these challenges, Zedge continues to invest in product development and marketing to enhance user experience and drive growth, particularly in well-developed markets."

uncertainties . if the expectations or assumptions underlying the company 's forward-looking statements prove inaccurate or if risks or uncertainties arise , actual results could differ materially from those predicted in any forward-looking statements . the factors identified above are believed to be some , but not all , of the important factors that could cause actual events and results to be significantly different from those that may be expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements . 34 overview a. general the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year fluctuations due to the effect of competition on pricing , the frequency and severity of losses , the effect of weather and natural disasters on losses , general economic conditions , the general regulatory environment in states in which an insurer operates , state regulation of premium rates , changes in fair value of investments , and other factors such as changes in tax laws . the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical , with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity . these cycles can have a large impact on the company 's ability to grow and retain business . the company is headquartered in los angeles , california and operates primarily as a personal automobile insurer selling policies through a network of independent agents in thirteen states . the company also offers homeowners , commercial automobile and property , mechanical breakdown , fire , and umbrella insurance . private passenger automobile lines of insurance accounted for 81.6 % of the $ 2.6 billion of the company 's direct premiums written in 2011 . 76.7 % of the private passenger automobile premiums were written in california . the company operates primarily in california , the only state in which it operated prior to 1990. the company has since expanded its operations into the following states : georgia and illinois ( 1990 ) , oklahoma and texas ( 1996 ) , florida ( 1998 ) , virginia and new york ( 2001 ) , new jersey ( 2003 ) , and arizona , pennsylvania , michigan , and nevada ( 2004 ) . the company expects to continue its growth by expanding into new states in future years with the objective of achieving greater geographic diversification . there are challenges and risks involved in entering each new state , including establishing adequate rates without any operating history in the state , working with a new regulatory regime , hiring and training competent personnel , building adequate systems , and finding qualified agents to represent the company . the company does not expect to enter into any new states during 2012. this section discusses some of the relevant factors that management considers in evaluating the company 's performance , prospects , and risks . it is not all-inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of management 's discussion and analysis , the company 's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto , and all other items contained within this annual report on form 10-k. 2011 financial performance summary the company 's net income for the year ended december 31 , 2011 increased to $ 191.2 million , or $ 3.49 per diluted share , from $ 152.2 million , or $ 2.78 per diluted share , for the same period in 2010. approximately $ 141 million in pre-tax investment income was generated during 2011 on a portfolio of approximately $ 3.1 billion at fair value at december 31 , 2011 , compared to $ 144 million pre-tax investment income during 2010 on a portfolio of approximately $ 3.2 billion at fair value at december 31 , 2010. included in net income are net realized investment gains of $ 58.4 million and $ 57.1 million in 2011 and 2010 , respectively . net realized investment gains include gains of $ 31.3 million and $ 46.6 million in 2011 and 2010 , respectively , due to changes in the fair value of total investments pursuant to application of the fair value accounting option . during 2011 , the company continued its marketing efforts to enhance name recognition and lead generation . the company believes that its marketing efforts , combined with its ability to maintain relatively low prices and a strong reputation , make the company very competitive in california and in other states . the company believes its thorough underwriting process gives it an advantage over competitors . the company views its agent relationships and underwriting process as one of its primary competitive advantages because it allows the company to charge lower rates yet realize better margins than many competitors . 35 the company 's operating results and growth have allowed it to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations , which was approximately $ 159 million and $ 92 million in 2011 and 2010 , respectively . cash flow from operations has been used to pay shareholder dividends , retire debt , and help support growth . economic and industry wide factors regulatory uncertainty Â—the insurance industry is subject to strict state regulation and oversight and is governed by the laws of each state in which each insurance company operates . state regulators generally have substantial power and authority over insurance companies including , in some states , approving rate changes and rating factors , and establishing minimum capital and surplus requirements . in many states , insurance commissioners may emphasize different agendas or interpret existing regulations differently than previous commissioners . the company has a successful track record of working with difficult regulations and new insurance commissioners . story_separator_special_tag the claim count development method analyzes historical claim count development to estimate future incurred claim count development for current claims . the company applies these development factors against current claim counts by accident period to calculate ultimate expected claim counts . the paid loss development method analyzes historical payment patterns to estimate the amount of losses yet to be paid . the company uses this method for losses and loss adjustment expenses . the company analyzes catastrophe losses separately from non-catastrophe losses . for catastrophe losses , the company determines claim counts based on claims reported and development expectations from previous catastrophes and applies an average expected loss per claim based on reserves established by adjusters and average losses on previous similar catastrophes . there are many factors that can cause variability between the ultimate expected loss and the actual developed loss . while there are certainly other factors , the company believes that the following three items tend to create the most variability between expected losses and actual losses . ( 1 ) inflation for the company 's california automobile lines of business , total reserves are comprised of the following : bi reservesÂ—approximately 60 % of total reserves material damage ( md ) reserves , including collision and comprehensive property damageÂ—approximately 20 % of total reserves loss adjustment expenses reservesÂ—approximately 20 % of total reserves . loss development on md reserves is generally insignificant because md claims are generally settled in a shorter period than bi reserves . the majority of the loss adjustment expenses reserves are estimated costs to defend bi claims , which tend to require longer periods of time to settle as compared to md claims . bi loss reserves are generally the most difficult to estimate because they take longer to close than other coverages . bi coverage in the company 's policies includes injuries sustained by any person other than the insured , except in the case of uninsured or underinsured motorist bi coverage , which covers damages to the insured for bi caused by uninsured or underinsured motorists . bi payments are primarily for medical costs and general damages . the following table presents the typical closure patterns of bi claims in the california automobile insurance coverage : replace_table_token_16_th bi claims closed in the accident year reported are generally the smaller and less complex claims that settle for approximately $ 2,500 to $ 3,000 , on average , whereas the total average settlement , once all claims are closed in a particular accident year , is approximately $ 7,500 to $ 9,000. the company creates incurred and paid loss triangles to estimate ultimate losses utilizing historical payment and reserving patterns and evaluates the results of this analysis against its frequency and severity analysis to establish bi reserves . the company adjusts development factors to account for inflation trends it sees in loss severity . as a larger proportion of claims from an accident year are settled , there becomes a higher degree of certainty for the reserves established for that 40 accident year . consequently , there is a decreasing likelihood of reserve development on any particular accident year , as those periods age . at december 31 , 2011 , the company believes that the accident years that are most likely to develop are the 2009 through 2011 accident years ; however , it is possible that older accident years could develop as well . in general , the company expects that historical claims trends will continue with costs tending to increase , which is generally consistent with historical data , and therefore the company believes that it is more reasonable to expect inflation than deflation . many potential factors can affect the bi inflation rate , including changes in : claims handling process , statutes and regulations , the number of litigated files , general economic factors , timeliness of claims adjudication , vehicle safety , weather patterns , and gasoline prices , among other factors ; however , the magnitude of such impact on the inflation rate is unknown . it is a common practice in the insurance industry for companies to provide small settlement offers at the inception of a claim to bi claimants who have minor injuries . these claims are settled quickly , reducing the likelihood that bi claimants require larger settlements later on . it also results in some claimants receiving payments that would not have received any payments if an extended adjudication of the claim had occurred . when a large percentage of the total claims are small dollar value claims resulting from this practice , it has the effect of lowering the total average cost for all claims ( severity ) but increasing the total number of claims ( frequency ) . mercury has historically used this approach to handle its bi claims . beginning late in 2008 and continuing through the end of 2009 , the company changed its claims handling procedures and discontinued the practice of providing small settlement offers to bi claimants at the inception of the claim . this had the effect of increasing loss severity and decreasing loss frequency for the 2009 accident year . the prior practice was reinstated in 2010 , which resulted in decreased loss severity and increased loss frequency in 2010 compared to 2009. in 2011 , the practice continued with even greater emphasis on settling small claims quickly . as a result , the loss severity comparisons from 2008 through 2011 are impacted , with 2009 showing much higher severities than had been the trend and 2011 and 2010 showing negative inflation trends when compared to 2010 and 2009. consequently , the company believes that inflation trend comparison between 2011 and 2008 , when the same claims handling process was practiced , is more indicative of the actual severity trend . this comparison indicates an annualized inflation trend of 2.4 % . the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the california
","Investors should recognize that predicting all risks and uncertainties is impossible, and the factors influencing a company's forward-looking statements may lead to actual results differing significantly from expectations. The property and casualty insurance industry is notably cyclical, with fluctuations in premium rates and underwriting capacity affecting growth and retention. The company, headquartered in Los Angeles, primarily operates as a personal automobile insurer across thirteen states, with private passenger automobile insurance constituting 81.6% of its $2.6 billion direct premiums written in 2011, predominantly in California (76.7%). The company has expanded into several states since 1990 and aims for further geographic diversification, although it does not plan to enter new states in 2012. In 2011, net income rose to $191.2 million ($3.49 per diluted share) from $152.2 million ($2.78 per diluted share) in 2010, with pre-tax investment income of approximately $141 million on a $3.1 billion portfolio. The company generated positive cash flow from operations of $159 million in 2011, up from $92 million in 2010, which has been utilized for dividends, debt retirement, and growth. The companyâ€™s reserves are primarily allocated to bodily injury (60%), material damage (20%), and loss adjustment expenses (20%). The average settlement for closed bodily injury claims is approximately $7,500 to $9,000, with a noted annualized inflation trend of 2.4%. The companyâ€™s claims handling practices have evolved, impacting loss severity and frequency, particularly between 2008 and 2011. Overall, the company maintains a competitive edge through effective marketing, strong agent relationships, and a thorough underwriting process."
96,"the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments . these estimates may change as new events occur , as more experience is acquired , as additional information is obtained and as the company 's operating environment changes . materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known , including estimates not deemed Â“criticalÂ” under the proposed rule by the sec . the company believes the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company 's consolidated financial statements and the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies . the selection of accounting estimates , including those deemed Â“critical , Â” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors . the critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the disclosures elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements . significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements . goodwill : effective october 1 , 2001 , the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no . 142 , Â“goodwill and other intangible assetsÂ” ( Â“sfas 142Â” ) . sfas 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings . sfas 142 requires goodwill to be reviewed for possible impairment using fair value 22 measurement techniques on an annual basis , or if circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist . specifically , goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process . the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its net book value , including goodwill . if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the net book value , no impairment is required and the second step is unnecessary . if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value , the second step is performed to determine the amount of the impairment , if any . fair value measures include quoted market price , present value technique ( estimate of future cash flows ) , and a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings or revenue . the second step compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit with the net book value of the reporting unit . if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value , an impairment loss shall be recognized in the amount equal to that excess . the implied fair value is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination . that is , the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had just been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit . determining fair value and the implied fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions . these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of the impairment charge . the company 's estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows . this approach uses significant assumptions such as a discount rate , growth rate , rig count , company price book increases or decreases , and inflation rate . during the first fiscal quarter of 2002 , the company performed a transitional fair value based impairment test utilizing discounted estimated cash flows to evaluate any possible impairment of goodwill , and determined that fair value exceeded the net book value at october 1 , 2001 , therefore no impairment loss has been recorded . no impairment adjustment was necessary to the company 's $ 879.7 million goodwill balance at september 30 , 2003. see notes 2 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on goodwill and segments . pension plans : pension expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no . 87 , Â“employers ' accounting for pensions.Â” in accordance with sfas 87 , the company utilizes an estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and any difference from the actual return is the unrecognized gain/loss which is amortized into earnings in future periods . the company determines the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis using a third-party actuary . in determining the annual estimate of net periodic pension cost , the company is required to make an evaluation of critical assumptions such as discount rate , expected long-term rate of return and expected increase in compensation levels . these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions . discount rates are based on high quality corporate fixed income investments . long-term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of the company 's asset allocation and returns being earned by similar investments . the rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon our historical salary experience . the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods , and , therefore , generally affect our recognized expense in future periods . as with many companies , during 2002 , actual asset returns for the company 's pension assets were adversely impacted by the continued deterioration of the equity markets and declining interest rates . the negative asset returns and declining discount rates unfavorably affected the company 's funded status . as a result , in calendar year 2004 , the company will have a minimum pension funding requirement of $ 11.1 million . story_separator_special_tag in addition , there were approximately $ 4 million in combined costs from the devaluation of argentina 's currency and severance costs incurred in connection with reductions in personnel in canada and latin america during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. the eastern hemisphere experienced a 4 % decrease in operating income from fiscal 2001 primarily due to decreased profitability in the europe and africa region . outlook the company expects international drilling activity outside of canada to remain relatively flat for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. drilling activity in canada is expected to increase approximately 5 % for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003. effective july 1 , 2003 , the company implemented a price book increase of 5 % in canada , which will be phased in over the next several quarters . the degree of customer acceptance of the price book increase will depend on activity levels and competitive pressures . currently , most of our canadian revenue generated is on the new price book . other oilfield services segment the other oilfield services segment consists of production chemicals , casing and tubular services , process and pipeline services , and with the acquisition of osca on may 31 , 2002 , completion tools and completion fluids services in the u.s. and select markets internationally . see Â“businessÂ” included elsewhere in the company 's 2003 annual report on form 10-k for more information . results for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 revenue was $ 358.5 million , an increase of $ 104.8 million , or 41 % when compared to fiscal 2002. the increase was due primarily to the addition of completion fluids and completion tools service lines acquired with osca on may 31 , 2002. other oilfield services revenue ( excluding completion fluids and completion tools ) increased 9 % , primarily as a result of geographic expansion of our casing and tubular services and the process and pipeline services . operating income for the company 's other oilfield services segment was $ 49.9 million , an increase of $ 19.7 million , or 65 % from prior year . the increase was due primarily to the addition of completion fluids and completion tools service lines acquired with osca on may 31 , 2002. other oilfield services operating income ( excluding completion fluids and completion tools ) increased 12.5 % , primarily as a result of geographic expansion of our casing and tubular services and the process and pipeline services , which is consistent with the increase in revenue mentioned above . results for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 revenue was $ 253.7 million , an increase of $ 34.7 million , or 16 % when compared to fiscal 2001. approximately $ 32 million of the increase relates to the completion fluids and completion tools service lines acquired with osca , effective may 31 , 2002. other oilfield services revenue ( excluding completion fluids and 28 completion tools ) increased 3 % in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. casing and tubular service revenue increased by 15 % through activity improvements and expansion in west africa and the middle east . the process and pipeline and production chemicals division revenue was flat compared to fiscal 2001. operating income for the company 's other oilfield services segment was $ 30.2 million , a decrease of $ 4.2 million , or 12 % from prior year . despite the increase in revenue , there were reduced profit margins in process and pipeline services operations combined with $ 1.7 million of costs associated with the acquisition of osca , consisting primarily of the disposal of completion tools deemed obsolete as a result of the combination . other oilfield services operating income ( excluding completion fluids and completion tools ) decreased 11 % , due to reduced profit margins in process and pipeline service operations . outlook we expect revenue for this segment to increase modestly in fiscal 2004 , primarily attributable to expanded markets for the completion tools and completion fluids business . story_separator_special_tag borrowing alternatives . off balance sheet transactions in december 1999 , the company contributed certain pumping service equipment to a limited partnership . the equipment is used to provide services to the company 's customers for which the company pays a service 30 fee over a period of at least six years , but not more than 13 years , at approximately $ 12 million annually . this is accounted for as an operating lease and is included in Â“obligations under equipment financing arrangementsÂ” in the contractual obligations section below . the company owns a 1 % interest in the limited partnership . the transaction resulted in a gain that is being deferred and amortized over 13 years . the balance of the deferred gain was $ 33.9 million and $ 47.8 million as of september 30 , 2003 and september 30 , 2002 , respectively . the agreement permits substitution of equipment within the partnership as long as the implied fair value of the new property transferred in at the date of substitution equals or exceeds the implied fair value , as defined , of the current property in the partnership that is being replaced . the company received partnership approval in september 2003 to substitute certain pumping service equipment and has accounted for it as an exchange of like-kind assets with no earnings impact since the earnings process has not yet culminated . as a result of the substitutions , the deferred gain was reduced by $ 9.2 million as of september 30 , 2003. in september 2010 , the company has the option , but not the obligation , to purchase the pumping service equipment for approximately $ 32 million . in 1997 , the company contributed certain pumping service equipment to a limited partnership . the equipment is used to provide services to the company 's customers for which the company pays a service fee over a period
","The company utilizes historical data and reasonable assumptions to make estimates that inform its consolidated financial statements, which may change with new information or shifts in the operating environment. Key accounting policies include goodwill, which, under SFAS 142, is not amortized but reviewed annually for impairment using fair value measurements. As of September 30, 2003, the company reported a goodwill balance of $879.7 million with no impairment losses recorded. Pension expenses are calculated per SFAS 87, requiring critical assumptions like discount rates and expected returns, with a minimum funding requirement of $11.1 million for 2004 due to adverse market conditions. The company faced $4 million in costs from currency devaluation and severance in 2002, while the eastern hemisphere saw a 4% decline in operating income. For fiscal 2003, revenue from the other oilfield services segment reached $358.5 million, a 41% increase from 2002, driven by the acquisition of OSCA, with operating income rising 65% to $49.9 million. The company anticipates a 5% increase in Canadian drilling activity for fiscal 2004 and a modest revenue increase in the other oilfield services segment. Additionally, the company has a deferred gain of $33.9 million from a partnership involving pumping service equipment, with an option to purchase the equipment for approximately $32 million in 2010."
97,"we are an industry leader in developing and commercializing advanced packaging and test technologies . we believe these advanced technology solutions provide substantial value to our customers , particularly in the mobile communications market , where growth generally outpaces the overall semiconductor industry . advanced packages are now the preferred choice in both the high-end and the mid-range segments of the smartphone market , which together account for a high portion of mobile phone semiconductor value . the demand for advanced packages is also being driven by second-wave mobile device customers , who are transitioning out of wirebond into wafer-level and flip-chip packages . interest in advanced packages for automotive applications is growing as well , largely due to new , data-intensive applications , which require increased pin count and performance . we believe that our technology leadership and this technology transition create significant growth opportunities for us . we typically look for opportunities in the advanced packaging and test area where we can generate reasonably quick returns on investments made for customers seeking leading edge technologies . we also focus on developing a second wave of customers to fill the capacity that becomes available when leading edge customers transition to newer packaging and test equipment and platforms . in addition , we are seeking to add new customers and to deepen our engagement with existing customers . this includes an expanded emphasis on the automotive end market where semiconductor content continues to grow and in the analog area for our mainstream wirebond technologies . from time to time , we identify attractive opportunities to grow our customer base and expand the markets we serve through joint ventures , acquisitions and other strategic investments . for example , in may 2017 we acquired nanium , which has strengthened our position in the market for wafer-level fan-out packaging . we believe that taking advantage of these opportunities helps to diversify our revenue streams , improve our profits , broaden our portfolio of services and maintain our technological leadership . as a supplier in the semiconductor industry , our business is cyclical and impacted by broad economic factors . historical trends indicate there has been a strong correlation between worldwide gross domestic product levels , consumer spending and semiconductor industry cycles . the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged cyclical upturns and downturns in the past . we can not predict the timing , strength or duration of any correction , economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery . while customer demand for our services was , overall , quite strong throughout 2020 , particularly in the communications and consumer end markets , demand in automotive and industrial was lower through most of the year due to the covid-19 pandemic . we made many adjustments to our operations during 2020 to navigate through the onset of the pandemic , and through these efforts we were able to continue serving customers and grow the business in a challenging environment . 36 the full potential effect of the covid-19 pandemic is unknown , and there is significant uncertainty related to the ultimate impact that the covid-19 pandemic will have on the global economy , our business , results of operations and financial condition . see part i , item 1a , including , â€œ the covid-19 outbreak has impacted and may continue to impact the supply chain and consumer demand for our customers ' products and services , which may adversely affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition â€ and â€œ dependence on the highly cyclical semiconductor industry - our packaging and test services are used in volatile industries and industry downturns , and declines in global economic and financial conditions could harm our performance . â€ we operate in a capital intensive industry . servicing our current and future customers requires that we incur significant operating expenses and continue to make significant capital expenditures , which are generally made in advance of the related revenues and without firm customer commitments . we fund our operations , including capital expenditures and debt service requirements , with cash flows from operations , existing cash and cash equivalents , short-term investments , borrowings under available credit facilities and proceeds from any additional financing . maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity is important to our business and depends on , among other considerations , the performance of our business , our capital expenditure levels , our ability to repay debt out of our operating cash flows or proceeds from debt or equity financings and our investment strategy . as of december 31 , 2020 , we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $ 698.0 million and $ 133.8 million , respectively . our net sales , gross profit , operating income , cash flows , liquidity and capital resources have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of many factors , including the seasonality of our business , the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and other factors discussed in part 1 , item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k. 2020 financial summary our net sales increased $ 997.9 million or 24.6 % to $ 5,050.6 million in 2020 from $ 4,052.7 million in 2019. the increase was generally attributable to higher sales of advanced products in the communications , consumer and computing end markets , partially offset by a decline in the automotive and industrial end market . gross profit increased $ 251.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019 , primarily due to the increase in net sales , partially offset by changes in the mix of products sold toward products with higher material content . story_separator_special_tag the consideration , including variable consideration , is allocated between the distinct services in a combined offering based upon the stand-alone selling prices of the individual services . our services involve a high degree of specialization which are unique based on the design and purpose of the customer 's wafers . accordingly , our negotiated pricing reflects the customized nature of our services and represents a customer-specific stand-alone selling price . we recognize revenue as services are rendered , which generally occurs over the course of two to three weeks . services are generally billed at completion of each individual packaging or test service or in some instances at the completion of all services in a combined offering . we recognize revenue over time as services are rendered because our services create or enhance the customer 's wafer . we utilize an input method ( cost incurred plus estimated margin ) to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process , but incomplete , customer orders at a reporting date . during the period of providing our services , we generally do not control or take ownership of customers ' wafers , nor do we include the cost of the wafer in our cost calculations . we believe that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how we satisfy our performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred to package and or test customer wafers are not linear over the duration of these services . 44 shipping and handling costs are accounted for as a cost to fulfill our performance obligations to customers . accordingly , we record customer payments of shipping and handling costs as a component of net sales , and the costs incurred for shipping and handling are then charged to cost of sales . income taxes . we operate in and file income tax returns in various u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions which are subject to examination by tax authorities . the tax returns for years where the statute of limitations remains open in all jurisdictions in which we do business are subject to change upon examination . we believe that we have estimated and provided adequate accruals for potential additional taxes and related interest expense that may ultimately result from such examinations . we believe that any additional taxes or related interest over the amounts accrued will not have a material effect on our financial condition , results of operations or cash flows . however , resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there can be no assurance that the outcomes will be favorable . in addition , changes in the mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries , expiration of tax holidays or changes in tax laws or regulations could result in increased tax expense and effective tax rates in the future . additionally , we monitor on an ongoing basis our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and whether there is a need for a related valuation allowance . in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdictions from which they arise , we consider all available positive and negative evidence , including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities , projected future taxable income , tax planning strategies and results of recent operations . for most of our deferred tax assets , we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income to allow us to realize these deferred tax assets . however , in the event taxable income falls short of current expectations , we may need to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets . we have valuation allowances on certain u.s. federal net operating loss and u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards expected to expire unused and select deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions . such valuation allowances are released as the related tax benefits are realized or when sufficient evidence exists to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized . valuation of inventory . we order raw materials based on customers ' forecasted demand . if our customers change their forecasted requirements and we are unable to cancel our raw materials order or if our vendors require that we order a minimum quantity that exceeds the current forecasted demand , we will experience a build-up in raw material inventory . we will either seek to recover the cost of the materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in production . however , we may not be successful in recovering the cost from our customers or be able to use the inventory in production and , accordingly , if we believe that it is probable that we will not be able to recover such costs , we reduce the carrying value of our inventory . additionally , we reduce the carrying value of our inventories for the cost of inventory we estimate is excess and obsolete based on the age of our inventories . when a determination is made that the inventory will not be utilized in production or is not saleable , it is written-off . inventories consist of raw materials and purchased components and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value . cost is principally determined by standard cost or the weighted moving average method , both of which approximate actual cost . for inventory valued using the standard cost method , we review and set our standard costs as needed , but at a minimum on an annual basis . valuation of long-lived assets . we review long-lived assets , which include property , plant and equipment and goodwill , for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable . factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following : significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results ; significant changes
","As an industry leader in advanced packaging and test technologies, we focus on delivering substantial value, particularly in the mobile communications market, which is growing faster than the overall semiconductor industry. Advanced packages dominate both high-end and mid-range smartphone segments, contributing significantly to mobile phone semiconductor value. The demand for these packages is also increasing in automotive applications due to data-intensive needs. In 2020, our net sales rose by $997.9 million (24.6%) to $5,050.6 million, driven by higher sales in communications, consumer, and computing markets, despite a decline in automotive and industrial sectors. Our gross profit increased by $251.4 million, reflecting this sales growth. As of December 31, 2020, we held $698 million in cash and cash equivalents and $133.8 million in short-term investments. We actively seek to expand our customer base through joint ventures and acquisitions, such as the 2017 acquisition of Nanium, enhancing our wafer-level fan-out packaging capabilities. Our operations are capital-intensive, requiring significant expenditures ahead of revenue generation, and we maintain liquidity through operational cash flows and financing. The semiconductor industry is cyclical, influenced by global economic conditions, and while demand was strong in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created uncertainties affecting supply chains and consumer demand."
98,"we also purchase the majority of our semi-precious and synthetic stones from a single supplier in germany . the prices for these products are denominated in euros . we generally are able to pass on price increases in gold and stones to our customers as such increases are realized by us , however , this may not always be the case . we face competition for most of our principal products . the class ring and yearbook markets are highly concentrated and consist primarily of a few national manufacturers ( of which we are one ) and , to a significantly lesser extent , small regional competitors . we believe that it would be costly and time-consuming for new competitors to replicate the production and distribution capabilities necessary to compete effectively in this market , and as a result , there have been no major new competitors in the last 61 years . 21 we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales tied primarily to the school year . we recorded 46 % of our fiscal year 2007 net sales in our third quarter . class ring sales are highest during october through december and early spring , with many orders made for delivery to students before the winter holiday season . graduation product sales are predominantly made during february through april prior to the april through june graduation season . yearbook sales are highest during the months of april through june , as yearbooks are typically shipped prior to each school 's summer break . our recognition and affinity product line sales are seasonal . the majority of our achievement publications are shipped in august of each year . the remaining recognition and affinity product line sales are highest during the winter holiday season and in the period leading up to mother 's day . we have experienced operating losses during our first and fourth fiscal quarters , which includes the beginning of the school year and the summer months when school is not in session , thus reducing related shipment of products . in addition , our working capital requirements tend to exceed our operating cash flows from may through september . we also have exposure to market risk relating to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt . our senior secured credit facility ( revolver and term loan ) and existing gold consignment agreement are variable rate arrangements . historically , growth in the class rings , yearbooks and graduation products market has been driven primarily by demographics . the u.s. department of education projects that the number of high school graduates will increase by an average of 6 % over the time period from 2003 to 2016 and the number of college graduates will increase by an average of 22 % over the time period from 2003 to 2016. additionally , the u.s. census bureau projects that the total u.s. population will increase by 6 % over the time period from 2007 to 2015. both the increased population , and the increased number of high school and college graduates should expand the market for our products . basis of presentation we present financial information relating to parent holdings , intermediate holdings and aac and its subsidiaries in this discussion and analysis . parent holdings owns 100 % of the shares of common stock of intermediate holdings . intermediate holdings owns 100 % of the shares of common stock of aac holding corp. , which is the holder of 100 % of the shares of common stock of aac . the company uses a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the last saturday of august . company background our business was founded when the operations of artcarved , which were previously owned by cjc holdings , inc. , and the operations of balfour , which were previously owned by l.g . balfour company , inc. , were combined through various asset purchase agreements in december 1996. aac was formed in june 2000 to serve as a holding company for these operations as well as any future acquisitions . in june 2000 , we acquired the taylor senior holding company , the parent company of taylor publishing company ( â€œ taylor â€ ) , whose primary business is designing and printing student yearbooks . in march 2001 , aac acquired all of the capital stock of educational communications , inc. ( â€œ eci â€ ) , which publishes achievement publications . in july 2002 , aac acquired all the outstanding stock and warrants of milestone marketing , a marketer of class rings and other graduation products to the college market . in january 2004 , aac acquired c-b graduation announcements , a marketer of graduation products to the college market . in april 2007 , commemorative brands , inc. ( â€œ cbi â€ ) , a wholly-owned subsidiary of aac , acquired all of the outstanding stock of bfj holdings , inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary , powers embroidery , inc. ( â€œ powers â€ ) . powers is a producer of quality letter jackets , chenille patches and other school spirit embroidery merchandise and is located in waco , texas . on march 25 , 2004 , aac acquisition corp. , a wholly owned subsidiary of aac holding corp. , merged with and into aac ( the â€œ merger â€ ) , with aac continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of aac holding corp. the merger was financed by a cash equity investment by an investor group led by fenway partners capital fund ii , l.p. , borrowings under aac 's senior secured credit facility and the issuance of aac 's 8.25 % senior subordinated notes due 2012. as a result of the merger , we have reflected pre-merger periods ( â€œ predecessor â€ ) for results of operations through march 25 , 2004 and post-merger periods ( â€œ successor â€ ) for results of operations subsequent to march 25 , 2004 story_separator_special_tag under the provisions of sfas 142 , we test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators occur . as a result of the annual impairment review performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 , we recorded an impairment of $ 4.9 million related to goodwill and trademarks in our retail class rings business that is included in our class rings business segment and $ 0.3 million related to trademarks in our personalized fashion jewelry business that is included in our other business segment to adjust the carrying value to the current net realizable value . these charges are included in other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations . the goodwill impairment in retail class rings was primarily due to lower revenue forecasts reflecting the softness in the retail jewelry market serving class rings and the continued consolidation in the independent jeweler segment . however , significant judgments were required in the preparation of our forecasts . unforeseen future events could adversely affect such forecasts and thereby the reported value of goodwill and trademarks in the future . the annual impairment review performed in our other businesses did not reveal any impairment as we forecast continued profitable performance in all our core on-campus businesses and our other retail businesses . in april 2007 , cbi acquired all of the outstanding stock of bfj holdings , inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary , powers . powers is a producer of quality letter jackets , chenille patches and other school spirit embroidery merchandise , located in waco , texas . the purchase price in connection with this acquisition was approximately $ 6.2 million , including transaction costs , with up to $ 1.5 million additional to be paid upon achieving certain financial goals through august 2010. the powers acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting . 26 results of operations the comparative results are presented and discussed for parent holdings , intermediate holdings , and aac for fiscal years 2007 , 2006 and 2005. replace_table_token_8_th replace_table_token_9_th replace_table_token_10_th 27 fiscal year ended august 25 , 2007 compared to fiscal year ended august 26 , 2006 net sales . net sales consist of product sales and are net of product returns and promotional discounts . net sales decreased $ 5.2 million , or 1.6 % , to $ 315.7 million in fiscal 2007 from $ 320.9 million in fiscal 2006. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales in achievement publications and retail class rings , partially offset by stronger sales of on-campus class rings , personalized family jewelry , commercial printing , graduation products , yearbooks , and sales of letter jackets attributed to the acquisition of powers in april 2007. class rings . net sales increased $ 1.5 million to $ 120.9 million in fiscal 2007 from $ 119.4 million in fiscal 2006. the increase in net sales from class rings was the result of a $ 4.2 million increase in on-campus class ring sales , partially offset by a decline of $ 2.7 million in retail high school class ring sales . the increase in on-campus class ring sales was primarily due to price increases , new products and improved sales of championship rings . these increases were partially offset by a volume decrease due to a number of schools starting one or two weeks later in 2007 than in 2006 and the change in product sales mix caused by continuing increases in gold prices , causing buyers to purchase lower priced non-gold rings . the decline in retail sales of high school class rings was driven by the continuing softness in the retail jewelry market , the declining number of independent jewelers and the change in product mix . yearbooks . net sales increased $ 0.3 million to $ 115.2 million in fiscal 2007 from $ 114.9 million in fiscal 2006. the increase in net sales was primarily the result of an increase in yearbook contracts shipped , partially offset by a decline in average contract value as a result of pricing pressures in the smaller book segment of the yearbook market . graduation products . net sales increased $ 0.5 million to $ 44.4 million in fiscal 2007 from $ 43.9 million in fiscal 2006. the increase was mainly due to an increase in shipments of graduation products , primarily due to increases in sales of college graduation products . achievement publications . net sales decreased $ 15.8 million to $ 5.1 million in fiscal 2007 from $ 21.0 million in fiscal 2006. the severe decline in sales of achievement publications and collateral of $ 8.0 million was primarily a result of solicitation mailings to students and teachers that occurred in the fourth quarter , which yielded a dramatic unexpected decline in book and collateral purchase response rate from the comparable mailings made during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006. net sales also decreased $ 5.5 million as a result of only publishing one who 's who among american high school students , our publication honoring high school students , in fiscal 2007 and an additional decline in net sales of $ 2.3 million as a result of not publishing the national dean 's list in fiscal 2007. the national dean 's list publication will ship in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and net sales will be approximately $ 1.2 million compared to $ 2.3 million for the 2006 publication . other . net sales increased $ 8.3 million to $ 30.0 million in fiscal 2007 from $ 21.7 million in fiscal 2006. the increase in net sales was the result of increased shipments of personalized fashion jewelry of $ 2.5 million primarily resulting from continued expansion of our personalized family jewelry products in the mass merchant channels and from a favorable competitive environment , $ 2.5 million of sales of letter jackets related to the acquisition of powers in april 2007
","The company primarily sources its semi-precious and synthetic stones from a single German supplier, with prices in euros. While it generally passes on price increases for gold and stones to customers, this is not always feasible due to competition in the class ring and yearbook markets, which are dominated by a few national manufacturers. The market has seen no major new competitors in the last 61 years, as replicating production and distribution capabilities is costly. Seasonal sales fluctuations are significant, with 46% of fiscal year 2007 net sales of $315.7 million occurring in the third quarter, driven by class ring sales peaking from October to December and graduation products from February to April. The company has faced operating losses in the first and fourth quarters, particularly during summer months. The U.S. Department of Education projects a 6% increase in high school graduates and a 22% increase in college graduates from 2003 to 2016, which may expand the market. In fiscal year 2007, net sales decreased by $5.2 million (1.6%) from $320.9 million in 2006, attributed to lower sales in achievement publications and retail class rings, despite increases in on-campus class rings and other products. Class ring sales rose to $120.9 million, while yearbook sales increased to $115.2 million. Achievement publications saw a significant decline of $15.8 million to $5.1 million due to reduced solicitation effectiveness. The company also reported a $4.9 million impairment related to goodwill in its retail class rings business, reflecting lower revenue forecasts. The fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of August, and the company has made several acquisitions since its formation in 2000, including Taylor Publishing and Powers Embroidery, enhancing its product offerings."
99,"over the course of the year , we experienced the following changes to o ur consolidated revenues : first quarter constant currency revenue decrease of 2.2 % , 0.1 % decrease in constant currency in the second quarter , 0.3 % constant currency increase in the third quarter , with a deterioration in the fourth quarter to a 1.8 % constant currency decrease . we remain highly focused on our business in europe , where southern and northern europe segments combined reflect 66 % of our total consolidated revenues . in 2019 , several key markets within southern and northern europe experienced revenue declines , partially offset by constant currency revenue increases in certain markets within the americas and apme . we experienced a revenue decline in organic constant currency in southern europe due to the revenue decline s in france and italy , partially offset by organic constant currency revenue growth in certain markets within other southern europe . the revenue decrease in northern europe was primarily due to the decrease s in germany , the netherlands , and sweden due mostly to reduced demand from the manufacturing sector in those markets and uncertainties related to global trade conflicts . in the americas , revenues increased 3.6 % in constant currency due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services in certain markets within other americas and an increase in our manpowergroup solutions business . these increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in the united states primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim due to the challenging manufacturing environment . our gross profit margin in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to the decreased margins in our higher-margin manpowergroup solutions business , particularly within our talent based outsourcing business , partially offset by a favorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates . our operating profit decreased 19.1 % in 2019 ( -15.6 % in constant currency and -14.4 % in organic constant currency ) while our operating profit margin decreased 50 basis points compared to 2018. included in 2019 and 2018 were $ 39.8 million and $ 39.3 million , respectively , of restructuring costs . the 2019 restructuring costs were primarily related to our delivery channel and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities , as well as adjusting our cost-base for the slower market environment in many of our european operations . the 2018 restructuring costs were primarily related to the integration of certain acquisitions and front-office , back-office and delivery-model optimization . we recorded $ 64.0 million of goodwill impairment charges related to our investments in germany and new zealand ( $ 60.2 million and $ 3.8 million , respectively ) and additional charges of $ 1.6 million related to our new zealand operations in 2019. manpowergroup greater china limited , which operates in the greater china region of china , taiwan , hong kong , and macau , completed its initial public offering ( â€œ ipo â€ ) on the hong kong stock market on july 10 , 2019 , resulting in deconsolidation of the entity . as a result of this transaction , we recognized a non-cash accounting gain of $ 30.4 million ( see further information in note 4 of our consolidated financial statements ) . manpowergroup greater china limited 's results through july 10 , 2019 , were included in our 2019 consolidated results . excluding the restructuring costs in both 2019 and 2018 , the goodwill impairment and other related charges and the ipo noncash accounting gain , our operating profit was down 8.5 % in organic constant currency with operating profit margin down 30 basis points compared to 2018. we continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures , while investing appropriately to support the growth in the business and enhance our productivity and technology and digital capabilities . although 2019 was a challenging year , we have made good progress advancing the key initiatives that we believe will position us well for future revenue growth . we anticipate the overall strength of labor markets will continue , though not evenly distributed across regions and industries , amidst high levels of talent shortage and changing client skill needs due to the increased pace of technological and transformational changes . despite headwinds from geopolitical forces , including the adverse impact of global trade conflict on growth and employment in the manufacturing sector , we believe we are well-positioned to help our clients address these challenges with our market-leading global footprint and our portfolio of solutions and services . in early 2020 , there has been potential progress on trade agreements , but even if trade issues are resolved , we anticipate that instability resulting from trade policies may continue to impact our business for a period of time , particularly within the manufacturing sector . if consumer confidence remains at high levels , supported by low unemployment levels in many of our key countries , we expect our outlook will be stable over the coming several quarters . 30 consolidated results - 2019 compared to 2018 the following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2019 as compared to 2018. replace_table_token_4_th the year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 5.1 % ( -0.9 % in constant currency and -1.0 % in organic constant currency ) was attributed to : decreased demand for services in several of our markets within northern europe , where revenues decreased 12.6 % ( -7.6 % in constant currency and -6.8 % in organic constant currency ) , primarily due to reduced demand for our manpower staffing services due to low levels of manufacturing activity and uncertainties related to global trade conflicts , and the disposition of our language translation business in the netherlands at the end of december 2018. we experienced revenue declines in germany , the netherlands , belgium , the united kingdom , and the story_separator_special_tag and 10.2 % , respectively ( -0.1 % , -21.1 % , -2.6 % , -20.5 % and -5.3 % , respectively , in constant currency ; -1.4 % and -16.7 % in organic constant currency in the nordics and the netherlands , respectively ) . the northern europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our manpower staffing services , primarily because of the decrease in germany resulting from lower production activity in the manufacturing sector in that market , decreases in our staffing/interim services in the netherlands due to a reduction in manufacturing-related demand and the exit from certain client contracts as a result of pricing decisions , decreased demand in sweden related to lower activity from our manufacturing clients , and uncertainties related to global trade conflicts . this decrease was also due to a decrease in our manpowergroup solutions business from the disposition of our language translation business in the netherlands at the end of december 2018 and the 10.8 % decrease ( -5.6 % in constant currency ) in the permanent recruitment business . these decreases were partially offset by an increased demand for our staffing/interim services in norway . gross profit margin decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decline in our staffing/interim margin , primarily as a result of business mix changes , lower associate utilization and higher vacation and sickness rates in germany , and the decrease in our permanent recruitment business . selling and administrative expenses decreased 12.9 % ( -7.7 % in constant currency and -6.6 % in organic constant currency ) in 2019 compared to 2018 , due to the decrease in salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction in headcount and a decrease in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices , a decrease in consulting costs related to certain technology projects , front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities incurred in the latter part of 2018 and a decrease in restructuring costs to $ 19.8 million in 2019 from $ 33.3 million in 2018. these decreases were partially offset by the $ 8.4 million gain from the sale of a non-core language translation business in the netherlands in 2018. the 2019 restructuring costs related to delivery model and other front-office centralization activities as well as back-office optimization activities primarily in germany , the netherlands , sweden , and belgium . the 2018 restructuring costs related to delivery model and other front-office centralization activities as well as back-office optimization activities primarily in the united kingdom , germany , the netherlands , norway and belgium . oup margin for northern europe decreased to 1.4 % in 2019 from 2.3 % in 2018 primarily due to the decrease in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging , as we were unable to decrease expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline , partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs . apme revenues from services decreased 9.1 % ( -7.2 % in constant currency and an increase of 3.7 % in organic constant currency ) in 2019 compared to 2018. in japan ( which represents 37 % of apme 's revenues ) , revenues from services increased 6.9 % ( 5.5 % in constant currency ) due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services , an increase in our manpowergroup solutions business , and a 9.5 % increase ( 8.3 % in constant currency ) in our permanent recruitment business , partially offset by the unfavorable impact of five fewer billing days in 2019 compared to 2018. in australia ( which represents 16 % of apme 's revenues ) , revenue from services decreased 25.0 % ( -19.1 % in constant currency ) as we chose to exit certain low-margin manpower business to improve profitability , and due to the 6.8 % decrease ( increase of 0.3 % in constant currency ) in our permanent recruitment business . the revenue decrease in the remaining markets in apme is due to the deconsolidation and disposition of a low-margin business in greater china at the end of december 2018 , partially offset by increased demand for manpower staffing services , mostly in india , korea and thailand . gross profit margin decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 18.6 % ( -14.7 % in constant currency ; increase of 0.4 % in organic constant currency ) , partially offset by the increase in our staffing/interim margin , due primarily to the improvement in japan , and the disposition of a low-margin business in greater china in december 2018 . 35 selling and administrative expenses de creased 15.3 % ( - 12.7 % in constant currency and - 2.1 % in organic constant currency ) in 2019 compared to 2018 . the de crease is primarily due to the gain from the d econsolidation , the reduction of recurring selling and administrative costs as a result of the d econsolidation and disposition of a low-margin business in greater china in december 2018 , and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates . these decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs to support the increase in revenues in certain markets . oup margin for apme increased to 4.7 % in 2019 compared to 4.0 % in 2018 due to the gain from the deconsolidation , partially offset by the decline in the gross profit margin and an increase in restructuring costs . right management in 2019 , revenues from services for right management decreased 1.6 % ( increase of 0.9 % in constant currency ) . the decrease is primarily due to the 7.3 % decrease ( -5.1 % in constant currency ) in our talent management services due mostly to softening demand in our european and asian markets and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates . our outplacement business was flat ( increase of 2.6 % in
","In 2019, the company faced a challenging year with consolidated revenues experiencing a year-over-year decrease of 5.1%, translating to a decline of 0.9% in constant currency and 1.0% in organic constant currency. Quarterly performance showed a first-quarter revenue decrease of 2.2%, a second-quarter decline of 0.1%, a third-quarter increase of 0.3%, and a fourth-quarter drop of 1.8%. The European market, particularly southern and northern Europe, accounted for 66% of total revenues, with significant declines in France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden due to reduced manufacturing demand and global trade uncertainties. Conversely, the Americas saw a 3.6% revenue increase in constant currency, driven by staffing services demand, although the U.S. faced a slight decline. The gross profit margin decreased primarily due to lower margins in the manpower solutions business, leading to a 19.1% drop in operating profit. Restructuring costs were $39.8 million in 2019, with additional goodwill impairment charges of $64 million. The company also recorded a non-cash gain of $30.4 million from the IPO of its Greater China operations. Selling and administrative expenses decreased by 12.9%, reflecting a reduction in headcount and office-related costs. The operating profit margin fell by 50 basis points, and the company anticipates continued labor market strength despite geopolitical challenges."
100,"since launching zedge premium , we have made and continue making material investments in optimizing our zedge app 's homepage design in order to maximize exposure to premium content with the goal of driving sales . over time , we expect that zedge premium will contribute to a virtuous cycle whereby it drives new consumers into our zedge app resulting in more artist payouts , which in turn makes the platform more attractive for artists and brands looking to expand their reach and increase their income . in january 2019 , we started offering freemium zedge app users the ability to convert into paying subscribers for amongst other things the ability to remove unsolicited advertisements from our zedge app . as of july 31 , 2020 , we had more than 504,000 active paid subscribers . in fiscal 2021 , we hope to further optimize the offer based on user type , geography and price point as well as introduce new subscription enhancements like content bundles and rewards . in december 2019 , we completed the beta launch of 'shortz ' our new entertainment app offering serialized , short-form fiction delivered in a text-message format across both android and ios , focusing on users in the united states , the united kingdom and canada and it is now available globally . over the past several years , our zedge app has experienced a continuing decline in its mau as well as a shift in the regional customer make-up with mau in emerging markets representing an increasing portion of our user base . as of july 31 , 2020 , users in emerging markets represented 70 % of our mau compared to 65 % a year prior . this shift has negatively impacted revenue because advertising rates in emerging markets are materially lower than in well-developed markets . in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 , users in emerging markets grew by 1.4 % while users in well-developed economies declined 18.6 % when compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. as of july 31 , 2020 , approximately 50 % of our zedge app 's user base was located in north america and europe ( including eastern europe ) with a split of 26 % and 24 % , respectively , compared with 54 % as of july 31 , 2019 with 27 % in each of north america and europe ( including eastern europe ) . mau growth is tightly coupled with securing new users . historically , our relatively high ranking in the google play store has been one of the primary drivers for securing new users . although still an important factor , we now also dedicate resources to growth initiatives , both organic and paid . with time , we believe that we can change our growth dynamic in well-developed markets . aside from targeted growth initiatives , we need to continually improve the core user experience , test different mechanisms and content verticals that may spur growth and capitalize on the role that zedge premium artists can have on driving new users into the zedge platform . 24 the covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our zedge app 's new user growth . we believe that new smartphone sales have suffered as a result of retail business closures , negatively impacting new user growth , especially in well-developed markets . assuming the retail business rebounds from the covid-19 pandemic , we expect that our zedge app 's new user growth will also recover and we will benefit accordingly . during the quarter and fiscal year ended july 31 , 2020 , we generated approximately 73 % and 78 % , respectively , of our revenues from selling our zedge app 's advertising inventory to advertising networks , advertising exchanges , and direct arrangements with advertisers . advertising networks and advertising exchanges are third-party technology platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of media advertising inventory from multiple ad networks . the price of advertising inventory is fixed on an advertising network whereas the price for inventory is determined through real-time bidding on an advertising exchange . advertisers are attracted to our zedge app because of its sizable user base . in our zedge premium marketplace , the content owner sets the price and the user can purchase the content by paying for it with zedge credits , our closed virtual currency . a user can earn zedge credits when taking specific actions such as watching a rewarded video . alternatively , users can buy zedge credits via an in-app purchase . if a user purchases zedge credits , google play or app store keeps 30 % of the purchase price with the remaining 70 % being paid to us . when a user purchases zedge premium content , the artist or brand receives 70 % of the actual value of the zedge credits used to buy the content item as a royalty and we retain the remaining 30 % as our fee , which we recognize as revenue . as zedge premium matures and expands , we expect to also diversify our revenue source mix . in january 2019 , we started offering a subscription-based product to android users of our zedge app in which the payment of a monthly or annual fee would remove unsolicited ads when using our zedge app . during the first 12 months after a customer 's sign up for the subscription-based product , google retains up to 30 % as a fee , which decreases to 15 % from month 13 and beyond . as of july 31 , 2020 , we had more than 504,000 active paid subscribers , 89 % of which had subscribed on an annual basis . during fiscal 2020 , subscriptions have generated approximately $ 2.4 million in gross revenue . story_separator_special_tag as of july 31 , 2020 , users in emerging markets represented 70 % of our mau compared to 65 % a year prior . this shift has negatively impacted revenue because advertising rates in emerging markets are materially lower than in well-developed markets . arpmau was up 50.3 % for the three months ended july 31 , 2020 when compared to the same period a year ago , pointing to progress we have made in generating more value from our users , particularly from subscriptions .

revenue . advertising revenue declined 6.7 % in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the shift in the makeup of our user base from well-developed markets that command relatively higher advertising rates to emerging markets where the rates are lower . the 5.6 % decline in the overall mau also contributed the decline in advertising revenue despite improvement in user engagement in fiscal 2020. paid subscription revenue . we rolled out a subscription-based product on android in january 2019 , whereby users of our zedge app could pay a monthly or annual fee to remove unsolicited ads when using our zedge app . in general , pricing of our monthly subscriptions is $ 0.99 per month and $ 3.99 for yearly subscription . we generated $ 2,406,000 and $ 516,000 in gross prepaid subscription sales consisting of both monthly and annual subscriptions for the fiscal years ended july 31 , 2020 and 2019 respectively . we expect that from time to time the prices of our subscription

of revenues decreased by 13.3 % in fiscal 2020 to $ 1.2 million from $ 1.4 million in fiscal 2019 , primarily attributable to the savings from the migration of our backend infrastructure to cloud-based providers . as a percentage of revenue , direct cost of revenues in fiscal 2020 were 12.6 % as compared to 15.6 . % in fiscal 2019 due to the combination of higher revenue and lower direct costs in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. selling , general and administrative expense . selling , general and administrative expense ( â€œ sg & a â€ ) consists mainly of payroll , benefits , recruiting fees , facilities , marketing , content acquisition costs , consulting , professional fees , software licensing ( â€œ saas â€ ) and public company related expenses . replace_table_token_6_th sg & a expenses decreased $ 1.8 million or 20.1 % in fiscal 2020 to $ 7.1 million from $ 8.9 million in fiscal 2019. these decreases were primarily attributable to a $ 2.1 million reduction in net compensation costs resulting from the workforce reduction plan we implemented in may 2019 and lower discretionary expenses including lower travel expenses caused by the travel ban related to covid-19 , offset by $ 471,000 higher sales and marketing costs related to the google fee on subscriptions sales severance payments , a one-time payment related to copyright matters and content acquisition costs associated with the 'shortz ' app which was launched in december 2019. as the majority of our employees are based in norway a stronger u.s. dollar against nok in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 also contributed to the overall decline of sg & a . our headcount totaled 39 as of july 31 , 2020 compared to 53 as of july 31 , 2019 , primarily resulting from the workforce reduction and organic staff attrition in norway and the u.s. , offset by 7 new hires in lithuania during fiscal 2020 bringing total headcount in lithuania to 16 at july 31 , 2020. sg & a expenses also included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $ 402,000 and $ 499,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively . we also opted to use class b common stock to pay a portion of our board of directors ' compensation and to fund 401 ( k ) matching contributions that aggregated to $ 90,000 and $ 120,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively . see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation . 30 depreciation and amortization . depreciation and amortization expense consists mainly of

","Since the launch of Zedge Premium, significant investments have been made to enhance the Zedge app's homepage design to boost premium content visibility and sales. As of July 31, 2020, Zedge had over 504,000 active paid subscribers, with 89% opting for annual subscriptions, generating approximately $2.4 million in gross revenue for fiscal 2020. The app's user base has shifted, with 70% of monthly active users (MAU) in emerging markets, up from 65% the previous year, negatively impacting revenue due to lower advertising rates. In fiscal 2020, advertising revenue declined by 6.7%, while paid subscription revenue increased significantly. The app's gross transaction value (GTV) from Zedge Premium reached $728,000, with net revenue of $459,000, compared to $485,000 and $130,000 in fiscal 2019, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic has hindered new user growth, particularly in developed markets, but recovery is anticipated as retail businesses rebound. Direct costs of revenue decreased by 13.3% to $1.2 million, and selling, general, and administrative expenses fell by 20.1% to $7.1 million, largely due to workforce reductions and lower discretionary spending. As of July 31, 2020, the company had a total headcount of 39, down from 53 the previous year. Overall, the company aims to diversify its revenue sources and improve user experience to drive growth in both emerging and developed markets."

102,"our international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar . while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations , this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings . 30 alphabet inc. the portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may affect margins . non-advertising revenues have grown over time . we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our users through products and services like google cloud , google play , hardware products , and youtube subscriptions . across these initiatives , we currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps , in-app purchases , digital content products , and hardware ; and licensing and service fees , including fees received for google cloud services and subscription and other services . the margins on these revenues vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues . a number of our other bets initiatives are in their initial development stages , and as such , the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues could be volatile . as we continue to serve our users and expand

capital , contributing to the breadth and depth of our offerings , expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas , and building strong partnerships around strategic initiatives . for example , in 2020 we announced our google for india digitization fund to invest approximately $ 10 billion into india over the next 5-7 years through a mix of equity investments , partnerships ,

substantially consistent from 2019 to 2020. over time , cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues may be affected by a number of factors , including the following : the amount of tac paid to

","Alphabet Inc. has seen a notable increase in its international revenues, which are significantly influenced by foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Despite a foreign exchange risk management program, fluctuations still impact revenues and earnings.

The company continues to invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures, including land and buildings for data centers, while navigating regulatory changes and market volatility."
103,"prior to 2006 , the company 's primary revenue source in its document security division was derived from the licensing of its technology . in 2006 , the company began a series of acquisitions designed to expand its ability to produce its products for end-user customers . in 2006 , we acquired plastic printing professionals , inc. ( â€œ p3 â€ ) , a privately held plastic cards manufacturer located in the san francisco , california area . p3 is also referred to herein as the â€œ dss plastics group â€ . in 2008 , we acquired substantially all of the assets of dpi of rochester , llc , a privately held commercial printer located in rochester , new york , referred to herein as â€œ secuprint â€ or â€œ dss printing group â€ . in 2010 , the company acquired premier packaging corporation ( â€œ premier packaging â€ ) , a privately held packaging company located in the rochester , new york area . premier packaging is also referred to herein as the dss packaging group . in may 2011 , the company acquired all of the capital stock of extradev , inc. ( â€œ extradev â€ ) , a privately held information technology and cloud computing company located in the rochester , new york area . extradev is also referred to herein as the â€œ dss digital group â€ . on july 1 , 2013 , the company merged with dss technology management , inc. ( f/k/a lexington technology group , inc. ) , a private intellectual property monetization company that recently acquired a patent portfolio of six patents and four pending patent applications relating to technology invented by thomas bascom ( the â€œ bascom portfolio â€ ) and invested in virtualagility , inc. a developer of user-friendly programming platforms that facilitate the creation of sophisticated business applications without programming or coding . dss technology management is focused on the economic benefits of intellectual property assets through acquiring or internally developing patents or other intellectual property assets ( or interests therein ) and then monetizing such assets through a variety of value enhancing initiatives , including , but not limited to : Â· licensing , Â· customized technology solutions ( such as applications for medical electronic health records ) , Â· strategic partnerships , and Â· litigation . on october 3 , 2012 , dss technology management , through its wholly-owned subsidiary , bascom research , initiated patent infringement lawsuits in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia against five companies , including facebook , inc. and linkedin corporation , for unlawfully using systems that incorporate features claimed in patents owned by bascom research . the patents included in the lawsuit relate to the data structure used by social and business networking web sites and web 2.0 corporate intranets . on december 12 , 2012 , the lawsuits were transferred to the united states district court for the northern district of california . on july 8 , 2013 , the company 's subsidiary , dss technology management , purchased two patents for $ 500,000 covering certain methods and processes related to bluetooth devices . in conjunction with the patent purchases , dss technology management entered into a proceed right agreement with certain investors whereby dss technology management initially received $ 250,000 of a total of $ 750,000 it will ultimately receive thereunder , subject to certain payment milestones , in exchange for 40 % of the proceeds , if any , from the use , sale or licensing of the two patents . 28 effective on august 2 , 2013 , lexington technology group , inc. changed its name to dss technology management , inc. ( â€œ dss technology management â€ ) . on september 27 , 2013 , dss technology management purchased 10 patents covering certain methods and processes in the semiconductor industry for $ 2,000,000. the company does business in five operating segments as follows : dss packaging group â€” produces custom paperboard packaging serving clients in the pharmaceutical , beverage , photo packaging , toy

technology management â€” acquires or internally develops patented technology or intellectual property assets ( or interests therein ) , with the purpose of monetizing these assets through a variety of value-enhancing initiatives , including , but not limited to , investments in the development and commercialization of patented technologies , licensing , strategic partnerships and commercial litigation . story_separator_special_tag for those reporting units , an entity is required to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists . in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists , an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist . other intangible assets other intangible assets consists of costs associated with the application for patents , acquisition of patents and contractual rights to patents and trade secrets associated with the company 's technologies . the company 's patents and trade secrets are generally for document anti-counterfeiting and anti-scanning technologies and processes that form the basis of the company 's document security business . patent application costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the patent , which generally approximates its legal life . in addition , intangible assets include customer lists and non-compete agreements obtained as a result of acquisitions . intangible asset amortization expense is classified as an operating expense . the company believes that the decision to incur patent costs is discretionary as the associated products or services can be sold prior to or during the application process . the company accounts for other intangible amortization as an operating expense , unless the underlying asset is directly associated with the production or delivery of a product . subsequent to acquisition of patents and trade secrets , legal and associated costs incurred in prosecuting alleged infringements of the patents will be recognized as expense when incurred . costs incurred to renew or extend the term of recognized intangible assets , including patent annuities and fees , and patent defense costs are expensed as incurred . to date , the amount of related amortization expense for other intangible assets directly attributable to revenue recognized is not material . conventional convertible debt when the convertible feature of the conventional convertible debt provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value , this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature ( â€œ bcf `` ) . prior to the determination of the bcf , the proceeds from the debt instrument were first allocated between the convertible debt and any embedded or detachable free standing instruments that are included , such as common stock warrants . we record a bcf as a debt discount pursuant to fasb asc topic 470-20. in those circumstances , the convertible debt will be recorded net of the discount related to the bcf . we amortize the discount to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method . revenue recognition sales of printed products including commercial and security printing , packaging , and plastic cards are recognized when a product or service is delivered , shipped or provided to the customer and all material conditions relating to the sale have been substantially performed . 35 for technology sales and services , revenue is recognized in accordance with the fasb asc 985-605. accordingly , revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied : ( 1 ) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement ; ( 2 ) the service or product has been provided to the customer ; ( 3 ) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable ; and ( 4 ) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured . we recognize cloud computing revenue , including data backup , recovery and security services , on a monthly basis , beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services . professional services are recognized in the period services are provided . for printing technology licenses revenue is recognized once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met : ( 1 ) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists ; ( 2 ) the right and ability to use the product or technology has been rendered ; ( 3 ) the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment ; and ( 4 ) collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured . for other technology licenses , revenue arrangements generally provide for the payment of contractually determined fees in consideration for the grant of certain intellectual property rights for patented technologies owned or controlled by the company . these rights typically include some combination of the following : ( i ) the grant of a non-exclusive , retroactive and future license to manufacture and or sell products covered by patented technologies owned or controlled the company , ( ii ) a covenant-not-to-sue , ( iii ) the release of the licensee from certain claims , and ( iv ) the dismissal of any pending litigation . the intellectual property rights granted may be perpetual in nature , extending until the expiration of the related patents , or can be granted for a defined , relatively short period of time , with the licensee possessing the right to renew the agreement at the end of each contractual term for an additional minimum upfront payment . pursuant to the terms of these agreements , the company has no further obligation with respect to the grant of the non-exclusive retroactive and future licenses , covenants-not-to-sue , releases , and other deliverables , including no express or implied obligation on the company 's part to maintain or upgrade the technology , or provide future support or services . generally , the agreements provide for the grant of the licenses , covenants-not-to-sue , releases , and other significant deliverables upon execution of the agreement , or upon receipt of the minimum upfront payment for term agreement renewals . as such , the earnings process is complete and revenue is recognized upon the execution of the agreement , when collectibility is reasonably assured , or upon receipt of the minimum upfront fee for term agreement renewals , and when all other
","Since 2006, the company has shifted its primary revenue source in the document security division from technology licensing to acquisitions aimed at enhancing product production for end-users. Key acquisitions include Plastic Printing Professionals, Inc. in 2006, DPI of Rochester, LLC in 2008, Premier Packaging Corporation in 2010, and Extradev, Inc. in 2011. In 2013, the company merged with DSS Technology Management, which focuses on monetizing intellectual property assets, including a patent portfolio acquired from Thomas Bascom. Notably, in 2012, DSS Technology Management initiated patent infringement lawsuits against Facebook and LinkedIn, and in 2013, it purchased two patents for $500,000 and ten patents for $2 million related to Bluetooth and semiconductor technologies, respectively. The company operates through five segments: DSS Packaging Group, DSS Printing Group, DSS Plastics Group, DSS Digital Group, and DSS Technology Management, each serving various industries and providing a range of products and services, including secure printing, custom packaging, and cloud-based solutions. Revenue recognition practices include recognizing sales upon delivery and specific criteria for technology sales, ensuring that all conditions for revenue recognition are met. The company also incurs costs related to patent applications and renewals, which are capitalized and amortized over the patents' useful lives."
104,"readers should review and consider the factors discussed in â€œ risk factors â€ of this annual report , along with various disclosures in our press releases , stockholder reports , and other filings with the securities and exchange commission . all such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report . you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements . we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in the events , conditions , or circumstances on which any such statement is based . overview we are a short-to-medium haul truckload carrier of general commodities with corporate headquarters in north liberty , iowa . we provide nationwide transportation services to major shippers spanning from washington to florida and new england to california as well as parts of canada . we offer primarily asset-based transportation services in the dry van truckload market and also offer temperature-controlled transportation services and non asset-based freight brokerage services although such temperature-controlled and non asset-based services are not material sources of revenue . we provide these transportation services using predominately company-owned and leased revenue equipment . we also obtain additional capacity through the use of independent contractor tractors , although this source of capacity is not significant to our overall operations . we generally earn revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered . we believe the keys to success are maintaining high levels of customer service and safety . 21 management believes achieving high levels of customer service and safety is predicated on the availability of late-model equipment and experienced drivers . management believes that our service standards , safety record , and equipment availability have made us a core carrier for many of our major customers . we achieve operating efficiencies and cost controls through equipment utilization , which is optimized by a common information system platform , a fleet of late model equipment , industry-leading driver to non-driver employee ratio , and effective management of fixed and variable operating costs . the demand for freight services was moderate in 2013 and strong in 2014 as demand for freight services generally outpaced industry capacity in 2014 and into early 2015. the demand for freight services generally slowed in the later months of 2015 compared to 2014 levels . industry capacity continues to be hindered by an insufficient quantity of qualified drivers , which is further challenged by various regulations that reduce drivers ' availability . industry regulations , including the thirty minute break within the first eight hours of driving requirement that became effective july 1 , 2013 , have and will continue to reduce driver utilization compared to previous periods . further , conformity to the eld requirement will continue to reduce overall industry capacity and driver availability . we can not predict how future regulations will impact driver utilization . an industry shortage of qualified drivers , in conjunction with reduced driver utilization , creates a favorable rate environment , but also a general industry trend toward increased driver wages to attract and retain qualified drivers . we can not currently predict how long this volatility will continue or its future impact . competition for drivers , which has historically been intense , has recently escalated due to higher demand for freight services and decreasing numbers of qualified drivers in the industry , and we have experienced increased difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers . we continue to explore new strategies to attract and retain qualified drivers . we hire the majority of our drivers with at least six to nine months of over-the-road experience and safe driving records . in order to attract and retain experienced drivers who understand the importance of customer service , we have sought to solidify our position as an industry leader in driver compensation in our operating markets . we implemented increases to our driver pay package in late 2014 and early 2015 , raising driver compensation , on average , by approximately 13 % . our new driver pay package includes future pay increases based on years of continued service to us and increased rates for accident-free miles of operation . we believe this compensation increase solidified our leadership position in terms of driver pay within the industry and rewards our drivers for years of service with safe operating mileage benchmarks which are critical to our operational and financial performance . containment of fuel cost continues to be one of management 's top priorities as fuel expense , at approximately 16.8 % of operating revenues at december 31 , 2015 , is our highest cost after salaries , wages and benefits to our drivers and other employees . average doe diesel fuel prices for 2013 through 2015 were , $ 3.92 , $ 3.81 , and $ 2.69 respectively . the average price per gallon in 2016 , through february 24 , 2016 , was $ 2.05 . although the average price per gallon in 2015 is the lowest it has been since 2009 , we can not predict what fuel prices will be throughout 2016. we are not able to pass through all fuel price increases through fuel surcharge agreements with customers due to tractor idling time , along with empty and out-of-route miles . therefore , our operating income is negatively impacted with increased net fuel costs ( fuel expense less fuel surcharge revenue ) in a rising fuel environment and is positively impacted in a declining fuel environment . we continue to manage and implement fuel initiative strategies that we believe will effectively manage fuel costs . story_separator_special_tag as a result of the foregoing , our operating ratio ( operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue ) was 84.9 % during the year ended december 31 , 2014 , compared to 80.7 % during the year ended december 31 , 2013 . net income increased $ 14.3 million ( 20.2 % ) , to $ 84.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2014 , from $ 70.6 million during the 2013 period as a result of the net effects discussed above . 26 inflation and fuel cost most of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive , with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations . during the past three years , inflation has been fairly modest with its impacts mostly related to revenue equipment prices , tire prices and compensation paid to drivers . innovations in equipment technology , epa mandated new engine emission requirements and driver comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices . we historically have limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts . we also continue to update our fleet with more fuel-efficient , epa emission-compliant late-model engines which are more expensive than tractors that were previously purchased with engines meeting 2010 epa requirements . general improvement of economic conditions and the imbalance of industry supply and demand for freight services in recent years have allowed certain rate increases , although the rate increases received have significantly lagged the increases in depreciation expense per year due to increased prices paid for new revenue equipment over the same period . in addition to inflation , significant fluctuations in fuel prices can adversely affect our operating results and profitability . we have attempted to limit the effects of increases in fuel prices through certain cost control efforts and our fuel surcharge program . we impose fuel surcharges on substantially all accounts . although we historically have been able to pass through most long-term increases in fuel prices and operating taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates , these arrangements generally do not fully protect us from short-term fuel price increases and also may prevent us from receiving the full benefit of any fuel price decreases . additionally , we are not able to recover fuel surcharge on empty miles , out of route miles , or fuel used in idling . liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment . historically , except for acquisitions , we have been debt-free , funding revenue equipment purchases with cash flow provided by operating activities and sales of equipment . our primary source of liquidity is cash flow provided by operating activities . we entered into a line of credit during the fourth quarter of 2013 , described below , to partially finance an acquisition , including the payoff of debt we assumed . our primary source of liquidity during 2015 was cash flow generated from operating activities , although we maintained our line of credit to provide assistance with additional cash requirements , if necessary , to fund capital expenditures . during 2015 , we were able to fund revenue equipment purchases with cash flows provided by operating activities and sales of equipment as well as eliminate the outstanding balance on our line of credit . we had no outstanding borrowings at december 31 , 2015. on november 11 , 2013 , we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank , national association , ( the â€œ bank â€ ) . pursuant to the credit agreement , the bank provided a five-year , $ 250.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit , which was used to assist in the repayment of all debt acquired at the time of acquisition , and which may be used for future working capital , equipment financing , and general corporate purposes . the bank 's commitment decreased to $ 200.0 million on november 1 , 2015 , and will decrease to $ 175.0 million on november 1 , 2016 through october 31 , 2018. the credit agreement is unsecured , with a negative pledge against all assets of our consolidated group , except for debt associated with permitted acquisitions , new purchase-money debt and capital lease obligations as described in the credit agreement . the credit agreement matures on october 31 , 2018 , subject to the ability of heartland express , inc. of iowa ( the â€œ borrower â€ ) to terminate the commitment at any time at no additional cost to the borrower . borrowings under the credit agreement can either be , at the borrower 's election , ( i ) one-month or three-month libor ( index ) plus 0.625 % , floating , or ( ii ) prime ( index ) plus 0 % , floating . the weighted average variable annual percentage rate is not calculated since there were no amounts borrowed and outstanding at december 31 , 2015 . there is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the line of credit under the credit agreement at 0.0625 % , due monthly . the credit agreement contains customary financial covenants including , but not limited to , ( i ) a maximum adjusted leverage ratio of 2 , measured quarterly , ( ii ) required minimum net income of $ 1.00 , measured quarterly , ( iii ) required minimum tangible net worth of $ 200 million , measured quarterly , and ( iv ) limitations on other indebtedness and liens . the credit agreement also includes customary events of default , conditions , representations and warranties , and indemnification provisions . we were in compliance with the respective financial covenants during 2015 . operating cash flow for 2015 was $ 190.5 million compared to $ 172.5 million during the same period of 2014 . this was primarily a result of net income ( excluding non-cash depreciation , changes in deferred taxes
","The annual report emphasizes the importance of reviewing risk factors and forward-looking statements, cautioning against undue reliance on them. The company, a short-to-medium haul truckload carrier based in North Liberty, Iowa, provides nationwide transportation services primarily in the dry van truckload market, with additional offerings in temperature-controlled transport and freight brokerage. Revenue is primarily generated based on miles per load delivered. The company has experienced moderate demand for freight services in 2013, strong demand in 2014, and a slowdown in late 2015, with industry capacity hindered by a shortage of qualified drivers and regulatory challenges. In response to increased competition for drivers, the company raised driver compensation by approximately 13% in late 2014 and early 2015. Fuel expenses accounted for about 16.8% of operating revenues as of December 31, 2015, with average diesel prices dropping from $3.92 in 2013 to $2.69 in 2015. The operating ratio was 84.9% in 2014, up from 80.7% in 2013, while net income increased by 20.2% to $84.8 million in 2014. The company has historically funded equipment purchases through cash flow and maintained a $250 million line of credit, which decreased to $200 million in November 2015. "

giving effect to the exchange , from june 1 , 2018 through march 30 , 2019. all annual periods presented prior to the effective date of the exchange are comprised solely of the results of champion holdings and all annual periods presented subsequent to fiscal 2019 are comprised solely of the results of the company . industry and company outlook in recent years , manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the united states , including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups , such as the population over 65 years of age , the population of first-time home buyers , and the population of households earning less than $ 50,000 per year . more recently , we see a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of adus and urban to rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns and protocols , as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options . we intend to capitalize on these trends and drivers to grow our business over the medium to long-term . we believe that there is an opportunity for continued manufactured and modular construction market with medium term expansion driven by the foregoing trends and demand drivers , as well as construction labor shortages in certain regions ( which tend to adversely and disproportionally impact supply and cost of site-built homes when compared to manufactured housing ) and increased affordability of factory-built homes relative to site-built homes . for fiscal 2020 , approximately 76 % of the company 's u.s. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the federal hud code construction standard in the u.s. according to data reported by mhi , hud code industry home shipments were 97,553 ; 93,265 and 90,729 units ( excluding fema units ) during fiscal 2020 , 2019 , and 2018 , respectively . industry shipments of hud-code fema units were 112 and 4,315 in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively . there were no industry shipments of hud code fema units in fiscal 2020 or 2019. based on industry data , the company 's u.s. wholesale market share of hud code homes sold was 16.5 % , 16.6 % , 13.9 % in fiscal 2020 , 2019 , and 2018. annual shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 hud code manufactured homes were shipped , the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. while shipments of hud code manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years , manufactured housing 's most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually . for fiscal 2020 , approximately 17 % of the company 's u.s. manufacturing sales were generated from the sale of modular homes . the company measures and reports on u.s. modular market share three months in arrears . industry shipments of modular homes in the u.s. of 14,690 during the twelve months ended december 31 , 2019 was 5.4 % lower than the 15,530 units shipped in the comparable period of calendar year 2018. the company 's modular market share during these periods was 13.9 % and 13.1 % , respectively . modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009. covid-19 pandemic the outbreak of covid-19 has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization and continues to spread in the united states and canada . the covid-19 pandemic poses the risk that the company or its employees , suppliers , customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time , including as a result of employee health and safety concerns , shutdowns , shelter in place orders , travel restrictions and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities . in response to dynamics brought on by covid-19 , the company has prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees and customers . skyline champion has carefully managed expenses by reducing non-essential spending and furloughing certain employees with many now taking advantage of benefits provided by the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security act ( â€œ cares act â€ ) . beginning in march 2020 , the company temporarily idled several of its manufacturing facilities due to stay-at-home orders , supplier disruptions , and a decline in demand resulting from these restrictions as well as the temporary closure of some of the company 's independent retailers . upon initial shelter-in-place orders , skyline champion rolled out a temporary emergency sick pay policy which allowed limited pay for employees impacted by covid-19 . during april 2020 , the company reduced its workforce by 5 % , to 24 approximately 6,600 employees and furloughed many more employees due to government stay-at-home orders or reduced demand . during this time , the company chose to continue to pay its share of the costs associated with providing uninterrupted health care benefits to its furloughed employees . story_separator_special_tag selling ,

106,"for example , the timing of capital budget authorizations for our commercial customers can affect when these companies can procure it products and services . the fiscal year-ends of u.s. public sector customers vary for those in the federal government space and those in the state and local government and educational institution ( â€œ sled â€ ) space . we generally see an increase in our second quarter sales related to customers in the u.s. sled sector and in our third quarter sales related to customers in the federal government space as these customers close out their budgets for their fiscal year . further , our canadian business may see seasonal increases in the first quarter due to canadian sled budgets being closed out in the first quarter . we may also experience variability in our gross profit and gross profit margin as a result of changes in the various vendor programs we participate in and its effect on the amount of vendor consideration we receive from a particular vendor , which may be impacted by a number of events outside of our control . as such , the results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year . 32 a substantial portion of our business is dependent on sales of cisco , hp inc. and microsoft products as well as products purchased from other vendors including apple , dell , hewlett packard enterprise , ingram micro , lenovo , and tech data . our top sales of products by manufacturer as a percent of our gross billed sales were as follows for the periods presented : replace_table_token_7_th our planned operating expenditures each quarter are based in large part on sales forecasts for the quarter . if our sales do not meet expectations in any given quarter , our operating results for the quarter may be materially adversely affected . our narrow margins may magnify the impact of these factors on our operating results . management regularly reviews our operating performance using a variety of financial and non-financial metrics including sales , shipments , margin , vendor consideration , advertising expense , personnel costs , account executive productivity , accounts receivable aging , inventory turnover , liquidity and cash resources . our management monitors the various metrics against goals and budgets , and makes necessary adjustments intended to enhance our performance . general economic conditions have an effect on our business and results of operations across all of our segments . if economic growth in the u.s. , canada and other countries slows or declines , government , consumer and business spending rates could be significantly reduced . these developments could also increase the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable from our customers . the economic climate in the u.s. , canada and elsewhere could have an impact on the rate of information technology spending of our current and potential customers , which would impact our business and results of operations . these factors affect sales of our products , sales cycles , adoption rates of new technologies and level of price competition . we continue to focus our efforts on cost controls , competitive pricing strategies , and driving higher margin service and solution sales . we also continue to make selective investments in our sales force personnel , service and solutions capabilities and it infrastructure and tools in an effort to meet vendor program requirements and to position us for enhanced productivity and future growth . strategic developments acquisitions stratiform on december 29 , 2016 , we completed the acquisition of stratiform , inc. for c $ 2.1 million in cash ( or $ 1.6 million ) . stratiform is an industry-leading provider of cloud it solutions that include consulting , professional and managed services to clients across canada . as part of the stratiform acquisition , we agreed to pay certain contingent earn-out consideration related to years ending december 31 , 2017 , 2018 and 2019 ( each year the â€œ measurement period â€ ) , payable 90 days in arrears following each measurement period . as of december 31 , 2016 , we have estimated that the fair value of contingent consideration to be paid throughout the earn-out periods to be approximately $ 0.7 million , of which we have included $ 0.3 million in each of â€œ accrued expenses and other current liabilities â€ and â€œ other long-term liabilities â€ on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 , 2016. systemax on december 1 , 2015 , we completed the acquisition of certain business to business ( b2b ) assets of systemax 's north american technology group ( natg ) for $ 14 million in cash . we acquired the right to hire approximately 400 b2b sales representatives located across the united states and canada , all rights to the natg b2b customer list , certain b2b customer and vendor contracts , trademarks and other intellectual property rights including the tigerdirect brand , and certain fixed assets and equipment . we did not acquire cash , accounts receivable , inventory or assume trade payables in connection with the transaction . also at closing , the parties entered into a transition services agreement to facilitate an orderly transition of the purchased assets . we assumed certain leases and entered into certain subleases for office space where the b2b sales representatives currently work . in january 2016 , we exercised an option in our purchase agreement and paid $ 0.4 million related to our purchase of additional customer list information , which was recorded as an increase to goodwill associated with the systemax assets acquisition . as of december 31 , 2016 , we have finalized the accounting for the systemax asset acquisition and the related purchase price allocation with no changes to the initial accounting and purchase price allocation recorded as of december 31 , 2015 . story_separator_special_tag 36 some of our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements ( â€œ eas â€ ) . under eas , customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year , regardless of changes to their employee base . customers are charged an annual true-up fee for changes in the number of users over the year . with most eas , our vendors will transfer the license and invoice the customer directly , paying us an agency fee or commission on these sales . we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount . in certain instances , we invoice the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item . our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer . when a customer order contains multiple deliverables such as hardware , software and services which are delivered at varying times , we determine whether the delivered items can be considered separate units of accounting as prescribed under asc 605-25 , revenue recognition , multiple-element arrangement . for arrangements with multiple units of accounting , arrangement consideration is allocated among the units of accounting , where separable , based on their relative selling price . relative selling price is determined based on vendor-specific objective evidence , if it exists . otherwise , third-party evidence of selling price is used , when it is available , and in circumstances when neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence of selling price is available , management 's best estimate of selling price is used . revenue from professional services is either recognized as incurred for services billed at an hourly rate or recognized using the proportional performance method for services provided at a fixed fee . revenue for data center services , including internet connectivity , web hosting , server co-location and managed services , is recognized over the period the service is performed . sales are reported net of estimated returns and allowances , discounts , mail-in rebate redemptions and credit card chargebacks . if the actual sales returns , allowances , discounts , mail-in rebate redemptions or credit card chargebacks are greater than estimated by management , additional expense may be incurred . vendor consideration . we receive vendor consideration from our vendors in the form of cooperative marketing allowances , volume incentive rebates and other programs to support our marketing of their products . most of our vendor consideration is accrued , when performance required for recognition is completed , as an offset to cost of sales in accordance with asc 605-50 , customer payments and incentives since such funds are not a reimbursement of specific , incremental , identifiable costs incurred by us in selling the vendors ' products . at the end of any given period , billed or accrued receivables related to our vendor consideration are included in our â€œ accounts receivable , net of allowances . â€ any change by the vendors of their program requirements or any changes in estimates of performance under such programs could have a material impact to our results of operations . goodwill and intangible assets . goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are carried at historical cost , subject to write-down , as needed , based upon an impairment analysis that we perform annually , or sooner if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not result in an impairment loss . we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of october 1 of each year . goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value . events that may create an impairment include , but are not limited to , significant and sustained decline in our stock price or market capitalization , significant underperformance of operating units and significant changes in market conditions . changes in estimates of future cash flows or changes in market values could result in a write-down of our goodwill in a future period . if an impairment loss results from any impairment analysis as described above , such loss will be recorded as a pre-tax charge to our operating income . goodwill is allocated to various reporting units , which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment . at october 1 , 2016 , our goodwill resided in our abreon , commercial technology , public sector and canada reporting units . goodwill impairment testing is a two-step process . step one involves comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount . if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount , there is no impairment and no further testing is required . if the reporting unit 's carrying amount is greater than the fair value , the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment , if any . step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets , excluding goodwill , of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one . the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill . if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill , an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference . we performed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment as of october 1 , 2016. our annual impairment analysis excluded goodwill associated with the stratiform acquisition made during the fourth quarter of 2016 , as its purchase price allocation was completed subsequent to
","The timing of capital budget authorizations significantly impacts procurement for commercial customers, particularly in the U.S. public sector, where fiscal year-ends vary. Sales typically increase in Q2 for state and local government (SLED) customers and in Q3 for federal government customers, with Canadian SLED budgets closing in Q1. A substantial portion of sales relies on products from major vendors like Cisco, HP Inc., and Microsoft, with vendor consideration affecting gross profit margins. Economic conditions in the U.S. and Canada can influence IT spending, impacting sales cycles and price competition. The company has made strategic acquisitions, including Stratiform for CAD 2.1 million (USD 1.6 million) in 2016 and Systemax for USD 14 million in 2015, enhancing its cloud IT solutions and B2B capabilities. Revenue recognition practices vary, with professional services billed hourly or recognized over time, while vendor consideration is accrued as an offset to sales costs. Goodwill and intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment, with significant declines in stock price or market conditions potentially triggering write-downs. As of October 1, 2016, goodwill was allocated across various reporting units, with impairment testing conducted to ensure fair value exceeds carrying amounts."

( â€œ legacy hyliion â€ ) , and consummated the merger contemplated by the business combination , with legacy hyliion surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of tortoisecorp . as a result of the business combination , we became a nyse listed company . our mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry . our goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and the ghg emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest tco . our solutions utilize our proprietary battery systems , control software and data analytics , combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics , to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment , in the case of our hybrid system , or fully replace , in the case of the hypertruck erx system , traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance . by reducing both ghg emissions and tco , our environmentally conscious solutions support our customers ' pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives . we are currently developing two electrified powertrain systems for long-haul class 8 commercial vehicles : our hybrid system and our hypertruck erx system . our hybrid system has been installed in low volumes on our initial customers ' commercial vehicles . across the customer installations and over the entire hyliion fleet we have accumulated millions of real world road miles on class 8 commercial vehicles . our hybrid system can either be installed on a new vehicle during assembly and prior to entering fleet service or retrofit to an existing in-service vehicle . our hypertruck erx system is in the development stage with vehicles being built for testing and validation . our hypertruck erx system 's design and technology leverages the experience and operating data from our hybrid system to replace the traditional diesel powertrain installed in new vehicles . our hypertruck erx system will offer commercial vehicle owners and operators a net carbon negative electrified powertrain option for class 8 commercial vehicles , when using certain renewable natural gas ( â€œ rng â€ ) . our initial expected deliveries of our hypertruck erx systems to customers are designed to have their batteries recharged with compressed natural gas ( â€œ cng â€ ) . cng fueled recharging is preferable due to both the current comparable cost of fuels and existing availability of cng refueling infrastructure . class 8 commercial vehicles can currently be refueled with cng through existing , geographically diverse and third-party accessible natural gas refueling stations established across north america . globally , rng , cng and liquefied natural gas ( â€œ lng â€ ) are used widely for land-based transport and trucking and hyliion believes there are established , geographically diverse and third-party accessible refueling stations available in certain areas in which hyliion expects it may sell its electrified powertrain solutions in the future . we believe there is opportunity for adoption of our electrified powertrain solutions across europe . this existing and accessible refueling infrastructure will significantly reduce the buildout time and cost required to utilize our hypertruck erx system as compared to other proposed potential electrified solutions . see â€œ risk factors â€” our future growth is dependent upon the commercial trucking industry 's willingness to adopt alternative fuel , hybrid and electric vehicles . â€ our hybrid and hypertruck erx systems are designed to be installed on most major class 8 commercial vehicles , which gives our customers the flexibility to continue using their preferred vehicle brands and maintain their existing fleet maintenance and operations strategies . our early hybrid system deployments include leaders in the transportation and logistics sector . we are focusing its initial marketing efforts on large fleet operators as well as companies committed to reducing the overall environmental impact and fuel costs of their owned and operated trucking fleets . 41 recent developments none . comparability of financial information our historical operations and statements of assets and liabilities may not be comparable to our

consummated the merger contemplated by the business combination , with legacy hyliion surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of tortoisecorp . immediately prior to the closing of the business combination , all shares of issued and outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into shares of legacy hyliion common stock and all outstanding convertible note payables plus accrued interest converted into shares of legacy hyliion common stock at the discount rates set forth in the original agreements . upon the consummation of the business combination , each share of legacy hyliion common stock issued and outstanding was cancelled and converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration . story_separator_special_tag if factors change , and we utilize different assumptions , share-based compensation cost on future award grants may differ significantly from share-based compensation cost recognized on past award grants . higher volatility and longer expected terms result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant . future share-based compensation cost will increase to the extent that we grant additional share-based awards to employees and non-employees . if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities , we may be required to accelerate any remaining unearned share-based compensation cost or incur incremental cost . share-based compensation cost affects our research and development expenses and selling , general and administrative expenses . based on our fair value of common stock of $ 16.48 at december 31 , 2020 and our estimated fair value of common stock of $ 0.34 at december 31 , 2019 , the aggregative intrinsic value of the vested and unvested

of forfeiture adjustments during 2020 and 2019 was insignificant . in future periods , we expect share-based compensation to increase , due in part to our existing unrecognized share-based compensation and as we issue additional share-based awards to continue to attract and retain employees . as of december 31 , 2020 , there was $ 0.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based payments , which is expected to be recognized over an average period of 2.6 years . 47 income taxes we recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets and

substantial changes in our ownership may result in an annual limit on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized in the future to offset our taxable income . generally , this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50 % within a three-year period . we have completed such analysis and determined that such ownership change occurred in 2017. this will limit the usage of our 2017 and prior year net operating losses , and will cause $ 2.0 million of such losses to expire unused , regardless of future taxable income . no other such ownership changes have occurred through december 31 , 2020. due to this , as well as our overall profitability estimate as noted above , we have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets . our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense . there was no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions and no amounts have been recognized in our statements of operations for the years ended december 31 , 2020 , and 2019. emerging growth company status section 102 ( b ) ( 1 ) of the jobs act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies ( that is , those that have not had a securities act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the exchange act ) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards . the jobs act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable . we elected not to opt out of such extended transition period , which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies , we , as an emerging growth company , can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard , until such time we are no longer considered to be an emerging growth company . at times , we may elect to early adopt a new or revised standard . see note 2 of the accompanying audited financial statements for the recent accounting pronouncements adopted and the recent accounting pronouncements not yet

","Hyliion, a Delaware corporation based in Cedar Park, Texas, became a publicly listed company on October 1, 2020, following a merger with Tortoise Acquisition Corp. This business combination allowed Hyliion to focus on providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles, aiming to reduce carbon intensity and greenhouse gas emissions while achieving the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). The company is developing two systems: a hybrid system, which has been installed in low volumes on initial customer vehicles, and the Hypertruck ERX system, currently in the testing phase. The hybrid system can be retrofitted to existing vehicles or installed in new ones, while the Hypertruck ERX aims to offer a net carbon-negative option using renewable natural gas (RNG). As of December 31, 2020, Hyliion reported a fair value of common stock at $16.48, with an intrinsic value of options totaling $113.8 million. The company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $82.2 million and state carryforwards of $12.5 million, which may be limited due to ownership changes. Hyliion has opted to retain its emerging growth company status, allowing it to defer compliance with certain financial accounting standards."

","The company incurs significant costs in acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials, including validation batches, alongside employee-related expenses such as salaries, benefits, travel, and share-based compensation for research and development staff. Compliance with regulatory requirements, facilities costs, and payments under third-party licensing agreements also contribute to these expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, with advance payments recorded as prepaid expenses. The companyâ€™s R&D expenses surged in 2019 due to the completion of Phase 3 clinical trials for the sulopenem program, increased personnel costs, and preparations for regulatory filings. The uncertainty surrounding the successful development and commercialization of oral sulopenem and sulopenem is notable, particularly due to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical trial outcomes, and regulatory approvals. For instance, sulopenem did not meet primary endpoints in several trials, including the Cuti and Uuti trials, although it demonstrated superiority in a specific patient population resistant to quinolones. Following discussions with the FDA, the company submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for oral sulopenem in late 2020, which was accepted for review in January 2021, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date set for July 25, 2021. The company acknowledges the inherent risks in achieving regulatory approval and the potential for unexpected clinical trial results."

","As of December 31, 2013, the company had incurred $40.5 million in research and development expenses related to its product candidates, gen-003 and gen-004, and expects to increase these expenses as it conducts ongoing and planned clinical trials. The total estimated costs for the two planned phase 2 clinical trials for gen-003 are approximately $25 million, while the costs for gen-004's phase 1 and planned phase 2a trials are expected to be around $8 million. The company completed its IPO in February 2014, which, along with existing cash and cash equivalents, is anticipated to fund operations through at least the end of 2015. However, it acknowledges the unpredictability of clinical trial costs and the need for additional funding to obtain marketing approval and commercialize its product candidates. In 2013, the company reported a net cash used in operating activities of $19.9 million, an increase from $12.7 million in 2012, primarily due to a net loss of $20.8 million. Financing activities provided $21 million in 2013, compared to $18.9 million in 2012, mainly from preferred stock sales and long-term debt issuance. The company has no products approved for sale and anticipates that revenue will remain less than expenses for the foreseeable future, leading to increasing losses as it seeks regulatory approvals and begins commercialization efforts."
111,"this asset is initially capitalized and included in other assets on the company 's consolidated balance sheet . the mortgage servicing rights are then amortized against noninterest income in proportion to , and over the period of , the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying mortgage servicing rights . there are a number of factors , however , that can affect the ultimate value of the mortgage servicing rights to the company , including the estimated prepayment speed of the loan and the discount rate used to present value the servicing right . for example , if the mortgage loan is prepaid , the company will receive fewer servicing fees , meaning that the present value of the mortgage servicing rights is less than the carrying value of those rights on the company 's balance sheet . therefore , in an attempt to reflect an accurate expected value to the company of the mortgage servicing rights , the company receives a valuation of its mortgage servicing rights from an independent third party . the independent third party 's valuation of the mortgage servicing rights is based on relevant characteristics of the company 's loan servicing portfolio , such as loan terms , interest rates and recent national prepayment experience , as well as current national market interest rate levels , market forecasts and other economic conditions . management , with the advice from its third party valuation firm , review the assumptions related to prepayment speeds , discount rates , and capitalized mortgage servicing income on a quarterly basis . changes are reflected in the following quarter 's analysis related to the mortgage servicing asset . in addition , based upon the independent third party 's valuation of the company 's mortgage servicing rights , management then establishes a valuation allowance by each strata , if necessary , to quantify the likely impairment of the value of the mortgage servicing rights to the company . the estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates are inherently uncertain , and different estimates could have a material impact on the company 's net income and results of operations . the valuation allowance is evaluated and adjusted quarterly by management to reflect changes in the fair value of the underlying mortgage servicing rights based on market 21 conditions . the accuracy of these estimates and assumptions by management and its third party can be directly tied back to the fact that management has not been required to record a valuation allowance through its income statement based upon the valuation of each stratum of serving rights . for more information regarding the estimates and calculations used to establish the alll and the value of mortgage servicing rights , please see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements provided herewith . 2016 in review the company experienced record earnings for 2016 , with net income over $ 11 million . the bank also reached a milestone of net income over $ 10 million though the company had reached it in 2015 on a consolidated basis . profitability improved due to the increased loan balances , new product offerings and continued strong asset quality . net loans grew by $ 73.5 million with asset size increasing by a slightly smaller $ 66.8 million . loans were funded by higher deposit levels , sales and maturities of investment securities and federal home loan bank borrowings . 2016 's net income grew by $ 1.3 million over 2015. improvement in net interest income , which was $ 3.4 million over 2015 , was the largest contributing factor . this was accomplished through higher loan balances and aided by the two prime rate increases in december 2015 and 2016. interest income benefited from those rate hikes more than the cost increase experienced in interest expense . while 2015 was similar in that loan growth fueled improved interest income , the rate increase was too late in the year to have much impact . interest expense actually decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to movement within deposits from interest bearing accounts to non-interest bearing due to the introduction of Â“secure checking , Â” a new demand deposit account offering . overall , 2015 's net interest income improved by $ 326 thousand over 2014. the performance of one of our newest offices , sylvania , ohio , which opened during the second half of 2014 , exceeded our expectations and contributed profitably within its first two years of operation . the company continues to focus on expansion and we opened our next office in indiana at the end of the first quarter 2016. our location is situated within huntertown but with a fort wayne address . in the fourth quarter of 2016 , we opened our bowling green , ohio office in a leased property which the bank renovated . the bank has been able to establish ties with the athletic department of bowling green state university and will begin offering a credit card to its alumni in 2017. we expect the offices to be a slight drag on earnings during 2017 as a result of start-up costs , with great potential for later years . a deposit strategy to revamp the bank 's deposit mix was begun in the later part of 2014. the strategy included offering a new checking account product line and discontinuing some of the older products . an emphasis was on realigning our products to provide value to our depositors while building revenue or decreasing costs to the bank . Â“secure checkingÂ” and Â“fm expressÂ” were two of the revamped or new product offerings . this contributed to the almost $ 600 thousand improvement in customer service fees and other service charges and fees in noninterest income during 2015. the focus remains on growing core deposits and offering additional services . story_separator_special_tag in comparing line items of the consolidated statements of income for years ended 2014 through 2016 , it can be seen where the company has been spending its time and the impact of the recession and slow recovery . this section will focus on the significant noninterest items that impacted the operations of the company . 29 the company has concerns with the increased costs associated with regulatory compliance such as the possible loss of revenue from new regulations stemming from the dodd-frank act . history has proven the concern is justified . one area of revenue impacted was overdraft fees . the bank has ended each of the last 3 years with a lower revenue stream from overdraft fees . this has occurred in spite of the addition of the new offices . each year , the number of checking accounts has increased along with the balances ; however average collected overdraft fees per account decreased . overdraft fees in 2016 and 2015 accounted for $ 2.4 million in noninterest income , compared to $ 2.5 million in 2014 and $ 2.7 million for 2013. the bank had made this an area of focus for 2015 as this revenue stream remains under intense regulator review . in 2015 , the bank adjusted its overdraft program and renamed it Â“courtesy pay.Â” courtesy pay establishes dynamic limits based on a customer 's behavior and likelihood of repayment . the bank has sought to better service the customer 's needs while decreasing the need for collections and improving profitability . at the current time , profitability has not been impacted and in 2016 it only slowed the amount of decrease . service charges on checking accounts also leveled off in 2016. excluding health savings accounts , service charges were up $ 120 thousand for 2015 and $ 208.7 thousand for 2014. this improvement is credited to the new checking accounts mentioned previously . the bank has long promoted the use of debit cards by its customers and continued that philosophy with the introduction of additional new products . 2016 revenue improved $ 122.4 thousand , 2015 revenue improved $ 142.9 thousand and 2014 revenue improved $ 250.5 from atm/debit card usage as compared to each of the respective prior years . the bank receives interchange revenue from each use by a customer of a bank issued atm/debit the card . in 2011 , this revenue stream was at risk of being reduced by the federal reserve regulation of the interchange fee . the establishment by the federal reserve of a tiered pricing for banks under $ 10 billion has helped to protect the profitability from such fees , although the concern remains as to how long this tiered pricing will remain in effect . while this revenue stream continues to improve with more depositors using electronic methods for purchasing , the expense attributable to card fraud has offset a portion of the revenue gain . further discussion can be found in the non-interest expense section regarding the net effect of debit card activity . noninterest income from net gain on sales of loans increased for 2016 after having decreased for both 2015 and 2014. the change may be related to the increase in rates after the long duration of the flat rate interest environment . the net gain on sale of loans is derived from sales of real estate loans into the secondary market . of these loan types , the bank sells 100 % of the residential loans and 90 % of the agricultural loans into the secondary market . gains of $ 683.7 and $ 204.0 thousand were recorded for residential an agricultural real estate respectively for 2016. gains of $ 559.6 and $ 140.8 thousand were recorded for residential and agricultural real estate respectively for 2015 compared to gains of $ 452.7 and $ 194.3 thousand respectively for 2014. in conjunction with these sales , the bank maintains servicing rights and those income amounts during all three years are included in the customer service fees line item and accounted for over $ 400 thousand in revenue for 2016 and 2015. the last line item in the noninterest income section is the net gain on sale of investments . the bank has taken advantage of this opportunity the last three years and expects to continue as long as the rates remain low and the yield curve is favorable to the transaction . the bank will not increase short-term gains at the sacrifice of long-term profitability . all of the sales of securities in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 of $ 85.7 , $ 47.0 and $ 57.9 million respectively were used to fund loan growth . this is a source of funds that will continue to be analyzed for use in the coming year . gains of $ 588 thousand were recorded for 2016 , $ 451 thousand for 2015 as compared to $ 494 thousand for 2014. customer service fees show an improvement of $ 271 thousand collected in 2016 as compared to 2015 . 2015 experienced an even higher increase in customer service fees of $ 623 thousand over 2014. almost $ 200 thousand can be attributed to classifying foreign atm fees out of service charges into miscellaneous fees in 2015. other fees included in this line item are the interchange fee mentioned previously , fees for wire activity , safe deposit box rent and profit on sales of checks to name a few . overall , noninterest income increased $ 580 thousand in 2016 preceded by a year where it had increased $ 604 thousand . some of the revenue may not be easily duplicated as it is dependent on economic and market conditions to provide the opportunity . however , the increased revenue amounts from deposit and loan services should continue to provide improved profitability in the future . management expects gains on sales to continue in the near term . non-interest expense noninterest expense increased
","In 2016, the company achieved record earnings with a net income exceeding $11 million, marking a $1.3 million increase from 2015. This growth was driven by a $73.5 million increase in net loans and a $66.8 million rise in asset size, supported by higher deposit levels and federal home loan bank borrowings. The net interest income rose by $3.4 million, benefiting from two prime rate increases in December 2015 and 2016. The bank's overdraft fees generated $2.4 million in noninterest income in 2016, down from $2.5 million in 2015 and $2.7 million in 2014, despite an increase in checking accounts. The bank's new checking account products contributed to a $600,000 rise in customer service fees in 2015, with further improvements in 2016. . The bank sold $85.7 million in securities in 2016, generating gains of $588 thousand, while noninterest income overall increased by $580 thousand. The company continues to focus on expansion, opening new offices in Indiana and Bowling Green, Ohio, although these may initially impact earnings due to start-up costs. Management regularly reviews the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, which are influenced by factors such as prepayment speeds and discount rates, to ensure accurate financial reporting."
112,"oil and natural gas prices and activity are cyclical and volatile , and this market volatility has a significant impact on our operating results . 22 while our fluids systems revenue potential is driven by a number of factors including those described above , rig count data remains the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity . average north american rig count data for the last three years is as follows : replace_table_token_3_th _ source : baker hughes company during 2019 , u.s. rig count steadily declined , exiting the year at 805 active rigs , a 26 % decline from the end of 2018. during march 2020 , oil prices collapsed due to geopolitical events along with the worldwide effects of the covid-19 pandemic . as a result , average u.s. rig count declined 52 % in 2020 from 2019. after reaching a low of 244 in mid-august , the u.s. rig count has since increased to 397 as of february 19 , 2021. the canada rig count reflects normal seasonality for this market , with the highest rig count levels generally observed in the first quarter of each year , prior to spring break-up . we anticipate that market activity will continue to improve from current levels , although the ongoing impacts of the covid-19 pandemic and an uncertain economic environment make the timing and pace of recovery difficult to predict . outside of north america land markets , drilling activity is generally more stable as this drilling activity is based on longer-term economic projections and multi-year drilling programs , which typically reduces the impact of short-term changes in commodity prices on overall drilling activity . however , operations in several countries in the emea region experienced activity disruptions and project delays beginning in march 2020 and continuing into 2021 , driven by government-imposed restrictions on movements of personnel , quarantines of staffing , and logistical limitations as a result of the covid-19 pandemic . we expect these disruptions and project delays will continue to impact international activity levels in the near-term , and while we anticipate a general improvement in customer activity during 2021 , the impact from the duration and magnitude of the ongoing health pandemic and related government responses are very difficult to predict . in response to the 2020 market changes and reduced demand for our products and services as a result of the decline in oil prices and the covid-19 pandemic , we initiated a number of actions late in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing throughout 2020 aimed at conserving cash and protecting our liquidity , including : the implementation of cost reduction programs , including workforce reductions , employee furloughs , the suspension of the company 's matching contributions to its u.s. defined contribution plan , and temporary salary reductions effective april 1 , 2020 for a significant portion of u.s. employees , including a 15 % cut to the salaries paid to executive officers ( with a further 10 % cut for the ceo effective august 12 , 2020 ) and the annual cash retainers paid to all non-employee members of the board of directors ; the initiation of additional actions to further reduce the operational footprint of the fluids systems business in the u.s. , to better align our cost structure with the lower market activity levels ; and the elimination of all non-critical capital investments . as part of the cost reduction programs , we reduced our global employee base by approximately 650 ( 30 % ) in 2020. in 2020 , we recognized $ 29.2 million of total charges , including $ 28.6 million in fluids systems consisting of $ 11.7 million for the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation losses related to our exit from brazil , $ 10.3 million for inventory write-downs , $ 3.5 million for severance and other costs , and $ 3.0 million in fixed asset impairments . while we have taken certain actions to reduce our workforce and cost structure , our business contains high levels of fixed costs , including significant facility and personnel expenses . we continue to evaluate under-performing areas as well as opportunities to further enable a more efficient and scalable cost structure . in the absence of a longer-term increase in activity levels , we may incur future charges related to further cost reduction efforts or potential asset impairments , which may negatively impact our future results . segment overview fluids systems - our fluids systems segment , which generated 72 % of consolidated revenues for 2020 , provides drilling , completion , and stimulation fluids products and related technical services to customers for oil , natural gas , and geothermal projects primarily in north america and emea , as well as certain countries in asia pacific and latin america . despite the continuing effects of covid-19 impacting the international customer activity , expansion outside of the north america land markets , including the penetration of international oil companies ( â€œ iocs â€ ) and national oil companies ( â€œ nocs â€ ) , 23 remains a key element of our fluids systems strategy , which has historically helped to stabilize segment revenues while north american oil and natural gas exploration activities have fluctuated significantly . revenues from ioc and noc customers represented approximately 40 % of fluids systems segment revenues for 2020 compared to approximately 33 % for 2019. industrial solutions - our industrial solutions segment , which generated 28 % of consolidated revenues for 2020 , provides engineered composite matting system rentals utilized for temporary worksite access , along with related site construction and services to customers in various markets including electrical transmission & distribution , e & p , pipeline , renewable energy , petrochemical , construction and other industries , primarily in the united states and europe . we also sell our manufactured composite mats to customers around the world . story_separator_special_tag operating income the fluids systems segment generated operating income of $ 3.8 million for 2019 compared to $ 40.3 million for 2018. fluids systems operating income for 2019 includes an $ 11.4 million non-cash impairment of goodwill and $ 7.3 million of total charges associated with facility closures and related exit costs , inventory write-downs , and severance costs , as well as the modification of the company 's retirement policy . operating income for 2018 included $ 5.0 million of total charges associated 31 with severance costs , the kenedy , texas facility fire , and expenses related to the upgrade and conversion of a drilling fluids facility into a completion fluids facility . excluding these charges , the decrease in operating income includes a $ 10.8 million decline from north american operations and a $ 11.8 million decline from international operations . this decline in operating income is primarily attributable to the decreases in revenues described above . industrial solutions revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following : replace_table_token_11_th rental and service revenues decreased 18 % to $ 143.3 million for 2019 compared to $ 174.8 million for 2018 , which includes a decrease in revenues from e & p customers of approximately $ 35.0 million , resulting from lower u.s. drilling and pressure pumping activity and weakness in natural gas prices . this decline was partially offset by an increase of approximately $ 3.5 million in non-e & p rental and service revenues . revenues from product sales increased 1 % and typically fluctuate based on the timing of mat orders from customers . operating income the industrial solutions segment generated operating income of $ 47.5 million for 2019 compared to $ 60.6 million for 2018 , primarily attributable to the change in revenues as described above . the benefit from the higher contribution of product sales revenue in 2019 was offset by lower average rental pricing primarily from the increase in non-e & p rental activity as well as costs associated with additional personnel to support our strategic growth initiatives . corporate office corporate office expenses increased $ 3.5 million to $ 40.9 million for 2019 compared to $ 37.4 million for 2018. this increase was primarily driven by $ 3.4 million of charges associated with the february 2019 retirement policy modification , as discussed in note 12. the remaining change primarily reflects a $ 3.2 million increase in professional fees primarily related to our long-term strategic planning project and the cleansorb acquisition , as well as higher severance and personnel costs , partially offset by lower performance-based incentive compensation . in addition , 2018 included a $ 1.8 million charge associated with the retirement and transition of our former senior vice president , general counsel and chief administrative officer .

","Oil and natural gas prices are subject to significant volatility, impacting operational results. The average North American rig count has shown a downward trend, with the U.S. rig count decreasing by 26% to 805 rigs at the end of 2019, followed by a 52% drop in 2020, reaching a low of 244 rigs in August 2020, before rising to 397 by February 2021. In Canada, rig counts typically peak in Q1 before seasonal breaks. The COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events have disrupted international drilling activities, particularly in the EMEA region, leading to project delays. In response to reduced demand, the company implemented cost-saving measures, including a 30% workforce reduction (approximately 650 employees) and various salary cuts, resulting in total charges of $29.2 million in 2020. The fluids systems segment, which accounted for 72% of consolidated revenues in 2020, generated $3.8 million in operating income, down from $40.3 million in 2018, while the industrial solutions segment contributed 28% of revenues, with a decrease in rental and service revenues by 18% to $143.3 million.

% , respectively , of our revenue for the year ended december 31 , 2010. demand from the led market was very strong starting in 2010 continuing through mid-year 2011 , particularly in asia where there is a high concentration of customers that participate in the led market . demand for our products from the led market slowed in the second half of 2011 due to a slowdown in led chip sales which resulted in a build-up of inventory in the led supply chain . the decrease in demand from the led market was partially offset by the increased strength of the sos market . the demand for sapphire substrates from the led market is improving but excess sapphire capacity added in the marketplace has kept pricing low throughout 2012 and going into 2013. while we expect demand for led chips to continue to strengthen throughout 2013 with increased adoption of led lighting , it is difficult to predict how quickly the excess capacity will be absorbed and when the pricing environment will improve . demand for our products from the sos market increased considerably in 2012. however , there is some seasonality in that market which is centered around the introduction of new smartphone models so we expect orders to slow in the first half of 2013 with growth resuming in the second half of 2013. we currently depend on a small number of suppliers for certain raw materials , components , services and equipment , including key materials such as aluminum oxide and certain furnace components . if the supply of 27 these components were to be disrupted or terminated , or if these suppliers were unable to supply the quantities of raw materials required , we may have difficulty in finding , or may be unable to find , alternative sources for these items . as a result , we may be unable to meet the demand for our products , which could have a material adverse impact on our business . we manage direct sales primarily from our bensenville , illinois offices . substantially all of our revenue is generated by our direct sales force and we expect this to continue in the future . we manufacture and ship our products from our facilities in the chicago metropolitan area and from our facility in penang , malaysia . we have approximately 237,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space in batavia , franklin park and bensenville , illinois and a 65,000 square foot facility in penang , malaysia , which processes sapphire grown by us in our illinois facilities into finished cores and wafers . our malaysia facility currently finishes the majority of our core production and can produce production volumes of polished wafers . in march 2012 , we acquired additional land in batavia , illinois to expand our crystal growth capacity . we have not yet determined when we will begin construction on this facility . financial operations revenue . story_separator_special_tag we also had higher revenue of $ 3.1 million from optical products due to increased sales of sapphire for sensor and instrumentation applications . during the second half of 2011 , demand from the led market weakened due to excess inventory in the supply chain . as a result , prices for our products declined . while demand for large diameter polished wafers was strong throughout 2011 , the prolonged weakness in the led market impacted pricing for this product in the fourth quarter as customers for this product accumulated excess inventory as well . gross profit . gross profit was $ 69.6 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 and $ 41.2 million for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , an increase of $ 28.4 million . the increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to higher revenue due to increased core pricing in the first half of 2011 and higher volume sales of polished wafers . general and administrative expenses . g & a expenses were $ 11.3 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 and $ 9.9 million for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , an increase of $ 1.4 million . our bad debt expense increased by $ 1.7 million as we made accommodations to certain key customers of our small diameter cores by agreeing to write off a portion of their accounts receivable balances . also , investor relations expense increased $ 728,000 , primarily due to increased outside support services and investor relations consulting , audit fees increased $ 84,000 , tax consulting expense increased $ 102,000 and executive travel expenses increased $ 111,000 , primarily due to increased frequency in travel outside the u.s. g & a expenses for the malaysia facility were also $ 202,000 higher as the facility began to incur g & a expenses starting in the third quarter of 2010. the g & a increases noted above were partially offset by a decrease of employee compensation costs of $ 1.8 million , resulting from a lower performance based bonus of $ 2.1 million , offset by an increase of $ 143,000 from annual salary increases and expenses associated with issuance and exercise of employee stock options and $ 158,000 of recruiting expenses . sales and marketing expenses . sales and marketing expenses were $ 1.7 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 and $ 1.3 million for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , an increase of $ 391,000. the 32 increase in sales and marketing expenses is attributable to additional employee compensation costs primarily due to annual salary increases , employee stock options expense and additional sales hires to support expansion as well as increased travel expense . research and development expenses . r & d expenses were $ 1.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 and $ 1.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , an increase of $ 727,000. the increase is attributable to higher employee compensation costs of $ 246,000 and an increase in spending on research projects of $ 458,000. other income ( expense ) . other expense was $ 118,000 for the year ended december 31 , 2011 and other income $ 346,000 for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , a decrease in other income of $ 464,000. the decrease was primarily due to a $ 106,000 decrease in interest income on lower investment balances as well as a $ 350,000 realized loss on foreign currency translation . income tax expenses . income tax expenses were $ 16.5 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 , as our effective tax rate was 30.3 % for the year . due to our tax net operating loss position , there were no income taxes for the year ended december 31 , 2010. during the year ended december 31 , 2011 , management concluded that based on the current level of sustainable profitability that generates taxable income , that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realizable . with the release of the valuation allowance , we began recording federal and certain state and non-u.s. income taxes attributable to the fiscal year 's pre-tax income at the statutory rates adjusted for various tax benefits that lower

Cost of sales remained flat in 2019, with a 3% increase on a constant dollar basis, while as a percentage of net sales, it decreased from 68.3% in 2018 to 67.3% in 2019. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose by $133 million (17%) in 2019, influenced by restructuring charges ($60 million) and a settlement agreement ($59 million). The adjusted tax rate, which excludes the impact of special items, provides insight into the core business's tax expenses. Overall, the company believes that its calculations of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted EPS are consistently applied across periods, offering a reliable comparison of performance."

include sales of packaging , printing and plastic products , decreased 1 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 , driven by an increase in the sales of printing and packaging products of 3 % offset by a decrease in sales of plastic card products of 11 % . the company 's technology sales , services and licensing revenues decreased 4 % in 2018 , as compared to 2017 , because of decreases in licensing royalties and recurring it services , which more than offsets a $ 260,000 increase in sales of digital authentication products . costs and expenses replace_table_token_2_th 22 costs of revenue sold , exclusive of depreciation and amortization includes all direct cost of the company 's printed products , including its packaging , printing and plastic id card sales , materials , direct labor , transportation and manufacturing facility costs . in addition , this category includes all direct costs associated with the company 's technology sales , services and licensing including hardware and software that are resold , third-party fees , and fees paid to inventors or others as a result of technology licenses or settlements , if any . costs of revenue increased 8 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 , primarily due to an increase in paperboard costs and outside service costs at our packaging division . sales , general and administrative compensation costs , decreased 4 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 , primarily due to the impact of an increase of approximately $ 289,000 in compensation costs sharing amounts recognized by the company in 2018 as compared to 2017. the cost sharing amounts relate to an intellectual property monetization program management arrangement the company entered into in november of 2016 , for which the company received funds to offset certain of its compensation expenses associated with the monetization program and is recognizing those funds received from a third party over the estimated service period of the monetization program . depreciation and amortization include the depreciation of machinery and equipment used for production , depreciation of office equipment and building and leasehold improvements , amortization of software , and amortization of acquired intangible assets such as customer lists , trademarks , non-competition agreements and patents , and internally developed patent assets . depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 9 % during 2018 , as compared to 2017 , primarily due to the write-off of the semiconductor patents during 2018 , in conjunction with the gain on extinguishment of liabilities described below . professional fees increased 75 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 , primarily due to an increase in legal fees associated with the company 's intellectual property litigation matters , and an

same period in 2017 primarily due to development costs related to the development of proprietary blockchain solutions for the company 's authentiguard product line . story_separator_special_tag the company also derives revenue from royalties from third parties which are typically based on licensees ' net sales of products that utilize the company 's technology , or on a per item usage of the technology on the customers ' printed products . the company recognizes license revenue at the time it is reported by the licensee . from time to time , the company generates license revenues through litigation settlements . for these , the company recognizes revenue upon the execution of the agreement , when collectability is reasonably assured , or upon receipt of the minimum upfront fee for term agreement renewals , and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met . certain of the company 's revenue arrangements provide for future royalties or additional required payments based on future licensee activities . additional royalties are recognized in revenue upon resolution of the related contingency provided that all revenue recognition criteria , as described above , have been met . amounts of additional royalties due under these license agreements , if any , can not be reasonably estimated by management . 26 goodwill - goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination . goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired . fasb asc topic 350 provides an entity with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount . if , after assessing the totality of events or circumstances , an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount , then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary . if the two-step impairment test is necessary , a fair-value-based test is applied at the reporting unit level , which is generally one level below the operating segment level . the test compares the fair value of an entity 's reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units . this test requires various judgments and estimates . the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using a market approach in combination with a discounted operating cash flow approach . impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the fair values of recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit . an adjustment to goodwill will be recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired . the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually in conjunction with preparation of its annual business plan , or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired . fasb asu 2010-28 modifies step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts . for those reporting units , an entity is required to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists . in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists , an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist . other intangible assets and patent application costs - other intangible assets consists of costs associated with the application for patents , acquisition of patents and contractual rights to patents and trade secrets associated with the company 's technologies . the company 's patents and trade secrets are generally for document anti-counterfeiting and anti-scanning technologies and processes that form the basis of the company 's document security business . patent application costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the patent , which generally approximates its legal life . in addition , intangible assets include customer lists and non-compete agreements obtained as a result of acquisitions . intangible asset amortization expense is classified as an operating expense . the company believes that the decision to incur patent costs is discretionary as the associated products or services can be sold prior to or during the application process . the company accounts for other intangible amortization as an operating expense , unless the underlying asset is directly associated with the production or delivery of a product . subsequent to acquisition of patents and trade secrets , legal and associated costs incurred in prosecuting alleged infringements of the patents will be recognized as expense when incurred . costs incurred to renew or extend the term of recognized intangible assets , including patent annuities and fees , and patent defense costs are expensed as incurred . to date , the amount of related amortization expense for other intangible assets directly attributable to revenue recognized is not material . contingent legal expenses - contingent legal fees are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that the related revenues are recognized . in instances where there are no recoveries from potential infringers , no contingent legal fees are paid ; however , the company may be liable for certain out of pocket legal costs incurred pursuant to the underlying legal services agreement that will be paid out from the proceeds from settlements or licenses that arise pursuant to an enforcement action , which will be expensed as legal fees in the period in which the payment of such fees is probable . any unamortized patent acquisition costs will be expensed in the period in which a conclusion is reached in an enforcement action that does not yield future royalties potential . share-based payments - we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation
","DSS Technology Management, Inc. (DSSTM) focuses on monetizing intellectual property assets through acquisitions and internal development of patents. The company merged with Lexington Technology Group in July 2013 and began international operations in January 2018 with its subsidiary, DSS Asia Limited, in Hong Kong. In December 2018, DSS acquired Guangzhou Hotapps Technology Ltd, which has two employees and a license to operate in China. For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, DSS reported revenues of approximately $18.5 million, a 1% decrease from 2017, with printed products sales declining by 1% due to an 11% drop in plastic card sales, despite a 3% increase in packaging and printing products. Technology sales decreased by 4%, influenced by lower licensing royalties, although digital authentication product sales rose by $260,000. Costs of revenue increased by 8%, primarily due to rising paperboard and service costs. Sales, general, and administrative compensation costs fell by 4%, while professional fees surged by 75% due to legal and consulting expenses related to intellectual property litigation and international expansion. Research and development costs rose by 38%, driven by blockchain solution development for the Authentiguard product line. The company also generates revenue from royalties based on licensees' net sales and recognizes license revenue upon reporting by the licensee. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and the company capitalizes patent application costs, amortizing them over their legal life. Overall, DSSTM's financial performance reflects challenges in revenue generation and increased operational costs, alongside strategic investments in technology and international markets."

impairment charge in future periods if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value . other than management 's internal projections of future cash flows , the primary assumptions used in the impairment tests were the weighted-average cost of capital and long-term growth rates . although the company 's cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying business , there are significant judgments in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to a reporting unit . there have been no impairment charges booked currently or in prior periods in which goodwill existed . indefinite lived intangible assets are also subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if indicators of impairment are identified . management judgment and assumptions are required in determining the underlying fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets . while the company believes the judgments and assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable and no impairment existed at december 31 , 2014 or december 31 , 2013 , different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and , therefore , impairment charges could be required , which could be material to the consolidated financial statements . the indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired as a result of the annual test prepared by management for either period presented . 23 refer to note 11 , `` goodwill and intangible assets `` of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impairment testing performed in calendar year 2014. investments . the company 's internal investment committee regularly reviews its fixed income and equity investment portfolio for any unrealized losses that would be deemed other-than-temporary and require the recognition of an impairment loss in income . if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value , the company evaluates , among other factors , general market conditions , the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost , and the company 's intent and ability to hold the investment . management also considers the type of security , related industry , sector performance , as well as published investment ratings and analyst reports to evaluate its portfolio . once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary , an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established . if market , industry , and or investee conditions deteriorate , the company may incur future impairments . self insurance . the company is self-insured for health and workers ' compensation benefits up to certain

","In 2014, North American automotive mirror unit shipments rose by 6% compared to the previous year, driven by a 12% increase in exterior auto-dimming mirrors. International shipments surged by 14%, largely due to greater adoption of both interior and exterior auto-dimming mirrors among European and Japanese automakers. Other net sales climbed 27% to $35.4 million, with dimmable aircraft window sales up 54% and fire protection sales increasing by 4%. The cost of goods sold (COGS) as a percentage of net sales decreased from 63.2% in 2013 to 60.8% in 2014, attributed to product mix improvements and purchasing cost reductions. Engineering, research, and development expenses rose by $7.7 million to 6% of net sales, while selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 13% to 4% of net sales, mainly due to amortization from the HomeLink acquisition. Total other income decreased, primarily from lower investment income and realized gains on equity investments. The effective tax rate fell to 30.5% from 32.0% in the prior year, influenced by research and development tax credits totaling $10.3 million. Net income increased by $65.7 million, or 29%, reflecting higher sales and gross profit. In 2013, net sales had already increased by 7%, with automotive net sales up 6% on a 10% rise in auto-dimming mirror shipments, totaling 26.2 million units."
120,"we have incurred significant losses since we commenced operations in 2002 and expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future . at december 31 , 2017 , we had an accumulated deficit of $ 2.15 billion . historically , we have generated losses principally from costs associated with research and development activities , acquiring , filing and expanding intellectual property rights and general administrative costs . as a result of planned expenditures for research and development activities relating to our research platform , our drug development programs , including clinical trial and manufacturing costs , the establishment of late stage clinical and commercial capabilities , including global operations , continued management and growth of our patent portfolio , collaborations and general corporate activities , we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future . we also anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future . therefore , period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods . we currently have programs focused on a number of therapeutic areas and , in december 2017 , submitted our first nda and maa for marketing approval for patisiran . however , our development efforts may not be successful and we may not be able to commence sales of patisiran or any other product . if we gain approval for and successfully launch patisiran in 2018 , we may begin to generate net revenues from product sales . a substantial portion of our total revenues in recent years has been derived from collaboration revenues from strategic alliances with sanofi genzyme and mdco . in addition to potential revenues from the commercial sale of patisiran and future product candidates , we expect our sources of potential funding for the next several years to be derived primarily from existing and new strategic alliances , which may include license and other fees , funded research and development , milestone payments and royalties on product sales by our licensors , and proceeds from the sale of equity or debt . 69 research and development since our inception , we have focused on drug discovery and development programs . research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses , as reflected by our broad pipeline of clinical development programs , which includes several programs in late-stage development and one product in registration in the united states and the eu . there is a risk that any drug discovery or development program may not produce revenue for a variety of reasons , including the possibility that we will not be able to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate . for example , in october 2016 , we announced the discontinuation of our revusiran clinical development program due to safety concerns and in september 2017 , we announced that we had temporarily suspended dosing in all ongoing fitusiran studies . moreover , there are uncertainties specific to any new field of drug discovery , including rnai . the success of any product candidate we develop is highly uncertain . due to the numerous risks associated with developing drugs , we can not reasonably estimate or know the nature , timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of , or the period , if any , in which material net cash inflows will commence from , any potential product candidate . any failure to complete any stage of the development of any potential products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations , financial position and liquidity . a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule , or at all , and the potential consequences of failing to do so , are set forth in part i , item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k under the heading â€œ risk factors . â€ strategic alliances a significant component of our business plan is to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and life sciences companies , academic institutions , research foundations and others , as appropriate , to gain access to funding , capabilities , technical resources and intellectual property to further our research , development and commercialization efforts and to generate revenues . we may also seek to form or advance new ventures and opportunities in areas outside our primary focus on rnai therapeutics . our collaboration strategy is to form alliances that create significant value for ourselves and our collaborators in the advancement of rnai therapeutics as a potential new class of innovative medicines . specifically , with respect to our genetic medicine pipeline , we formed a broad strategic alliance with sanofi genzyme in 2014 pursuant to which we retain development and commercial rights for our current and future genetic medicine products in the united states , canada and western europe , and sanofi genzyme will develop and commercialize our current and future genetic medicine products for which it elects to opt-in , in the rest of the world , subject to certain broader rights . in january 2018 , we and sanofi genzyme amended our 2014 sanofi genzyme collaboration to provide that we would develop and commercialize patisiran globally and sanofi genzyme would develop and commercialize fitusiran globally . with respect to our cardio-metabolic pipeline , we intend to seek future strategic alliances for these programs , under which we may retain certain product development and commercialization rights , or we may structure as global alliances , as we did in our collaboration with mdco to advance inclisiran . with respect to our hepatic infectious disease pipeline , in october 2017 , we announced an exclusive licensing agreement with vir biotechnology for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics for infectious diseases , including chronic hepatitis b virus infection . story_separator_special_tag in connection with the 2018 amendment , the exclusive ttr license and the at3 license terms , we and sanofi genzyme agreed to terminate the co-development and co-commercialization rights related to revusiran , aln-ttrsc02 and fitusiran under the original 2014 sanofi genzyme collaboration . no future rights will be granted to sanofi genzyme for co-development and co-commercialization under the 2014 sanofi genzyme collaboration , as amended . please read note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii , item 8 , â€œ financial statements and supplementary data , â€ of this annual report on form 10-k for our discussion of the terms of the exclusive ttr license and the at3 license terms . in connection with the 2014 sanofi genzyme collaboration , we sold to sanofi genzyme 8,766,338 shares of our common stock and sanofi genzyme paid us $ 700.0 million in aggregate cash consideration . based on the common stock price of $ 85.72 , the fair value of the shares issued was $ 751.5 million , which was $ 51.5 million in excess of the proceeds received from sanofi genzyme for the issuance of our common stock . this $ 51.5 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the performance period for the aln-ttr programs . sanofi genzyme will be required to make payments totaling up to $ 75.0 million per regional product , consisting of up to $ 55.0 million in development milestones and $ 20.0 million in commercial milestones . sanofi genzyme will also be required to pay tiered double-digit royalties up to twenty percent for each regional product based on annual net sales , if any , of such regional product by sanofi genzyme , its affiliates and sublicensees . in consideration for the rights granted to sanofi genzyme under the co-development/co-commercialize license terms , sanofi genzyme was required to make certain milestone payments for fitusiran , and , prior to the discontinuation of our revusiran clinical development program , was required to make certain milestone payments for revusiran . in december 2014 , we earned a development milestone payment of $ 25.0 million based upon the initiation of the first global phase 3 clinical trial for revusiran . finally , with respect to its one global product right , sanofi genzyme will be required to make payments totaling up to $ 200.0 million for such global product , including up to $ 100.0 million in development milestones and $ 100.0 million in commercial milestones . sanofi genzyme will also be required to pay tiered double-digit royalties up to twenty percent for such global product based on annual net sales , if any , of such global product by sanofi genzyme , its affiliates and sublicensees . 73 due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development , we may not receive any additional milestone payments or any royalty payments from sanofi genzyme under the 2014 sanofi genzyme collaboration , as amended , or the at3 license terms . we determined that the deliverables for the programs on which sanofi genzyme was collaborating with us upon initiation of the 2014 collaboration included the licenses to our patisiran and revusiran clinical programs , which licenses were delivered to sanofi genzyme upon the closing date of the transaction , and the associated development activities , joint steering committee participation and information exchange for these clinical programs . we also determined that , pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements , the license and associated undelivered development activities , joint steering committee participation and information exchange activities did not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the services to be provided by us . in addition , while sanofi genzyme has the ability to grant sublicenses , it can not sublicense all or substantially all of its rights under the 2014 sanofi genzyme collaboration . the uniqueness of our services and the limited sublicense rights are indicators that standalone value is not present in the arrangement . therefore the deliverables are not separable and , accordingly , the license and undelivered services were treated as a single unit of accounting . when multiple deliverables are accounted for as a single unit of accounting , we base our revenue recognition model on the final deliverable . under the 2014 sanofi genzyme collaboration , the last deliverables for patisiran and revusiran were expected to be completed within approximately six years from the closing date of the transaction and the last deliverables for fitusiran were expected to be completed within approximately five years from the date sanofi genzyme elected to opt into our fitusiran program under the regional license terms . our estimate regarding the performance period under the 2014 sanofi genzyme collaboration related to the license to our patisiran and revusiran clinical programs was adjusted in october 2016 due to our decision to discontinue development of revusiran . as a result , with respect to these programs , we currently expect the last deliverables to be completed within approximately five years from the closing date of the transaction as compared to an initial expectation of approximately six years . our estimate regarding the performance period under the 2014 sanofi genzyme collaboration related to the license to our fitusiran program was adjusted in september 2017 due to our temporary suspension of dosing in all ongoing fitusiran studies . as a result , with respect to the fitusiran program , we currently expect the last deliverables to be completed within approximately six years from the date sanofi genzyme elected to opt into the program under the regional license terms as compared to an initial expectation of approximately five years . beginning in september 2017 , we are prospectively recognizing the remaining deferred revenue as of august 31 , 2017 related to the license to our fitusiran program over this adjusted performance period . we determined that the total cash received from
","Since commencing operations in 2002, the company has faced substantial financial losses, accumulating a deficit of $2.15 billion as of December 31, 2017. The primary sources of these losses stem from research and development (R&D) expenses, intellectual property costs, and administrative expenses. The company anticipates continued operating losses due to ongoing investments in R&D, clinical trials, and the establishment of commercial capabilities. Despite submitting its first New Drug Application (NDA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for patisiran in December 2017, the success of its drug development efforts remains uncertain. Collaboration revenues from strategic alliances, particularly with Sanofi Genzyme and MDCO, have been significant, and future funding is expected to derive from new and existing partnerships, milestone payments, and royalties. The company has a broad pipeline of clinical programs, including several in late-stage development, but acknowledges the high risks associated with drug development, including the potential for failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy. In 2014, the company entered a collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme, which included the sale of 8,766,338 shares for $700 million, with additional milestone payments and royalties based on product sales. However, uncertainties in pharmaceutical development may hinder the realization of these potential revenues. The company has adjusted its expectations for the completion of deliverables under the Sanofi collaboration due to the discontinuation of the revusiran program and the temporary suspension of fitusiran studies, now estimating completion within approximately five to six years from the transaction's closing date."

lendingtree , a controlling interest in evite , and certain other assets and liabilities as the `` company `` , `` us `` , `` we `` and `` our . `` although holdco was reported as a combined company until the date of the holdco split-off , the accompanying financial statements and the following discussion present all periods as consolidated by the company . customer billing systems on august 4 , 2018 , gci holdings transferred its customer billing systems for business and consumer voice , data , video , and wireless services to a new third-party billing system to better meet its needs . the new billing system has many benefits including a single invoice for customers , meaningful efficiencies for processing transactions , and the ability to accelerate the introduction of new products and promotions . update on economic conditions gci holdings offers wireless and wireline telecommunication services , data services , video services , and managed services to customers primarily throughout alaska . because of this geographic concentration , growth of gci holdings ' business and operations depends upon economic conditions in alaska . the economy of alaska is dependent upon the oil industry , state government spending , united states military spending , investment earnings and tourism . prolonged periods of low oil prices adversely impacts the alaska economy , which in turn can have an adverse impact on the demand for gci holdings ' products and services and on its results of operations and financial condition . low oil prices have put significant pressure on the alaska state government budget since the majority of its revenue comes from the oil industry . while the alaska state government has significant reserves that gci holdings believes will help fund the state government for the next couple of years , major structural budgetary reforms will need to be implemented in order to offset the impact of low oil prices . the alaska economy is in a recession that started in late 2015. while it is difficult for gci holdings to predict the future impact of the continuing recession on its business , these conditions have had an adverse impact on its business and could continue to adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of its products and services and cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of its products and services . additionally , gci holdings ' customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit , which could affect their ability to make timely payments to gci holdings . if that were to occur , gci holdings could be required to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts , and the number of days outstanding for its accounts receivable could increase . if the recession continues , it could continue to negatively affect gci holdings ' business including its financial position , results of operations , or liquidity , as well as its ability to service debt and pay other obligations . rural health care ( â€œ rhc â€ ) program gci holdings receives support from various universal service fund ( `` usf `` ) programs including the rhc program . the usf programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the federal communications commission ( `` fcc `` ) or legislative actions . the following paragraphs describe certain separate matters related to the rhc program that impact or could impact the revenue earned by the company . in november 2017 , the universal service administrative company ( `` usac `` ) requested further information in support of the rural rates charged to a number of gci holdings ' rhc customers in connection with the funding requests for the year that runs july 1 , 2017 through june 30 , 2018. on october 10 , 2018 , gci holdings received a letter from the fcc 's wireline competition bureau ( â€œ bureau â€ ) notifying it of the bureau 's decision to reduce the rural rates charged to rhc customers for the funding year that ended on june 30 , 2018 by approximately 26 % resulting in a reduction of total support payments of $ 27.8 million . the fcc also informed gci holdings that the same cost methodology used for the funding year that ended on june 30 , 2018 would be applied to rates charged to rhc customers in subsequent funding years . in response to the letter from the bureau , gci holdings filed an application for review of the bureau 's decision with the fcc . in the third quarter of 2018 , gci holdings recorded a $ 19.1 million reduction in its receivables balance as part of its acquisition accounting and recorded a reduction in revenue in the current period for the funding year that ended on june 30 , 2018 of approximately $ 8.6 million . gci holdings expects to reduce future rhc program revenue by a similar rate as to the funding year that ended on june 30 , 2018 , which based on a current run rate would approximate $ 7 million per quarter until it can reach a final resolution with the fcc regarding the funding amounts . ii-2 on march 15 , 2018 , usac announced that the funding requests for the year that runs july 1 , 2017 through june 30 , 2018 exceeded the funding available for the rhc program . story_separator_special_tag we may use quoted market prices , prices for similar assets , present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates . we may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques . due to the high degree of judgment involved in our estimation techniques , any value ultimately derived from our intangible or long-lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value . we utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property and equipment in connection with business combinations . the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility , then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and technological obsolescence as of the appraisal date . the cost approach relies on management 's assumptions regarding current ii-8 material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property and equipment . the accounting guidance permits entities to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired . if the qualitative assessment supports that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the company 's indefinite-lived intangible assets , other than goodwill , exceeds its fair value , then a quantitative assessment is performed . at december 31 , 2018 , the company determined that it was necessary to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of its cable certificates and wireless licenses . an impairment was recorded in the amount of $ 65 million ( see note 8 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements ) . we utilize an income approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our customer relationships , cable certificates , and wireless licenses in connection with business combinations . the income approach quantifies the expected earnings of our customer relationships , cable certificates , and wireless licenses by isolating the after tax cash flows attributable to the respective asset and then discounting the cash flows to their present value . the income approach relies on management 's assumptions such as projected revenue , market penetration , expenses , capital expenditures , customer trends , and a discount rate applied to the estimated after tax cash flows . we perform our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill in the fourth quarter each year . the company utilizes a qualitative assessment for determining whether the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is necessary . the accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test . in evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis , the company reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units . the company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions , industry specific conditions , market changes , increased competition , increased costs in doing business , management challenges , legal environments and how these factors might impact company specific performance in future periods . as part of the analysis , the company also considers fair value determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior year for other purposes . at december 31 , 2018 , the company determined that it was necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for the gci holdings reporting unit . an impairment was recorded in the amount of $ 147 million ( see note 8 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements ) . due to this impairment , the carrying value of the gci holdings reporting unit approximates fair value as of december 31 , 2018. the fair value of goodwill is determined using an income approach . the company 's income approach model used for its goodwill valuation is consistent with that used for the cable certificates except that cash flows from the entire business enterprise are used for the goodwill valuation . income taxes . we are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate . this process requires our management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions that we enter into . based on these judgments we may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability of future tax benefits . actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law , significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate , our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year 's liability by taxing authorities . these changes could have a significant impact on our financial position . results of operations - gci holdings , llc gci holdings provides a full range of

","GCI Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of GCI, LLC, provides telecommunications services in Alaska, including wireless, wireline, data, video, and managed services. This economic downturn has negatively impacted customer demand and affordability for GCI's services. In 2018, GCI Holdings transitioned to a new customer billing system to enhance efficiency. The company also receives support from the Universal Service Fund (USF), specifically the Rural Health Care (RHC) program, but faced a 26% reduction in rural rates, resulting in a $27.8 million decrease in support payments. GCI Holdings recorded a $19.1 million reduction in receivables and an $8.6 million revenue decrease for the funding year ending June 30, 2018. Future RHC program revenue is expected to decline by approximately $7 million per quarter until a resolution with the FCC is reached. Additionally, GCI Holdings recorded impairments of $65 million for cable certificates and wireless licenses, and $147 million for goodwill as of December 31, 2018, reflecting the company's financial struggles amid the recession. The companyâ€™s financial position is further complicated by the need for tax estimates and potential changes in tax laws, which could significantly impact its operations."
122,"accordingly , during fiscal 2017 , we recorded $ 18.1 million of impairment charges , which included the write down of $ 13.3 million of property , plant and equipment and $ 4.8 million of intangible assets . refer to note 5 , goodwill and intangible assets , and note 12 , property , plant and equipment , to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information . divestiture on april 27 , 2017 , we sold our sebra sealers product line to machine solutions inc. because it was no longer aligned with our long-term strategic objectives . in connection with this transaction , we received net proceeds of $ 9 million . these proceeds 22 are subject to a post-closing adjustment based on final asset values as determined during the 90 day transition period . the preliminary pre-tax gain expected to be recorded as a result of this transaction is $ 8 million . the sebra portfolio includes a suite of products which primarily include radio frequency sealers that are used to seal tubing as part of the collection of whole blood and blood components , particularly plasma . the sebra product line generated approximately $ 6 million of revenue in our plasma business unit in fiscal 2017. product recall in june 2016 , we issued a voluntary recall of certain whole blood collection kits sold to our blood center customers in the u.s. the recall resulted from some collection sets ' filters failing to adequately remove leukocytes from collected blood . as a result of the recall , our blood center customers may have conducted further tests to confirm the blood was adequately leukoreduced , sold the blood labeled as non-leukoreduced at a lower price or discarded the blood collected using the defective sets . as a result of the recall , we have recorded total charges of $ 7.1 million during fiscal 2017 , which consists of $ 3.7 million of charges associated with customer returns and inventory reserves and $ 3.4 million of charges associated with customer claims , as discussed below . we may record incremental charges in future periods . the $ 3.7 million of charges associated with customer returns consisted of $ 2.5 million of sales returns , $ 1.1 million of net inventory reserves for the affected sets on-hand that had not yet been shipped to customers and $ 0.1 million of freight expenses . the $ 3.4 million of charges associated with customer claims are based on claims seeking reimbursement for $ 14.2 million in losses sustained as a result of the recall . while the customers making these claims purchased substantially all the affected units , incremental charges may be recorded in future periods as additional data supporting the claims becomes available . we have an enforceable insurance policy in place which we believe provides coverage for a portion of the claims received to date . as of april 1 , 2017 , we had an insurance receivable of $ 2.9 million . we will assess the potential for additional insurance recoveries as we receive more information about customer claims in future reporting periods . declines in u.s. blood center collections the demand for whole blood disposable products in the u.s. continued to decrease in fiscal 2017 and 2016 due to a sustained decline in transfusion rates and actions taken by hospitals to improve blood management techniques and protocols . in response to this trend , u.s. blood center collection groups selected single source vendors for their whole blood collection products and became primarily focused on obtaining the lowest average selling prices . while we began to see a moderation in the rate of market decline during fiscal 2017 , we expect to see continued declines in transfusion rates and the market to remain price-focused and highly competitive for the foreseeable future . apheresis red cell collection arrangements during fiscal 2016 , the american red cross and two group purchasing organizations representing other u.s. blood collectors ( `` blood center gpos `` ) requested updated contracts for sole source supply on apheresis red cell collections . the resulting pricing in our american red cross contract and the recommendations by both blood center gpos that their members use our competitor 's technology continue to negatively affect red cell revenues and gross margins . the american red cross contract resulted in our gaining 100 % share of their apheresis red cell collection business and higher sales volumes , but at lower prices . the impact of the price concessions began in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 , while the achievement of 100 % share of the american red cross ' business occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. the negative impact on fiscal 2017 operating income as a result of the american red cross contract and market share losses among members of the blood center gpos was an additional $ 8 million as compared to fiscal 2016. while we expect this negative impact to continue in the first half of fiscal 2018 , we anticipate stabilization in the second half of fiscal 2018 after annualization of the final price concessions . red cell disposable revenues in the u.s. totaled $ 26.0 million and $ 34.8 million during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , respectively . declines in platelet collections while we market our platelet products globally , the dynamics of each market are significantly different . despite modest increases in the demand for platelets in europe and japan , improved collection efficiencies that increase the yield of platelets per collection and more efficient use of collected platelets have resulted in flat markets for platelet usage and related disposables in these regions . within these flat markets , the use of `` double dose `` collection methods and other alternative collection procedures in europe and japan has increased . story_separator_special_tag 28 red cell revenue decreased 8.1 % during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 . without the effects of foreign exchange , red cell revenue decreased 7.0 % during fiscal 2016 . the decrease was driven by price reductions in our principal u.s. red cell market . during fiscal 2016 , u.s. blood collection groups pursued contractual arrangements for apheresis red cell collections with the objective of standardizing their collection technology and securing price reductions . these arrangements , most notably the contract with the american red cross as discussed above , began to negatively affect red cell revenues and gross margins during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 . whole blood revenue decreased 9.9 % during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 . without the effect of foreign exchange , whole blood revenue decreased 8.9 % during fiscal 2017 . while whole blood revenue decreased as compared to the prior year periods , we began to see a moderation in the rate of decline of this market during fiscal 2017. we expect to see continued declines in transfusion rates and the market to remain price-focused and highly competitive for the foreseeable future . whole blood revenue decreased 10.7 % during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 . without the effect of

","In fiscal 2017, the company recorded $18.1 million in impairment charges, comprising $13.3 million for property, plant, and equipment and $4.8 million for intangible assets. On April 27, 2017, the company divested its Sebra sealers product line to Machine Solutions Inc. for net proceeds of $9 million, with a preliminary pre-tax gain of $8 million expected. The Sebra product line generated approximately $6 million in revenue in fiscal 2017. Additionally, a voluntary recall of whole blood collection kits in June 2016 led to $7.1 million in charges during fiscal 2017, including $3.7 million for customer returns and inventory reserves and $3.4 million for customer claims. The company anticipates further charges as claims evolve. U.S. blood center collections continued to decline, with red cell disposable revenues dropping from $34.8 million in fiscal 2016 to $26.0 million in fiscal 2017, reflecting a decrease. Whole blood revenue also fell by 9.9% year-over-year. The American Red Cross contract resulted in a $8 million negative impact on operating income in fiscal 2017. Software, equipment, and other revenues decreased by 10.6% in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the expiration of a U.S. government software contract. Cell salvage revenues from orthopat decreased by 18.3%, while cell saver revenue declined by 6.3%. However, hemostasis management revenue increased,driven by growth in TEG disposables, particularly in the U.S. and China. Overall, the company faced significant challenges in revenue generation across various segments, with a continued focus on price competition and market dynamics."
123,"in addition to the leveling of housing starts , a persistent price gap exists between newly built homes and existing homes with sales of existing homes showing improvements while sales of new homes continued to lag in the fourth quarter of 2014. furthermore , hud has noted that the listed inventories of new and of existing homes at the end of the fourth quarter 2014 would support 5.4 months and 4.4 months , respectively , of sales at the current sales pace , while historical average supply of homes on the market is 6.0 months . in addition to fewer housing starts , a persistent price gap exists between newly built homes and existing homes . while new homes are almost always are more expensive , on average , than their older comparables , that gap has widened since the last recession . the mortgage bank association estimates that total one-to-four family mortgage loan originations ( including both purchase and refinance transactions ) will increase from $ 1.1 trillion in 2014 to $ 1.2 trillion in 2015 . 54 cyclical trends are prompting a significant realignment within the mortgage sector . these trends and their effects include : continuing sales of residential mortgage assets by banks and other mortgage lenders due to elevated operating costs resulting from new regulatory requirements , delinquencies and impairments ; â€‹ the continuing decline in home ownership that , conversely , has increased the demand for single-family and multi-family residential rental properties and associated rents ; â€‹ the dislocations in the residential mortgage loan origination market and the limited availability of financing for non-gse mortgages since 2008 , which have made qualifying for a mortgage loan more difficult . these factors , combined with shifting demographic trends and the need for families pushed out of their homes through foreclosure or the inability to continue to pay their mortgage loans , are driving increased demand for loan modifications , non-gse mortgage financing and single-family rental properties ; â€‹ the changing regulatory landscape , leading to the reduction of the government 's role in , and the return of private capital , including non-bank participants , to the housing finance market ; some of the changes have begun to be implemented , as evidenced by the tightening of conforming loan limits and increases in guarantee fees ; and â€‹ unemployment remaining relatively high , under-employment continuing to be a concern and real wages continuing to be stagnant , which means that the ability of borrowers to continue to pay their existing mortgage loans will likely remain under pressure . â€‹ the current market landscape is also generating new opportunities in residential mortgage-related whole loan strategies . the origination of subprime and alternative residential mortgage loans has dramatically declined since 2008 and the new qm and atr rule requirements will also put pressure on new originations . additionally , many banks and other mortgage lenders have increased their credit standards and down payment requirements for originating new loans . the combination of these factors has also resulted in a significant number of families that can not qualify to obtain new residential mortgage loans . we believe new u.s. federal regulations addressing â€œ qualified mortgages â€ based , among other factors on employment status , debt-to-income level , impaired credit history or lack of savings , will continue to limit mortgage loan availability from traditional mortgage lenders . in addition , we believe that many homeowners displaced by foreclosure or who either can not afford to own or can not be approved for a mortgage will prefer to live in single-family rental properties with similar characteristics and amenities to owned homes as well as smaller multi-family residential properties . in certain demographic areas , new households are being formed at a rate that exceeds the new homes being added to the market , which we believe favors future demand for non-federally guaranteed mortgage financing for single-family and smaller multi-family rental properties . for all these reasons , we believe that demand for single-family and smaller multi-family rental properties will increase in the near term and remain at heightened levels in the foreseeable future . we expect the availability of pools of re-performing and non-performing loans , properties in foreclosure and reo to increase and remain elevated over the next several years . the single family mortgage delinquency rate at december 31 , 2014 is 6.71 % , according to the federal reserve board . overall housing values have rebounded since 2012 ; however , corelogic Â® , a leading global property information , analytics and data-enabled services provider , has reported that approximately 5.4 million homes , or 10.8 % of all residential properties with a mortgage , were in a negative position as of the end of the fourth quarter 2014. negative equity , often referred to as â€œ underwater â€ or â€œ upside down , â€ means that borrowers owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth . negative equity can occur because of a decline in value , an increase in mortgage debt or a combination of both . for the homes in negative equity status , the national aggregate value of negative equity was $ 349 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014 , up $ 7 billion from approximately $ 342 billion at the end of the third quarter 2014. in addition , corelogic Â® reports that of the 49.9 million residential properties with equity , approximately 10 million have less than 20 % equity . borrowers with less than 20 % equity , referred to as â€œ under-equitied , â€ may have a more difficult time refinancing their existing home or obtaining new financing to sell and buy another home due to 55 underwriting constraints . story_separator_special_tag we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy , the value of these agreements to decrease . market conditions . due to the dramatic repricing of real estate assets during the most recent financial crisis and the continuing uncertainty in the direction and continuing strength of the real estate markets , we believe a void in the debt and equity capital available for investing in real estate has been created as many financial institutions , insurance companies , finance companies and fund managers face insolvency or have determined to reduce or discontinue investment in debt or equity related to real estate . we believe the dislocations in the residential real estate market have resulted or will result in an â€œ over-correction â€ in the repricing of real estate assets , creating a potential opportunity for us to capitalize on these market dislocations and capital void . we believe that in spite of the continuing uncertain market environment for mortgage-related assets , current market conditions offer potentially attractive investment opportunities for us , even in the face of a riskier and more volatile market environment , as the depressed trading prices of our target assets have caused a corresponding increase in available yields . we expect that market conditions will continue to impact our operating results and will cause us to adjust our investment and financing strategies over time as new opportunities emerge and risk profiles of our business change . critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our critical accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . actual results could differ from those estimates . we consider significant estimates to include expected cash flows from mortgage loans and fair value measurements . we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our consolidated financial statements are and will be based were or will be reasonable at the time made based upon information available to us at that time . we have identified our most critical accounting policies to be the following : mortgage loans , net . purchased mortgage loans are initially recorded at the purchase price at the time of acquisition and are considered asset acquisitions . as part of the determination of the purchase price for mortgage loans , we use a discounted cash flow valuation model to model expected cash flows , and which considers alternate loan resolution probabilities , including liquidation or conversion to real estate owned . observable inputs to the model include current interest rates , loan amounts , status of payments and property types . unobservable inputs to the model include discount rates and loan resolution timelines . 59 under asc 310-30 , acquired loans may be aggregated and accounted for as a pool of loans if the loans being aggregated have some degree of credit quality deterioration since origination and have common risk characteristics . a pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows . the re-performing mortgage loans were determined to have common risk characteristics and have been accounted for as a single loan pool . similarly , non-performing mortgage loans were determined to have common risk characteristics and have been accounted for as a single non-performing pool . under asc 310-30 , the company estimates cash flows expected to be collected , adjusted for expected prepayments and defaults expected to be incurred over the life of the loan pool . the company determines the excess of the loan pool 's contractually required principal and interest payments over the expected cash flows as an amount that should not be accreted , the non-accretable yield . the difference between expected cash flows and the purchase price ( at acquisition ) or the present value of the expected cash flows is referred to as the accretable yield , which represents the amount that is expected to be recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan pool . for the period ended december 31 , 2014 , the company recognized no provision for loan loss and no adjustments to the amount of the accretable yield . for the period ended december 31 , 2014 , the company accreted $ 6.9 million into interest income with respect to its loan portfolio . as of december 31 , 2014 , these loans had a upb of $ 304.5 million and a carrying value of $ 211.2 million . generally , we acquire loans at a discount associated with some degree of credit impairment . we elect to aggregate certain pools of loans with common risk characteristics and accrue interest income thereon at a composite interest rate , based on expectations of cash flows to be collected for the pool . expectations of pool cash flow are reviewed quarterly . adjustments to a pool 's prospective composite interest rate or an allowance for impairment are made to the extent revised expectations differ from original estimates . for loans that do not qualify for pool aggregation treatment , including performing loans that are not purchased at discounts resulting from credit-related issues , interest is recognized using the simple-interest method on daily balances of the principal amount outstanding , adjusted for the amortization or accretion of the loan premium or discount over the contractual life of the loan . accrual of interest on individual loans is discontinued when management believes that , after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts , the borrower 's financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful . our policy is to stop accruing interest when a loan 's delinquency exceeds 90 days . all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on non-accrual status or subsequently charged-off are reversed against interest income .
","As of the end of Q4 2014, housing starts have leveled off, with a notable price gap between newly built homes and existing homes, where existing home sales improved while new home sales lagged. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reported that inventories of new and existing homes could support 5.4 months and 4.4 months of sales, respectively, compared to a historical average of 6.0 months. The Mortgage Bankers Association projected total mortgage loan originations to rise from $1.1 trillion in 2014 to $1.2 trillion in 2015. Factors influencing the mortgage sector include ongoing sales of residential mortgage assets, a decline in homeownership, and increased demand for rental properties. The single-family mortgage delinquency rate stood at 6.71%, with approximately 5.4 million homes (10.8% of mortgaged properties) in negative equity, totaling a national aggregate value of $349 billion. CoreLogic reported that about 10 million of the 49.9 million residential properties with equity had less than 20% equity, complicating refinancing efforts. The market is witnessing a shift towards non-federally guaranteed mortgage financing for single-family and smaller multi-family rental properties, driven by demographic changes and regulatory adjustments. The company recognized no provision for loan loss for the period ended December 31, 2014, while accruing $6.9 million in interest income from a loan portfolio with an unpaid principal balance of $304.5 million and a carrying value of $211.2 million. Overall, the market is expected to see increased demand for rental properties and a rise in the availability of re-performing and non-performing loans in the coming years."
124,"since the share distribution on september 30 , 2015 through march 31 , 2020 , our exited investments resulted in a weighted average internal rate of return to the company of approximately 16.4 % ( based on original cash invested of approximately $ 227.0 million ) . internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero . internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments . investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and , thus , a loss may have been realized . approximately 87.4 % of these exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized internal rate of return to the company of 10 % or greater . because we are internally managed , we do not pay any external investment advisory fees , but instead directly incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals . we believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly traded and privately held investment firms which are externally managed , and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio . for the years ended march 31 , 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , the ratio of our annualized fourth quarter operating expenses , excluding interest expense , as a percentage of our quarterly average total assets was 2.37 % , 2.81 % and 3.36 % , respectively . recent covid-19 developments the outbreak of covid-19 has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets . the global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and many countries , including the united states , have reacted by instituting quarantines , imposed restricting travel , and temporarily closing many corporate offices , retail stores , restaurants , fitness clubs and manufacturing facilities and factories in affected jurisdictions . such actions are creating disruption in global supply chains and adversely impacting a number of industries . the outbreak could have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown . we are closely monitoring the impact of the outbreak of covid-19 on all aspects of our business , including how it will impact our portfolio companies , employees , due diligence and underwriting processes , and financial markets . given the fluidity of the situation , we can not estimate the long-term impact of covid-19 on our business , future results of operations , financial position or cash flows at this time . further , the operational and financial performance of the portfolio companies in which we make investments may be significantly impacted by covid-19 , which may in turn impact the valuation of our investments . we believe our portfolio companies have taken immediate actions to effectively and efficiently respond to the challenges posed by covid-19 and related orders imposed by state and local governments , including developing liquidity plans supported by internal cash reserves , shareholder support , and , as appropriate , accessing their ability to participate in the recently enacted government paycheck protection program . the extent to which our operations may be impacted by the covid-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments , which are highly uncertain and can not be accurately predicted , including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its 47 impact . furthermore , the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown . we have evaluated subsequent events from march 31 , 2020 through the filing date of this annual report on form 10-k ,

fiscal year ended march 31 , 2020 , the analysis contained herein may not fully account for impacts relating to the covid-19 pandemic . in that regard , for example , as of march 31 , 2020 , the company valued its portfolio investments in conformity with u.s. gaap based on the facts and circumstances known by the company at that time , or reasonably expected to be known at that time . due to the overall volatility that the covid-19 pandemic has caused during the months that followed our march 31 , 2020 valuation , any valuations conducted now or in the future in conformity with u.s. gaap could result in a lower fair value of our portfolio . the impact to our results going forward may depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of covid-19 and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain the covid-19 or treat its impact , all of which are beyond our control . accordingly , the company can not predict the extent to which its financial condition and results of operations will be affected at this time . critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of our

net realized gain ( loss ) on investments before income tax â€ and â€œ net change in unrealized appreciation on investments , net of tax â€ are directly related in that when an appreciated portfolio security is sold to realize a gain , a corresponding decrease in net unrealized appreciation occurs by transferring the gain associated with the transaction from being â€œ unrealized â€ to being â€œ

126,"we intend to use substantially all of the proceeds from our initial offering to acquire and operate a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate assets that are expected to provide consistent current income and may also provide capital appreciation resulting from our expectation that in certain circumstances we will be able to acquire properties at a discount to replacement cost or otherwise less than the anticipated market value or to expend capital to reposition or redevelop a property so as to increase its value over the amount of cash we paid to acquire and rehabilitate the property . in particular , we plan to diversify our portfolio by property type , geographic region , investment size and investment risk with the goal of acquiring a portfolio of income producing real estate properties and real estate related assets that provide attractive returns for our stockholders . we intend to primarily acquire , or participate in joint ventures owning , a wide variety of commercial properties , including office , industrial , retail , hospitality , medical office , single-tenant , multifamily , student housing and other real properties , including raw land . these properties are initially expected to be existing , income-producing properties ; additionally , we may invest in newly constructed properties or properties under development or construction . in addition , given the then existing economic conditions and subject to applicable reit requirements , our investment strategy may also include investments in real estate-related assets such as mortgage , mezzanine , bridge and other loans and debt and equity securities issued by other real estate companies ; however , we intend to limit these types of investments so that neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries will meet the definition of an `` investment company `` under the investment company act . we expect to make our investments in real estate assets located in the united states . our investment strategy is designed to provide our stockholders with a diversified portfolio of real estate assets . as of december 31 , 2013 , we have made three equity investments through our operating partnership . the first was in wynthrope forest , a 270-unit , 23-building multifamily community in a suburb of atlanta , georgia . the second was in tcg cincinnati dre lp , a three-building industrial portfolio totaling approximately 576,751 square feet in the greater cincinnati area . the most recent investment is in 5400 fulton industrial boulevard , a warehouse facility , containing

permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our qualification is denied . such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and cash available for distribution . 18 market outlook â€” real estate and real estate finance markets the following discussion is based on management 's beliefs , observations and expectations with respect to the real estate and real estate finance markets . after three years of momentum building throughout global capital markets , stemming from the financial crisis introduced during the 2008-2009 time period , global capital markets have experienced relatively decreased volatility due to fewer concerns about credit risk and increased reliance in the confidence of functioning global financial markets . economies throughout the world have experienced increased employment and consumer confidence due to an upturn in economic activity . despite certain recent positive economic indicators such as an improved stock market performance , an improved unemployment rate and improved access to capital for most companies , the strength of aforementioned economic conditions have been muted in certain sectors of the economy and overall growth of the economy continues to lag behind that of other post-recession economic rebounds . previous global government interventions in banking systems , and the persistence of a highly expansionary monetary policy by the u.s. treasury , has introduced additional complexity and uncertainty to the markets in the past few years . that being said , there has been a demonstrable increase in commercial real estate transaction activity and institutional commercial lending velocity since 2010. commercial property fundamentals have strengthened in all asset types , and lenders still maintain disciplined underwriting standards . fundamentals in the real estate market are improving due to growth in housing markets , construction , industrial production and improved consumer sentiment . continued improvement in the economy , combined with institutional investors increasingly allocating capital towards real assets , will likely result in additional measured growth throughout 2014/2015 . story_separator_special_tag its investments in joint ventures on a quarterly basis . story_separator_special_tag

and $ 1,065,000 were recognized as expenses of the company during the years ended december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively . the company continues to maintain arrangements with certain of its vendors to limit future expenses related to certain professional services . also , the company entered into agreements during the year ended december 31 , 2013 with its independent directors who agreed to receive all compensation through december 31 , 2013 and amounts accrued as of december 31 , 2012 in the form of stock . the company will continue this agreement into 2014. if the company is unable to generate sufficient liquidity to meet its needs and in a timely manner , the company may be required to further reduce operating expenses and limit their operations . if the company is unable to raise additional equity , it would result in the inability to acquire real estate assets or participate in joint ventures . results o f operations for the year ended december 31 , 2013 , we had a net loss of $ 3,472,224 , due primarily to legal , professional , filing and printing costs incurred in connection with the commencement of our operations . for the year ended december 31 , 2012

december 31 , 2013 and 2012 totaled $ 654,855 and $ 605,402 , respectively . these expenses consisted primarily of the allocation of salary earned by employees of the company 's affiliates for work

incurred by us in connection with our formation , including , but not limited to , legal fees and other costs to incorporate . organization costs are expensed as incurred and offering costs , which include selling commissions and dealer manager fees , are charged as incurred as a reduction to stockholders ' equity . pursuant to our advisory agreement and our dealer manager agreement , we are

primary offering and at the termination of the offering under our dividend reinvestment plan , our advisor has agreed to reimburse us to the extent that selling commissions , dealer manager fees and other organization and offering expenses incurred by us exceed 15 % of the gross offering proceeds of the respective offering . in addition , at the end of the primary offering and again at the end of the offering under our dividend reinvestment plan , our advisor has agreed to reimburse us to the extent that organization and offering expenses , excluding underwriting compensation ( which includes selling commissions , dealer manager fees and any other items viewed as underwriting compensation by the financial industry regulatory authority ) , exceed 2 % of the gross proceeds we raised in the respective offering . we reimburse our dealer manager for underwriting compensation as discussed in the prospectus for our ongoing initial offering . we also pay directly or reimburse our dealer manager for bona fide invoiced due diligence expenses of broker dealers . however , no reimbursements made by us to our advisor or our dealer manager may cause total organization and offering expenses incurred by us ( including selling commissions , dealer manager fees and all other items of organization and offering expenses ) to exceed 15 % of the aggregate gross proceeds from our primary offering and the offering under our distribution reinvestment plan at the date of reimbursement . through december 31 , 2013 , we had sold 1,050,050 shares in the initial offering for gross offering proceeds of $ 10.446 million and incurred selling commissions and dealer manager fees of $ 296,424 and other organizational and offering costs of $ 1,084,816. critical accounting policies we believe our most critical accounting policies are the regular evaluation of whether the value of a real estate asset has been impaired and accounting for joint ventures . each of these items involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature . we rely on our experience , we collect historical data and current market data , and we analyze these assumptions in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates . under different conditions or assumptions , materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below . in addition , application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and , as a result , actual results could materially differ from these estimates . 21 use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that

impact the total amount due , but instead , spread the $ 2.6 million into seven quarterly payments to be paid through september 30 , 2021. the amended license agreement required that in the event rezolute completed a qualified financing at any time between march 31 , 2020 and the date of the final payment , rezolute would pay all amounts outstanding within fifteen days following the closing of the qualified financing . in the first quarter of 2020 , we received the scheduled $ 0.4 million future cash payment from rezolute . we evaluated rezolute 's cash position as of march 31 , 2020 , including the estimated impact of the covid-19 pandemic , and determined payments scheduled beyond september 30 , 2020 were unlikely to be collected unless rezolute was able to obtain additional funding , which had not occurred as of march 31 , 2020. therefore , for the three months ended march 31 , 2020 , we recorded $ 1.4 million in bad debt expense related to the future cash payments . we received the scheduled $ 0.4 million and $ 0.4 million future cash payments from rezolute in the second and third quarters of 2020 , respectively . on october 9 , 2020 , rezolute completed a private placement of its equity securities with gross proceeds of $ 41.0 million , which was considered a qualified financing event under the third amendment . the qualified financing resulted in acceleration of the remaining receivables of $ 1.4 million due from rezolute , and we received the entire amount in october 2020. zydus in march 2020 , we entered into a license agreement ( the â€œ zydus agreement â€ ) with cadila healthcare limited ( â€œ zydus â€ ) under which we granted zydus an exclusive royalty-bearing license to our anti-interleukin-2 ( â€œ il-2 â€ ) monoclonal antibodies , including mab19 , for zydus to develop and commercialize drug candidates in india , brazil , mexico and certain other emerging markets . we retain rights in all other territories , subject to a zydus right of first negotiation . under the terms of the zydus agreement , zydus is responsible for the development and commercialization of il-2 based immuno-oncology drug candidates . xoma is entitled to receive up to $ 0.5 million in development and regulatory milestone payments , up to $ 23.5 million in commercial milestone payments , and mid single-digit to low teens royalties from zydus . we are also eligible to share out-licensing revenue received by zydus should zydus ( sub ) license to third parties , which share is tiered based on clinical trial stage and ranges from a low to mid double-digit percentage rate . â€‹ covid-19 the covid-19 pandemic continues to pose risks to our business as clinical trials industry-wide have slowed . our business is dependent on the continued development and commercialization efforts of our licensees and our royalty agreement counterparties and their licensees . we have been monitoring and continue to monitor our portfolio programs for potential delays in underlying research programs and elections of our partners to continue or cease development . delays in clinical trials and underlying research programs may lead to delayed revenue from milestones from our licensees and royalty agreement counterparties or , if certain research programs are discontinued , we may recognize impairment charges for our royalty receivables . covid-19 , the related variants , and the timing of vaccine distribution may impact our underlying programs in a variety of ways which are unknown in length and scope at this time . 48 â€‹ critical accounting estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures , which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states . the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates , assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes . on an ongoing basis , we evaluate our estimates , assumptions and judgments described below that have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements , including those related to legal contingencies , revenue recognized under units-of-revenue method and stock-based compensation . we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements , we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates , assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . story_separator_special_tag because it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved , such contingencies , aggregating up to $ 7.6 million ( assuming one product per contract meets all milestones ) have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 , 2020. we are unable to 55 determine precisely when and if our payment obligations under the agreements will become due as these obligations are based on milestone events , the achievement of which is subject to a significant number of risks and uncertainties . lease agreements in december 2019 , we terminated two of our operating leases in berkeley , california and were fully released from any further payment obligations . we continue to lease one administrative facility in emeryville , california under an operating lease expiring in february 2023. the lease requires us to pay taxes , insurance , maintenance and minimum lease payments . recent accounting pronouncements in june 2016 , the financial accounting standards board ( â€œ fasb â€ ) issued accounting standards update ( â€œ asu â€ ) 2016-13 , financial instruments-credit losses ( topic 326 ) : measurement of credit losses on financial instruments . asu 2016-13 replaced the incurred loss impairment methodology under current gaap with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates . asu 2016-13 requires use of a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables , loans , and other financial instruments . adoption of the standard requires using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align existing credit loss methodology with the new standard . subsequent to issuing asu 2016-13 , the fasb issued asu 2018-19 , codification improvements to topic 326 , financial instruments â€“ credit losses , or asu 2018-19 , for the purpose of clarifying certain aspects of asu 2016-13. in may 2019 , the fasb issued asu 2019-05 , financial instruments â€“ credit losses ( topic 326 ) : targeted transition relief , or asu 2019-05 , to provide entities with more flexibility in applying the fair value option on adoption of the credit impairment standard . asu 2018-19 and asu 2019-05 have the same effective date and transition requirements as asu 2016-13. asu 2016-13 will be effective for all entities except public companies that are not smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2022 , including interim periods within those fiscal years , using a modified retrospective approach . early adoption is permitted . we plan to adopt asu 2016-13 and related updates as of january 1 , 2023. we are evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements . in august 2018 , the fasb issued asu 2018-13 , fair value measurement ( topic 820 ) ( â€œ asu 2018-13 â€ ) , which modifies , removes and adds certain disclosure requirements on fair value measurements based on the fasb concepts statement , conceptual framework for financial reportingâ€”chapter 8 : notes to financial statements . the asu is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending december 31 , 2020 , and all annual and interim reporting period thereafter . the amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses , the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level 3 fair value measurements and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption . all other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date . early adoption is permitted upon issuance of asu 2018-13. an entity is permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of asu 2018-13 and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date . we early adopted the guidance related to removal of disclosures upon issuance of this asu and adopted the deferred provisions as permitted under the asu in the first quarter of 2020. the adoption of asu 2018-13 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements . in november 2018 , the fasb issued asu 2018-18 , collaborative arrangements ( topic 808 ) â€œ clarifying the interaction between topic 808 and topic 606 , â€ which requires transactions in collaborative arrangements to be accounted for under asc 606 if the counterparty is a customer for a good or service that is a distinct unit of account . the new standard also precludes an entity from presenting consideration from transactions with a collaborator that is not a customer together with revenue recognized from contracts with customers . the asu is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending december 31 , 2020 , and all annual and interim reporting period thereafter . early adoption is permitted , but no earlier than an entity 's adoption date of topic 606. this asu requires retrospective adoption to the date we adopted asc 606 , january 1 , 2018 , by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the earliest annual period presented . we may elect to apply the asu retrospectively either to all contracts or 56 only to contracts that are not completed at the date it initially applied asc 606. we adopted asu 2018-18 as of january 1 , 2020. the adoption of asu 2018-18 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements . in december 2019 , the fasb issued asu 2019-12 , income taxes ( topic 740 ) : simplifying the accounting for income taxes . the amendments in asu 2019-12 are intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes . asu 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in topic 740 and also clarifies and amends

","As of March 31, 2020, a license agreement with Rezolute was amended to extend the payment schedule for $2.6 million in future cash payments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, spreading the payments into seven quarterly installments through September 30, 2021. The agreement stipulated that if Rezolute completed a qualified financing during this period, all outstanding amounts would be payable within 15 days. In Q1 2020, $0.4 million was received, with additional $0.4 million payments in Q2 and Q3. On October 9, 2020, Rezolute raised $41 million in a private placement, triggering the acceleration of $1.4 million in receivables, which was fully collected in October 2020. The ongoing pandemic has posed risks to business operations, potentially delaying revenue from milestones and leading to impairment charges. As of December 31, 2020, $7.6 million in milestone contingencies were not recorded on the balance sheet due to uncertainties. The company is also preparing to adopt new accounting standards related to credit losses and fair value measurements, effective January 1, 2023, which may impact financial statements."
129,"subject to receiving approval for the pain indication pursuant to our nda , we plan to submit an nda supplement , or snda , for dextenza for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation . we have also completed two phase 3 clinical trials of dextenza for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis . in october 2015 , we announced topline results of our first phase 3 clinical trial for allergic conjunctivitis , and in june 2016 we announced topline results of our second phase 3 clinical trial for this indication . finally , dextenza is in phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of dry eye disease . we announced topline results from an exploratory phase 2 clinical trial for this indication in december 2015. we are assessing our plans for our dry eye program going forward and may focus future efforts on an intracanalicular insert containing an immunosuppressant drug . 116 otx-tp our second product candidate , otx-tp , incorporates travoprost , an fda-approved prostaglandin analog that reduces elevated intraocular pressure , or iop , as its active pharmaceutical ingredient , into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting intracanalicular insert . otx-tp is being developed as a treatment for glaucoma and ocular hypertension . we reported topline results from a phase 2b clinical trial for this indication in october 2015. we completed an end-of-phase 2 review with the fda in april 2016 and initiated the first of two phase 3 clinical trials of otx-tp in september 2016. back-of-the-eye programs in addition to dextenza and otx-tp , we are engaged in the preclinical development of our hydrogel depot administered via intravitreal injection to address the large and growing markets for diseases and conditions of the back of the eye . our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs , such as protein-based anti-vegf drugs or small molecule drugs , such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors , or tkis , for the treatment of retinal diseases such as wet amd , retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema . our initial goal for these programs is to provide extended delivery of a protein-based large molecule or small molecule tki drug targeting vegf and other targets over a four to six month period following administration of a bioresorbable hydrogel incorporating the drug by an injection into the vitreous humor , thereby reducing the frequency of the current monthly or bi-monthly intravitreal injection regimen for wet amd and other retinal diseases and potentially providing a more consistent uniform release of drug over the treatment period . regeneron collaboration in october 2016 , we entered into a strategic collaboration , option and license agreement , or collaboration agreement , with regeneron for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with regeneron 's large molecule vegf-targeting compounds for the treatment of retinal diseases , with the initial focus on the vegf trap aflibercept , currently marketed under the brand name eylea . the collaboration agreement does not cover the development of any products that deliver small molecule drugs , including tkis , for any target including vegf , or any products that deliver large molecule drugs other than those that target vegf proteins . we granted regeneron an option , or the option , to enter into an exclusive , worldwide license under our intellectual property to develop and commercialize products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with regeneron 's large molecule vegf-targeting compounds , or licensed products . if the option is exercised , regeneron will conduct further preclinical development and an initial clinical trial under a collaboration plan . we are obligated to reimburse regeneron for certain development costs during the period through the completion of the initial clinical trial , subject to a cap of $ 25 million , which cap may be increased by up to $ 5 million under certain circumstances . regeneron will be responsible for funding an initial preclinical tolerability study . we do not expect our funding requirements to be material over the next twelve months . if regeneron elects to proceed with further development beyond the initial clinical trial , it will be solely responsible for conducting and funding further development and commercialization of product candidates . under the terms of the collaboration agreement , regeneron has agreed to pay us $ 10 million upon exercise of the option . we are also eligible to receive up to $ 145 million per licensed product upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones , including successful results from the first-in-human clinical trial , $ 100 million per licensed product upon first commercial sale of such licensed product and up to $ 50 million based on the achievement of specified sales milestones for all licensed products . in addition , we are entitled to tiered , escalating royalties , in a range from a high-single digit to a low-to-mid teen percentage of net sales of licensed products . resure following our receipt of fda approval for resure sealant , we commercially launched this product in the united states in 2014 , initially through a network of ophthalmology-focused distributors . in early 2017 , we terminated these distributors and hired a contract sales force of four representatives to sell resure sealant . resure sealant is approved to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery and is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the fda for ophthalmic use . in the pivotal clinical trials that formed the basis for fda approval , resure sealant provided superior wound closure and a better safety profile than sutured closure . 117 financial position we have generated limited revenue to date . in the first quarter of 2014 , we began recognizing revenue from sales of resure sealant . all of our sustained drug delivery products are in various phases of clinical and preclinical development . story_separator_special_tag the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates , assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenue , costs and expenses , and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements . on an ongoing basis , we evaluate our estimates and judgments , including those related to revenue recognition , accrued research and development expenses and stock-based compensation . we base our estimates on historical experience , known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report , we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements . revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four criteria are met in accordance with accounting standards codification , or asc , 605 , revenue recognition : persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists ; delivery of goods has occurred through transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership ; the selling price is fixed or determinable ; and collectability is reasonably assured . we record revenue from product sales net of applicable provisions for returns , chargebacks , discounts , wholesaler management fees , government and commercial rebates , and other applicable allowances in the same period in which the related sales are recorded , based on the underlying contract terms . 122 we analyze multiple-element arrangements based on the guidance in asc topic 605-25 , revenue recognitionâ€”multiple-element arrangements , or asc 605-25. pursuant to this guidance , we evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine ( 1 ) the deliverables included in the arrangement and ( 2 ) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting . this evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship . deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and , if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item , delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control . in assessing whether an item has standalone value , we consider factors such as the research , manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace . in addition , we consider whether the collaboration partner can use the other deliverables for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining elements , whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered elements . we allocate arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method . then , we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria in asc 605 to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition . we determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by asc 605-25. accordingly , we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence , or vsoe , of selling price , if available ; third-party evidence , or tpe , of selling price , if vsoe is not available ; or best estimate of selling price , or besp , if neither vsoe nor tpe is available . we typically use besp to estimate the selling price as we generally do not have vsoe or tpe of selling price for our units of accounting . determining the besp for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment . in developing the besp for a unit of accounting , we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors , including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with our customer and estimated costs . we validate the besp for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the besp will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting . we recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in asc 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting . we will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that have standalone value relative to the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement upon delivery . we will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that do not have standalone value relative to the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement over our estimated performance period , as the arrangement would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting . at the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments , we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone . this evaluation includes an assessment of whether : ( 1 ) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone , ( 2 ) the consideration relates solely to past performance , and ( 3 ) the consideration is reasonable relative to all
","the company plans to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Dextenza to treat post-surgical ocular inflammation, pending approval for its pain indication. Dextenza has completed two Phase 3 trials for allergic conjunctivitis, with topline results announced in October 2015 and June 2016. Additionally, Dextenza is in Phase 2 development for dry eye disease, with exploratory results released in December 2015. The second product candidate, OTX-TP, which incorporates the FDA-approved travoprost for glaucoma treatment, reported Phase 2b results in October 2015 and began Phase 3 trials in September 2016. The company is also developing a hydrogel depot for back-of-the-eye diseases, focusing on extended delivery of anti-VEGF drugs over four to six months. In October 2016, a collaboration with Regeneron was established for developing products using this hydrogel with Regeneron's VEGF-targeting compounds, with Regeneron potentially paying $10 million upon option exercise and up to $145 million in milestone payments per licensed product. The company commercially launched Resure Sealant in 2014, the first FDA-approved surgical sealant for ophthalmic use, after initial sales through distributors. Financially, the company has generated limited revenue since recognizing sales from Resure Sealant in Q1 2014, and it does not expect significant funding requirements in the next year."

however , the current market situation has slowed the pace of this activity . altus has no upcoming debt maturities , and the term of its revolving credit facility extends through november of 2023 . 26 the company is projected to be cash flow positive in 2021 following the start-up of php in january of 2021 , with minimal expected future capital requirements . as such , the company believes it has sufficient operating cash flows and liquidity to fund its future capital expenditures and its quarterly dividend declared by the board of directors in december of 2020. the current crisis , however , is still evolving and may become more severe and complex . as a result , the covid-19 pandemic may still materially and adversely affect altus ' results in a manner that is either not currently known or that the company does not currently consider to be a significant risk to its business . for additional information about the business risks relating to the covid-19 pandemic , please refer to part ii , item 1aâ€”risk factors of this annual report on form 10-k. altus midstream operational metrics the company uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of its operations and growth compared to expected plan estimates . these metrics include : throughput volumes and associated revenues ; costs and expenses ; and adjusted ebitda ( as defined below ) . throughput volumes and associated revenues the company 's results are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas gathered , processed , compressed , and or transmitted . for the periods presented , substantially all revenues were generated through fee-based agreements with apache , a related party . the volumes of natural gas that altus gathers or processes in future periods will depend on the production level of apache 's assets in areas altus services and any additional third-party service contracts . the company 's assets were initially constructed to serve apache 's anticipated development of alpine high and its surrounding areas . as such , the amount and pace of upstream development activity by apache will directly impact altus ' aggregate gathering and processing volumes because the production rate of natural gas wells declines over time . apache , as part of its fourth quarter 2019 capital planning review , notified altus of its intention to materially reduce its planned investment in the alpine high play . this notification prompted altus management to assess its long-lived infrastructure assets for impairment given the expected reduction to future throughput volumes . altus subsequently recorded impairments on its gathering , processing , and transmission assets in the fourth quarter of 2019. for further discussion of these impairments , please see note 1â€”summary of significant accounting policies and note 5â€”property , plant and equipment in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv , item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k. in the second quarter of 2020 , shut-ins and unplanned downtime , among other events , had a negative impact on throughput volumes and associated revenues . apache shut in approximately 70 mmcf/d of production in response to low commodity prices , which fell as a result of lower demand and higher uncertainty associated with the covid-19 pandemic . in addition , unplanned downtime to address moisture in the residue pipeline reduced throughput by approximately 40 mmcf/d . these volumes were back on-line at the beginning of the third quarter . in the fourth quarter of 2020 , voluntary , price-related volume curtailments reduced throughput by approximately 26 mmcf/d . story_separator_special_tag key performance metricâ€”ebitda net income before income taxes was $ 79.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , an increase of $ 1.4 billion from a net loss before income taxes of $ 1.3 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2019. the increase in net income before income taxes was primarily driven by an increase of $ 12.6 million in total revenues , $ 39.7 million of higher income from the equity method interest pipelines , a $ 17.9 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses , a $ 1.3 billion decrease in impairment expense , and a $ 25.5 million decrease in depreciation and accretion expense compared to the prior year period ( as discussed above ) . the increases to net income were offset by a $ 27.6 million increase to expense related to the fair value measurement of an embedded derivative at december 31 , 2020 , a $ 3.6 million decrease to interest income , a $ 3.0 million increase to costs of product sales , a $ 2.9 million increase to general administrative expenses , and $ 3.9 million of various other costs of the company . adjusted ebitda increased by $ 104.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2020 compared to the prior year period . adjusted ebitda , which excludes the impacts of depreciation , accretion , impairments , and the changes to the embedded derivative , benefited from an incremental $ 42.8 million increase related to excluding depreciation , and interest in the company 's proportionate share of ebitda from the equity method interest pipelines . this amount was further benefited by a decrease of $ 5.3 million , in aggregate , of various other insignificant costs of the company . for additional information , see the section titled altus midstream operational metricsâ€”adjusted ebita above . story_separator_special_tag has a specified senior long-term debt rating ;

","Altus Midstream operates several key pipelines, including a 2.0 bcf/d capacity gas pipeline (GCX) placed in service in 2019, a 15% equity interest in the Epic Crude Oil Pipeline with a capacity of 600 mbbl/d operational since early 2020, a 26.7% interest in the Permian Highway Pipeline (PHP) with a capacity of 2.1 bcf/d that began operations in January 2021, and a 33% interest in the Shin Oak NGL Pipeline with a capacity of 550 mbbl/d, also operational since 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the energy sector, leading to Apache shutting in approximately 70 mmcf/d of production in Q2 2020 due to low commodity prices, although production resumed in Q3 2020. Altus reported a net income before taxes of $79.8 million for 2020, a $1.4 billion increase from a net loss of $1.3 billion in 2019, driven by a $12.6 million rise in total revenues and a $39.7 million increase in income from equity method interest pipelines. Adjusted EBITDA rose by $104.8 million in 2020, benefiting from a $42.8 million increase related to excluding depreciation.

. critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities and expenses , and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an on-going basis . 46 revenue recognition the company 's revenues are primarily generated from government contracts and grants . the revenue from government contracts and grants is based upon subcontractor costs and internal costs incurred that are specifically covered by the contracts and grants , plus a facilities and administrative rate that provides funding for overhead expenses and management fees . these revenues are recognized when expenses have been incurred by subcontractors or when the company incurs reimbursable internal expenses that are related to the government contracts and grants . research and development costs research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred in accordance with fasb asc 730 , research and development . research and development includes costs such as clinical trial expenses , contracted research and license agreement fees with no alternative future use , supplies and materials , salaries , share-based compensation , employee benefits , equipment depreciation and allocation of various corporate costs . purchased in-process research and development expense represents the value assigned or paid for acquired research and development for which there is no alternative future use as of the date of acquisition . share-based compensation stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price on the date of grant . stock options issued to directors upon re-election vest quarterly for a period of one year ( new director issuances are fully vested upon issuance ) . stock options issued to employees generally vest 25 % on the grant date , then 25 % each subsequent year for a period of three years . these options have a ten year life for as long as the individuals remain employees or directors . in general , when an employee or director terminates their position , the options will expire within three months , unless otherwise extended by the board . from time to time , the company issues restricted shares of common stock to vendors and consultants as compensation for services performed . typically these instruments vest upon issuance and therefore the entire share-based compensation expense is recognized upon issuance to the vendors and or consultants . share-based compensation expense for options , warrants and shares of common stock granted to non-employees has been determined in accordance with fasb asc 505-50 , equity-based payments to non-employees , and represents the fair value of the consideration received , or the fair value of the equity instruments issued , whichever may be more reliably measured . for options that vest over future periods , the fair value of options granted to non-employees is amortized as the options vest . the fair value is remeasured each reporting period until performance is complete . the fair value of each option grant made during 2018 and 2017 was estimated on the date of each grant using the black-scholes option pricing model and is amortized ratably over the option vesting periods , which approximates the service period . 47 income taxes on december 22 , 2017 , the united states ( â€œ u.s. â€ ) government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act ( the â€œ tax act â€ ) . the tax act significantly revises u.s. corporate income taxation by , among other things , lowering the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35.0 % to 21.0 % effective january 1 , 2018. tax reform did not have any impact to the tax provision due to the full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets and the most significant impact on its consolidated financial statements was the reduction of approximately $ 14 million for the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other assets recorded in the 2017 financial statements . such reduction was fully offset by changes to the company 's valuation allowance . in december 2017 , the sec issued staff accounting bulletin 118 , which allows a measurement period , not to exceed one year , to finalize the accounting for the income tax impacts of the tax act . the accounting for the income tax impacts of the tax act is now complete , no additional adjustments were required . deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis . story_separator_special_tag the ages of individuals are provided as of march 20 , 2019 : name age position christopher j. schaber , phd 52

132,"factors that could significantly affect our 2011 outlook include : unseasonable weather conditions affecting consumer demand and the resulting effect on order cancellations and reorders ; changes in mix and volume of full price sales in contrast with closeout product sales ; manufacturing and or transportation capacity constraints ; the variability of input costs across our supply chain ; costs of expedited transportation ; incremental sales through our expanding direct-to-consumer operations , which are not included in backlog ; changes in consumer spending activity and sales fluctuations in our own retail stores ; and fluctuating currency exchange rates . like other branded consumer product companies , our business is heavily dependent upon discretionary consumer spending patterns . continuing high levels of unemployment in our key markets and restricted credit markets for consumers and retailers continue to pose significant challenges and risks . as a result , a more cautious approach by our wholesale customers may persist , resulting in risk of reduction , delay or cancellation of advance orders prior to shipment . over the past two years we have made significant investments in our go-to-market process to position us for growth . among other things we have : sharpened our focus on product innovation ; built a multi-channel direct-to-consumer platform , including expanded retail store and e-commerce operations ; refocused our marketing efforts behind new brand campaigns and media strategies for each of our major brands ; and restructured our sales organizations to build relationships with new partners and strengthen those with existing accounts . as a result of these continuing efforts , we expect our operating expense levels to increase compared to 2010. in addition , we have begun to make improvements to our operational processes , involving significant investments in initiatives to improve our information technology infrastructure and our enterprise data and information management across our organization , which is designed to improve operational flexibility and performance across our supply chain . these investments are the foundation for a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning , or erp , system which began in late 2010 and will accelerate in 2011 and beyond . wholesale backlog we generally solicit orders from wholesale customers and independent distributors for the fall and spring seasons by march 31 and september 30 , respectively , based on ordering deadlines that we establish to aid our efforts to plan manufacturing volumes to meet demand for each of our selling seasons . twice each year we report our backlog of advance orders , representing the results of these seasonal order-taking processes . 28 we typically ship the majority of our advance fall season orders to wholesale customers and independent distributors beginning in late june and continuing through october . similarly , the majority of our advance spring season orders ship to wholesale customers and independent distributors beginning in late december and continuing through late april . generally , orders are subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment . our spring wholesale backlog at september 30 , 2010 ( our most recent seasonal ordering deadline ) increased $ 43.4 million , or 12 % , to $ 394.2 million from $ 350.8 million at september 30 , 2009. changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared with 2009 affected the spring wholesale backlog comparison by less than 1 % . our spring wholesale backlog reflects growth across each major brand , product category and region . the increase in our spring wholesale backlog was led by the united states , followed by the laap region , the emea region and canada . by product category , the spring wholesale backlog increase was led by sportswear , followed by footwear , outerwear and accessories and equipment . by brand , the spring wholesale backlog increase was led by the columbia brand , followed by the sorel brand and the mountain hardwear brand . wholesale backlog does not include anticipated sales to consumers through our own direct-to-consumer channels . although we can not predict with certainty any future results , our reported spring wholesale backlog is one indicator of our anticipated net sales for the spring 2011 selling season . many factors , however , could cause actual wholesale sales to differ materially from the reported spring wholesale backlog , including the potential cancellation of orders by customers , capacity constraints at our independent manufacturing partners ' facilities resulting in delivery delays , changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in macro-economic conditions . moreover , our spring wholesale backlog should not be used in forecasting sales beyond the spring 2011 selling season . results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report . all references to years relate to the calendar year ended december 31. highlights of the year ended december 31 , 2010 net sales increased $ 239.5 million , or 19 % , to $ 1,483.5 million in 2010 from $ 1,244.0 million in 2009. changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared with 2009 contributed approximately one percentage point of benefit to the consolidated net sales comparison . net income increased 15 % to $ 77.0 million in 2010 from $ 67.0 million in 2009 , and diluted earnings per share increased to $ 2.26 in 2010 compared to $ 1.97 in 2009. we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $ 0.74 per share , or $ 24.9 million in aggregate , for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , which included an 11 % increase in the quarterly dividend to $ 0.20 per share from $ 0.18 per share in october 2010. in addition , we paid a special dividend of $ 1.50 per share , or $ 50.5 million in aggregate , in december 2010. cash , cash equivalents and short-term investments as of december 31 , 2010 totaled approximately story_separator_special_tag the decrease in footwear net sales to emea distributors primarily reflects lower columbia-branded product net sales to our largest customer in that region and a shift in the timing of shipments as a smaller percentage of spring 2010 shipments occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 , while a higher percentage of spring 2009 shipments occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. net sales of accessories and equipment increased $ 6.4 million , or 9 % , to $ 74.4 million in 2009 from $ 68.0 million in 2008. accessories and equipment sales growth was concentrated in columbia-branded accessories and equipment and led by the united states and the laap region , followed by canada , partially offset by a decrease in net sales in the emea region . sales by brand replace_table_token_14_th gross profit : gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 42.1 % in 2009 from 43.1 % in 2008. gross profit margins contracted primarily as a result of a higher volume of close-out product sales at lower gross margins and unfavorable hedge rates . selling , general and administrative expense : sg & a expense increased $ 14.3 million , or 3 % , to $ 444.7 million in 2009 from $ 430.4 million in 2008. as a percentage of net sales , sg & a expense increased to 35.7 % of net sales in 2009 from 32.7 % of net sales in 2008. the increase in sg & a expense as a percentage of net sales was largely the result of reduced net sales in our wholesale business coupled with an increased fixed cost base related to our expanding direct-to-consumer operations and increased incentive compensation and professional fees , partially offset by reduced advertising and bad debt expense . selling expenses , including commissions and advertising , decreased $ 17.0 million , or 14 % , to 8.4 % of net sales in 2009 from 9.2 % of net sales in 2008. we attribute the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales to lower commission expense as relationships with certain independent sales agencies in the united states and the emea region have been discontinued and replaced by in-house sales operations . operating expenses for the in-house sales organization are included in general and administrative expenses . 35 general and administrative expenses increased $ 31.3 million , or 10 % , to 27.4 % of net sales in 2009 from 23.4 % of net sales for the comparable period in 2008. the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to incremental operating costs in support our direct-to-consumer initiatives and the expansion of our in-house sales organization , partially offset by lower bad debt expense . depreciation and amortization included in sg & a expense totaled $ 35.5 million for 2009 , compared to $ 30.1 million for the same period in 2008. impairment of acquired intangible assets : we did not incur any impairment of acquired intangible assets in 2009. during the fourth quarter of 2008 , we incurred a $ 24.7 million non-cash pre-tax charge , or approximately $ 0.46 per diluted share after tax , for the write-down of acquired intangible assets related to our acquisitions of the pacific trail and montrail brands in 2006. the impairment charge related primarily to goodwill and trademarks and resulted from our annual evaluation of intangible asset values . these brands had not achieved our sales and profitability objectives and the deterioration in the macro-economic environment and resulting effect on consumer demand have decreased the probability of realizing these objectives in the near future . we remain committed to marketing and distributing montrail-branded footwear through the outdoor specialty , running specialty and sporting goods channels . beginning in 2009 , pacific trail products are sold primarily through licensing arrangements . net licensing income : net licensing income increased $ 2.4 million , or 40 % , to $ 8.4 million in 2009 from $ 6.0 million in 2008. the increase in net licensing income was primarily due to increased apparel and footwear licensing in the laap region . products distributed by our licensees in 2009 included apparel , footwear , leather accessories , eyewear , socks , insulated products including soft-sided coolers , camping gear , bicycles , home products , luggage , watches and other accessories . interest income , net : interest income was $ 2.1 million in 2009 compared to $ 7.6 million in 2008. the decrease in interest income was almost entirely due to significantly lower interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008. interest expense was nominal in 2009 and 2008. income tax expense : our provision for income taxes decreased to $ 22.8 million in 2009 from $ 31.2 million in 2008. this decrease resulted from lower income before tax , partially offset by an increase in our effective income tax rate to 25.4 % in 2009 compared to 24.7 % in 2008. our 2009 effective tax rate varied from the u.s. statutory rate due to foreign tax credits and the favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions . story_separator_special_tag canadian dollars , japanese yen or korean won as their functional currency . we manage this risk primarily by using currency forward and option contracts . additionally , we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge net balance sheet exposures related primarily to intercompany loan agreements and payables . the fair value of our hedging contracts was unfavorable by approximately $ 2.2 million and $ 0.4 million at december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . a 10 % change in the euro , canadian dollar , yen and won exchange rates would have resulted in the fair value fluctuating approximately $ 10.9 million at december 31 , 2010 and $ 9.7 million at december 31 , 2009. changes in fair value resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations would be substantially offset by the change in value of
","The company's outlook for 2011 is influenced by several factors, including unseasonable weather, changes in sales mix, manufacturing and transportation constraints, fluctuating input costs, and currency exchange rates. High unemployment and restricted credit markets pose risks to discretionary consumer spending, potentially leading to cautious behavior from wholesale customers, which may result in order cancellations or delays. The spring wholesale backlog as of September 30, 2010, increased by $43.4 million (12%) to $394.2 million compared to the previous year, with growth across all major brands and regions, particularly in the U.S. The company reported net sales of $1,483.5 million in 2010, a 19% increase from $1,244.0 million in 2009, with net income rising 15% to $77.0 million. The diluted earnings per share increased to $2.26 from $1.97. The company paid $24.9 million in dividends and a special dividend of $50.5 million in December 2010. Investments in direct-to-consumer operations and IT infrastructure are expected to increase operating expenses compared to 2010. The company is also implementing a new global ERP system, which began in late 2010. Overall, while the spring wholesale backlog indicates potential sales growth, various external factors could lead to significant deviations from expected results."
