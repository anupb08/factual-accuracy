Already the government has used up over 95 per cent of the deficit target or the market borrowings as of October end. The report comes even as the government is asking the Reserve Bank to lower the minimum capital requirements by getting it at par with global practices-something the central bank is uncomfortable to meet.

Japan's Nikkei managed to edge up 0.4 percent, but MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was all but flat. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 eased back 0.35 percent, after rising sharply overnight. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he expects to move ahead with raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent currently. Trump said it was ""highly unlikely"" he would accept China's request to hold off on the increase, planned for Jan. 1. The comments ran counter to recent speculation about a possible deal when Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this week. ""Trump's pessimistic view on the chances of a game-changing China trade deal may puncture global equity markets' optimistic start to the week,"" said Sean Callow, a senior FX analyst at Westpac in Sydney. ""Combined with last week's harsh report from the U.S. trade representative, investors have only the flimsiest hope that the Trump-Xi meeting in Argentina will amount to more than a hill of soybeans.

FIIs are not only selling in the cash market, they are also betting on the short side via the F&O market,” he said. Gupta added that FIIs have 60% net short positions in the index futures and these shorts may help in the short-covering rally if something major positive comes up in the Budget.","the Nifty has slipped more than 1 percent, so far, in January, and about 3 percent from the record high of 12,430 recorded on January [NUM].",20,20,TRUE

Kolkata: Reliance Jio Infocomm is poised to race ahead of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to emerge as India’s No. 1 telco by revenue share and customers by 2021 and 2022, respectively, brokerage Sanford C Bernstein said. The Mukesh Ambani-led telco, it said, would relentlessly continue to subsidise its popular 4G VoLTE feature phone, called JioPhone, till these twin goals are realised. “Shareholders of Reliance Industries (Jio’s parent) are not complaining, preferring to see Jio continuing to gain share, and we believe neither Airtel nor Vodafone Idea have the stomach to engage in a pointless subsidy war,” Bernstein said in a note to clients. The global brokerage, in fact, expects the two older carriers to look forward to a time when Jio would start monetising its (customer) base through higher pricing after wresting market leadership. Jio’s pricing aggression since its entry in September 2016 forced incumbents to match rates to retain customers, galvanising consumption of voice and data services. Big incumbent carriers were hurt, while fringe players that couldn’t withstand the brutal price war exited and the sector consolidated down to three large private players — Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, among the older ones, and Jio. More recently, strong performances in crucial states and rural mobile markets, have seen Jio boost revenue market share (RMS) by as much as 375 basis points (bps) sequentially to over 26% at the end of September. By contrast, Airtel’s RMS dipped 75 bps to 30.9% amid revenue losses in seven key markets, while VIL’s plunged 190 bps on-quarter to 32.8%, amid revenue slides nearly across India. Jio’s recent Monsoon Hungama offer of exchanging any old feature phone for a JioPhone for about `1,000 (including six months recharge) also proved a runaway hit with users of plain vanilla phones who upgraded to 4G and contributed to the sharp upsurge in the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco’s subscriber base in the September quarter. Airtel’s refusal to fight Jio in the VoLTE feature phone space has come at a heavy price.","mukesh ambani-led telco will continue to subsidise its popular [NUM]G VoLTE feature phone, called JioPhone, till these twin goals are realised.",4,4,TRUE

While some broadcasters are developing theme-based edits of existing content, and bringing back iconic shows, others are resorting to reruns of popular shows, and testing the viability of using video conferencing tools to create content. The Indian film and television industry had decided to halt shoots as a preventive measure until March 31. But the 21-day national lockdown has imposed a longer moratorium on the industry. With a content repository that could last only four weeks, most broadcasters had run out of fresh content by March end. Riding on nostalgia

Bringing back old shows seems to be broadcasters’ best bet. Public broadcaster Doordarshan led the trend by bringing back iconic shows such as Ramayan, Circus, Byomkesh Bakshi and Shaktiman, among others. Viacom18 is airing reruns of its marquee non-fiction show Bigg Boss (Season 13) at 10 pm every day on Colors. Zee TV is replacing its prime time shows Kumkum Bhagya and Kundali Bhagya with a few finite web series namely, Karrle Tu Bhi Mohabbat, Baarish, Kehne Ko Humsafar Hain, which were first streamed on ALTBalaji.

56,20,,"Saudi Arabia's decision to shelve what was billed as the biggest share sale ever is a major blow to the credibility of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman but there are other ways to fice reforms to strengthen the economy, bankers and investors say. The initial public offering (IPO) of 5 percent of state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco was a centrepiece of the crown prince's plan to diversify the kingdom's economy beyond oil by raising $100 billion for investment in other sectors. The 32 year old ruler, widely known as MbS, also promised that listing Saudi Aramco on international stock markets would help create a culture of openness in the secretive kingdom and make it more appealing to foreign investors. The decision to shelve the IPO raises doubts about the management of the process as well as the broader reform agenda, sapping the momentum generated by Prince Mohammed's dramatic 2030 Vision announcement in 2016 that helped propel him to power in the world's top oil exporter. ""The problem is: the more it gets delayed and the more there's not clarity on why it's getting delayed and what the issues are, the more it undermines confidence,"" said James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS https://www.rsis.edu.sg). ""He's been very good at creating expectations but not as good at managing expectations,"" said Dorsey. Industry sources told Reuters this week that both the international and domestic legs of the IPO had been postponed indefinitely. Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the government remained committed to conducting the IPO at an unspecified date in the future. ""The reform process has to be judged on its entirety and over a period of years but this will negatively affect perceptions of its credibility overall, considering that the IPO was promised in such high-profile terms,"" said Richard Segal, senior analyst at Manulife Asset Management in London.

86,29,,"State Bank of India, the nation’s largest lender, sees provisioning for soured debt as the biggest challenge for the South Asian nation’s banking system even as credit growth is reviving from a three-decade low. “Whatever process we resort to for the resolution of non-performing assets there will be a gap in the provisioning,” Chairman Rajnish Kumar said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday. “That is precisely where the support from the government is required. For the banking system to come out of the problem we have to provide for those loan losses that have been incurred.”

Kumar is at the forefront of helping clean up the worst soured-debt ratio among the world’s biggest economies. Overdue loans have dragged economic growth to the lowest since 2014, piling pressure on the government to revive activity before elections next year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has pledged to inject $33 billion of fresh capital into struggling state-run banks — including SBI — and the Reserve Bank of India has asked commercial lenders to resolve bad loans at 40 of the biggest defaulters within a year. Policy makers are betting these moves will boost loan growth from a 30-year low. Rate Outlook

“Banks need to recapitalize, write down bad debts and be in a stronger position first,” Kumar said, referring to the government’s plan to merge some state-run banks. “We need to create a few more large banks in the country as the gap between SBI and others is very wide.” State Bank, which accounts for more than a fifth of India’s banking assets, broke into the ranks of the world’s top 50 lenders in April after it merged with five smaller units and","overdue loans have dragged economic growth to the lowest since [NUM], piling pressure on the government to revive activity before elections next year.",2014,2014,TRUE

With fresh take up of spaces likely to be limited, landlords might have to sit on locked in capital (completed buildings) for a relatively longer time period.

Q) Franklin Templeton has shut down six credit risk strategy debt funds. This is the second casualty of the coronavirus outbreak after IndiaNivesh. Do you think investors will again lose faith like they did after the 2008 ficial crisis? A) Investors currently are in a state of fear and shock but during such a crisis causalities do happen and the credit risk of debt funds is a natural extension of a liquidity crisis. Therefore, this is not a systematic crisis but is considered a part and parcel of such downtrends. However, it is an eye-opener for the RBI that despite its liquidity efforts, these measures are either insufficient or are not effective in de-freezing the liquidity crisis. Hopefully, now that the credit risk debt fund crisis has occurred, it is expected that things will be taken care of at the regulatory end. Q)","What can the government do to mitigate the credit crisis that led to the winding down of Franklin Templeton schemes?

A) There is a lot that the government needs to do to bring back confidence and trust in the economy but all wishes cannot be granted. The minimum -- the government should take on the risk of credit defaults of SMEs and MSMEs such that they are able to access fresh line of credit to revive their depleting businesses. This is similar to the government having credited a sum of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 a month for three months for farmers and women in their Jan Dhan accounts directly.

Q) A volatile week for Indian markets but the Nifty managed to hold on to 9,000, supported by some positive global cues and expectations of a stimulus package. But it looks like 9,300 is a crucial resistance level for the Nifty50. What are your views on the market?

A) 9,300 is indeed a crucial level for the Nifty and acts as strong resistance as it is nothing but 38 percent retracement of the market’s recent fall as per Fibonacci’s retracement levels. Such levels assume importance because even international markets are hovering around similar retracement levels. Unless we see substantial improvement in the situation on both – the COVID-19 front and the business resumption front-- we believe 9,300 will be a strong resistance level.",a volatile week for india but the Nifty managed to hold on to [NUM].,"9,000","9,000",TRUE

Chennai/Mumbai: The Tata Group may eliminate jobs at some of its businesses to save fixed costs as it grapples with falling profits due to the coronavirus pandemic, and global economic projections pointing to a challenging time ahead. The pandemic had led to a suspension of the conglomerate’s several businesses — including aerospace, automotive and aviation — depressing its earnings in key markets across the world.

111,35,,"NEW DELHI: The rupee was a bundle of nerves at the open on Friday as it sank 24 paise to a 13-month low of 66.06 against the dollar, hit by rising crude prices and fiscal deficit worries.

If the RBI does raise rates, it would be the latest in a series of emerging market central banks that have been pressured into tightening policy in response to a tumbling currency. Fortunately for the RBI, the economy is doing well. The Indian economy is forecast to expand by an annual rate of more than 7 percent every quarter for the next two years, although slower than the surprise 8.2 percent rate clocked last quarter. This means that India will remain the world's fastest growing major economy, but economists have chopped forecasts somewhat for coming quarters. ""Although the high growth rate in Q2 might be partly attributed to favourable base effects ... the underlying dynamics of the Indian economy shows that virtually all high-frequency data is flashing green,"" said Hugo Erken, senior economist at Rabobank. Prices of crude oil - the country's biggest import have surged by over 20 percent this year. That in turn has swollen the current account gap to 1.9 percent of GDP, swinging to deficit from a small surplus of 0.7 percent a year ago.","That gap is forecast to widen further to 2.8 percent of GDP by the fiscal year ending in March 2019, before easing slightly to 2.5 percent in 2019-20.

Just over half of 49 respondents who answered an additional question said the biggest economic risk over the coming year was higher fuel prices. The escalating US-China trade war has not had a major impact on India so far but has spurred on a broad selloff in emerging market assets since the beginning of this year. The sharp fall in the rupee has not stirred much worry about inflation, however, which was just under 3.7 percent in August, slightly below the 4 percent where the RBI prefers it to be. It is expected to average 4.1 percent this quarter and next, but rise to 5 percent by the middle of 2019 - significantly lower than the predictions in the last poll two months ago. Economists were almost evenly split on whether a weaker rupee posed the biggest upside risk to inflation, with 26 of 51 respondents saying it was. But even if the RBI raises rates on October 4, it will still struggle to keep up with the Fed, which is expected to keep tighten policy well into next year. ""The RBI will have to do more, though that looks unlikely on the grounds of on-target inflation and stress in the ficial sector,"" Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING, wrote in a research note.",rupee has tumbled nearly [NUM] percent since start of year.,15,3.7,FALSE
121,38,"The Reserve Bank of India is likely to raise interest rates in early October, despite relatively tame inflation, to prop up a retreating rupee, according to a Reuters poll of economists who also trimmed their near-term growth forecasts. In an abrupt change from the last survey conducted two months ago, which predicted rates would stay on hold until this quarter next year, two-thirds of 61 economists polled September 19-25 said the RBI would lift the repo rate at least once by year-end. Slightly over half said RBI Governor Urjit Patel and the Monetary Policy Committee would deliver a 25-basis-point rise to 6.75 percent at the October 5 policy meeting, with one economist calling for a 50-basis-point rise. The predicted rate hike would be the RBI's third this year, having lifted borrowing costs in June and August. The US Federal Reserve is forecast to raise rates this week - its third this year - according a separate Reuters poll. For many analysts, the retreating Indian rupee, which has tumbled nearly 15 percent since the start of the year and is the worst-performing major Asian currency, is likely of concern to policymakers. On Tuesday the rupee, hit recently by growing credit concerns engulfing non-banking ficial companies, was trading at 72.68 to the dollar. The fice ministry also wants RBI to boost liquidity. ""For the RBI, I think it becomes necessary to provide a policy response. The question was only of timing,"" said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS in Singapore.","""Some would say it (rate hike) could have come sooner ... it probably would have been a bit more beneficial.

156,52,"According to Icra’s findings, in FY2020, 43% of the respondents witnessed volume degrowth > 25%. Dealers in few states like Karnataka and Bihar reported volume growth between 5 and 5%. Tough ficing environment and liquidity strain in the market made it difficult for majority of the dealers to secure funding, thereby impacting sales to some extent during FY2020.

Majority of the respondents indicated that funds flow from the government was weak. While central government payment was flowing, payments from state governments were stuck, which, in turn, impacted CE demand. As for rental demand, 50% of the respondents said it was in line with previous years while 30% felt otherwise, which impacted fresh CE buying to a certain extent. Sales during March was severely impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown as 83% of the respondents witnessed volume degrowth of more than 60% (in some cases as much as 80-90%). Typically, March of every fiscal is the best month during which the CE sales witnesses a surge in volumes. But this was not the case in FY2020, which lead to relatively higher inventory holding. Currently, 85% of the respondents hold more than one month of inventory, thereby adding to higher interest costs for Q1FY2021. Despite tight conditions, dealers received timely funds from ficiers for sales during February and March, even while the lockdown impacted sales in March.","Nearly 71% of the respondents expect demand to revive during Q3 FY2021, after Q2 FY2021, which is typically a lean period for the industry on account of monsoons. The extent of volume degrowth during FY2021 remains uncertain given current market conditions; 50% respondents expect volumes to decline by 15-25% while 29% expect volumes to remain flattish. Emission norm change (on production of engines >50HP) to TREM IV standards for backhoe loaders and wheeled loaders is scheduled for October. More than 70% respondents expect the emission norm changes to be implemented as scheduled. More than 85% respondents expect cost of the equipment to increase by 5-10% given the upfront investments incurred by OEMs to implement emission norm changes in wheeled loaders and backhoe loaders. Pavethra Ponniah, VP and sector head, Icra, said, “Apart from the impact of the lockdown during March to May, Covid-19 has crippled several industries and eroded livelihoods. Weakness in government revenues streams, more so at the states; redirected government support to healthcare, possibly at the cost of all other capital spends; the need for structural changes incorporating social distancing in several industries like construction; movement of labour and material; and the cost of restarting the economy — all these thwart the ability to make forecasts for sectors intrinsically linked to the underlying economy.

169,55,"The rapidly growing novel coronavirus pandemic is so far having little impact on the global food supply chain, but that could change for the worse and soon if anxiety-driven panic by major food importers takes hold, the World Food Programme (WFP) has said. In a new report, “COVID-19: Potential impact on the world’s poorest people: A WFP analysis of the economic and food security implications of the pandemic”, the UN agency said global markets for basic cereals are well-supplied and prices generally low. However, given the highly globalised nature of food production and supply, commodities need to move from the world’s ‘breadbaskets’ to where they are consumed and the novel coronavirus-related containment measures are starting to make this more challenging. “Disruptions are so far minimal; food supply is adequate, and markets are relatively stable,” WFP Senior Spokesperson Elizabeth Byrs said, noting that global cereal stocks are at comfortable levels and the outlook for wheat and other staple crops is positive for the rest of the year. “But we may soon expect to see disruptions in food supply chains,” she said, explaining that if big importers lose confidence in the reliable flow of basic food commodities, panic buying could ensue, driving prices up. A grain market analyst at the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), quoted anonymously in the report, said the problem is not supply, but “a behavioural change over food security”. “What if bulk buyers think they can’t get wheat or rice shipments in May or June? That is what could lead to a global food supply crisis,” the analyst said. For low-income countries, the consequences could be devastating, with long-term repercussions, with coping strategies coming at the expense of such essential services as health and education. It recalled that when a food price crisis struck in 2008, the world’s poorest households ?","which typically spend the largest share of income on food ? suffered disproportionately. Using the economic pillar of the Proteus food security index – and taking into account dependency on primary commodities such as fuel, ores and metals for export earnings – the report said that countries in Africa and the Middle East are most vulnerable. Africa accounts for the majority of the almost 212 million people in the world who are chronically food insecure and the 95 million who live amidst acute food insecurity, the report said. Byrs said labour shortages could disrupt the production and processing of labour-intensive crops in particularly, especially in vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Other potential sources of disruption include blockages along transport routes ? a particular concern for fresh produce ? and quarantine measures that could impede farmers’ access to markets. Going forward, the WFP report said, it is essential to monitor food prices and markets, and to transparently disseminate information ? thus helping to strengthen government policies while also averting public panic, and social unrest.",[NUM] million people in the world are chronically food insecure.,212,212,TRUE

186,59,"Japan’s decision to release radioactive contaminated water from its wrecked nuclear plant in Fukushima into the sea by 2022 has led to alarm bells ringing in India with experts warning it would set a wrong precedent and impact aquatic and human life along coastal belts of several parts of the world. The contamits of the massive quantities of nuclear water will include radioactive isotopes such as cesium, tritium, cobalt and carbon-12 and may take from 12 to 30 years to decay. It will destroy everything it comes in contact with almost immediately and cripple the economy related to the fishing industry and lead to a spectrum of diseases, including cancer. “This will be the first incident of high volumes of radioactive water being released in the sea and can set a wrong precedent for others to follow. Concerns related to the environment and health are crucial for the existence of the human race. Therefore, alternative arrangements may be debated globally,” A K Singh, director general of health science at the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO), told PTI. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the north-eastern coast of Japan, triggering a 15-metre tsunami that damaged the 5,306 MW Fukushima nuclear plant. It is the second biggest nuclear disaster in the history of nuclear power generation after Chernobyl in 1986. After the accident, 1.2 million tonnes of radioactive contaminated water released from the reactors in over 1,000 tanks were kept in a cordoned off large area near the Fukushima plant. However, authorities are running out of space as the plant is to be decommissioned and the Japanese government has decided to release the radioactive contaminated water in the sea starting 2022.","The decision to release the radioactive water was taken on October 16, 2020 after years of debate. Singh, among the Indian government’s top nuclear health scientists, said the release of contaminated water into the ocean will directly impact human and aquatic life. “The possibility of ingestion of tritium in humans will increase and since this isotope will distribute in all organs in humans and long. Radioactivity monitoring in fish and other aquatic life in near vicinity (coastal areas) and drinking water will be necessary. Deposition of the radioactive elements on the rocks has also to be seen,” he said. While Japanese authorities have said the water would be diluted before being released and it would only contain only tritium, other health experts who have been monitoring the issue said the risk involved should never be undermined. Yudhyavir Singh, assistant professor of anaesthesia and critical care at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said the risks will depend entirely on the amount of the contamits present in the nuclear wastewater and their nature. “Mostly contamits are radioactive isotopes which include cesium, cobalt, carbon-14 and tritium. The half-life of cesium is 30 years, it will take 30 years of half of the material to decay.

195,63,,"Economic growth is about increasing the value of measurable economic activities, and is a convenient (if overemphasised) proxy for increases in welfare. One can measure aggregate economic activity by capturing its components, valuing them and adding them up, either from the perspective of expenditure, or income. India’s pandemic lockdown brought a forced halt to a large fraction of economic activity, so national income and expenditure would naturally take a big hit. The problem in such circumstances, aside from the fundamental issue of basic survival for many people affected by the loss of income, is that such reductions have ripple or multiplier effects, deepening and prolonging the initial loss. This phenomenon led to the Great Depression of the 1930s, and that traumatic time helped to change the way in which appropriate economic policy responses were conceived. In particular, government was recognised as being uniquely able to spend in bad times (including transferring money to its citizens, who would do the actually spending in that case), to cushion first-order income losses and their even more substantial ripple effects. Every government has been responding in this manner to pandemic-caused halts to economic activity. In previous columns, I reported what I thought was a broad consensus view, that the Indian government’s fiscal response has been inadequate, given the hit taken by the economy as a result of the lockdown. It has been a bit difficult to estimate the overall impact of government measures, in terms of net fiscal “stimulus”, but a dozen or so different analysts reported numbers mostly ranging around 1% of GDP (the standard measure of aggregate economic activity). Recently, however, Surjit Bhalla, who holds a very important position as India’s Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), provided a headline number of a 5% fiscal package.",[NUM]% fiscal package was announced by the international monetary fund.,5,5,TRUE
196,63,"He argued that this is one of the largest responses among all economies in the world, and that India is now “Ready for Growth”. I hope he is correct, but given the importance of this issue for the Indian economy going forward, the basic issue of how much the government is supporting aggregate economic activity seems to be worth re-examining, before one gets into issues of the quality of structural reforms and long-run growth prospects. Bhalla bases his estimate on the IMF Policy Tracker, which reports its own estimates of various components of the government’s economic package. He reports added expenditure of 3.5% for poor households, migrant workers and agriculture, plus another half percent transfer to state governments, together totalling 4% or so. The headline number is not derived explicitly, but is supported by some qualitative arguments, including methodological disagreements with all the analysts who preceded him. The methodological issues seem to be complex, and include issues of where spending gets counted, and whether certain kinds of guarantees indirectly support spending that would otherwise not have taken place. Who is more accurate? Reviewing one analysis, as reported in The Wire on May 17, provides a detailed calculation of a direct fiscal stimulus of 1% of GDP, much less than the IMF numbers, the sources of which are not provided. More recently, Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India and chairman of the National Statistical Commission, has also offered calculations that amount to around a 1% fiscal stimulus, possibly doubled by multiplier effects. Using a consistent approach, he estimates the corresponding response to the 2008-09 crisis, which was much less severe, at 3% of GDP.","Yet, another detailed and thoughtful evaluation of the entire economic package, by Rajeswari Sengupta and Harsh Vardhan (like Sen’s analysis, available at http://www.ideasforindia.in) concludes that the incremental government spending in the overall package is less than 2% of GDP. Several analysts of the temporary shock to economic activity estimate its magnitude at 10% or more of annual GDP for 2020-21. In that case, even a 5% stimulus would be inadequate, and the bulk of analyses indicate that even allowing for indirect effects, the total package the government has come up with is less than that. On the bright side, the monetary policy response has been more appropriate, but monetary policy measures are not as direct as putting money into people’s pockets, and the distributional impacts are also less favourable than when money is transferred to the poor. I have not been able to find an official government analysis, or a rebuttal of academic and private sector analyses of the economic package, beyond the government’s own discourse and framing. The issue is not one of politics or of the quality and impact of economic reforms: it is a basic question of what the government is actually planning and accomplishing in its efforts to engineer an economic recovery from the lockdown. India will resume growth, but the questions are how much and how soon, and what will be the ultimate economic cost in terms of lost income and welfare. The answers depend on what the government does, and, at least to me, it is not clear that it is doing the best it can.

The assessment by the National Sample Survey Office conducted between July 2017-June 2018, showed the unemployment rate stood at 6.1 percent, the highest since 1972-73, Business Standard reported. The survey has become a political issue after the acting chairman and another member of the body that reviewed the job data resigned saying there was delay in its release. The head of the government-funded National Statistical Commission P.C. Moha said on Wednesday that he and colleague J. Meenakshi were unhappy at the non-publication of jobs data that had been due for release in December and alleged interference by other state agencies over backdated GDP data. Business Standard said the report showed that joblessness stood at 7.8 percent in urban areas compared with 5.3 parts in the countryside. The data is significant because this was the first comprehensive assessment of India’s employment situation conducted after Modi’s decision in November 2016 to withdraw most of the country’s banknotes from circulation overnight, the report said. India’s economy has been expanding by 7 percent plus annually — the fastest pace among major economies — but the uneven growth has meant there are not enough jobs created for millions of young Indians entering the workforce each year.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 98 cents, or 4.4 percent, at $21.43 after dropping as much as 5 percent following a 1.5 percent decline in the previous session. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with Russia and other producing countries - a grouping known as OPEC+ - agreed over Easter to cut output by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in May and June, equating to about 10 percent of global supply before the coronavirus outbreak. Additional output cuts by the United States, the world's biggest producer, and other nations outside the OPEC+ group will take the estimated total reduction to about 19.5 million bpd. ""With demand destruction forecasts ranging from 15 million to 22 million bpd in April 2020 and these measures not even coming into place until May, we are likely to see a substantial overhang in the short-term,"" said Nitesh Shah, director of research at New York-based WisdomTree Investments.

India likely to witness second wave of coronavirus; in high-risk group: Nomura

India's decision to unlock the world's longest coronavirus-induced lockdown in a phased-manner might turn detrimental in the upcoming days.

And, in extreme cases, it could lead to the situation of re-locking. India may lose Rs 10-lakh crore revenue due to coronavirus: Gadkari

Union Transport and Highway Minister Nitin Gadkari said that economic war against coronavirus pandemic has started in India and that the COVID-19 outbreak would cause a humongous loss to the country's revenue. Gadkari, who was addressing his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s Jan Samvad virtual rally from Nagpur on Wednesday, stated that India was expected to lose revenue of Rs 10 lakh crore due to coronavirus outbreak. Cash withdrawal from ATMs falls nearly 50% in April

Cash withdrawals from automated teller machines (ATMs) nearly halved to about Rs 1.27 lakh crore during April, mainly on account of the impact of the coronavirus-induced lockdown.

263,84,"LONDON: Britain is unlikely to lift its stringent lockdown rules until the end of May, a leading government adviser said on Saturday, warning that the spread of the coronavirus must first slow and intense testing be introduced. The government has put Britain into a widespread shutdown, closing pubs, restaurants and nearly all shops, while ordering people to stay home unless absolutely essential to venture out. The order is designed to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country, which has almost 40,000 confirmed cases and 3,605 deaths, but some experts have started to question whether the shuttering of the economy will cost more lives in the long run. ""We want to move to a situation where at least by the end of May we're able to substitute some less intensive measures, more based on technology and testing, for the complete lockdown we have now,"" Neil Ferguson, a leading professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London, told BBC Radio. Britain initially took a restrained approach to the outbreak but Prime Minister Boris Johnson changed tack and imposed stringent social-distancing measures after Ferguson's modelling showed a quarter of a million people in the country could die. The response has since been hampered by a lack of ventilators and an inability to carry out mass testing to determine whether the public, and particularly health workers, have built up an immunity. A second senior government adviser, the chief pandemic modeller Graham Medley, said he feared Britain had painted itself into a corner, with no clear exit from a strategy that would damage the economic and mental well-being of many people. Almost one million people have applied for welfare benefits in just two weeks in Britain, according to official data that shows the economy is set for a depression that could be worse than the slump in the 1930s. ""If we carry on with lockdown it buys us more time, we can get more thought put into it, but it doesn't resolve anything - it's a placeholder,"" Medley told the Times newspaper.""We've","kind of painted ourselves into a corner, because then the question will be, what do we do now? In broad terms are we going to continue to harm children to protect vulnerable people, or not?""Health minister Matt Hancock has set a goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month, a tenfold increase that industry leaders have questioned due to shortages of specialist chemicals and testing kits. It is also considering immunity certificates. Medley said the antibody tests could help but were not working so far. Separately the government said it would free prisoners who were deemed to be low risk and were within weeks of release. Prime Minister Johnson, who has been in self-isolation after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, said he would invite opposition party leaders to a briefing next week with Britain's chief medical officer and scientific adviser. ""As party leaders we have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency,"" he said.",a ten-year target of [NUM] tests per day is set for this month.,"1,00,000","1,00,000",TRUE

The Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc across ficial markets. Even the hitherto steady fixed income market is shaken. Investors are concerned about credit quality and liquidity of the underlying instruments. In such unbridled times, we review the banking and PSU (public sector undertaking) category, which invest 80% of their assets in debt instruments of banks, PSUs, public ficial institutions (PFIs) and municipal bodies. Better credit & liquidity profile

These funds primarily invest in top-rated instruments of the debt market—bonds and debentures issued by banks, PSUs and PFIs—thus providing a better credit profile for investment compared to most other mutual fund categories. Credit quality comparison among debt funds ranked in the CRISIL Mutual Fund Ranking of March 2020 shows that banking and PSU funds have predominately invested in top-rated papers versus most other categories with portfolio average maturity above one year. Average exposure of these funds to AAA rated papers stood at 92% in April 2020. Exposure to similar AAA papers stood at 53% for medium duration funds, 72% for dynamic bond funds, 84% for short duration funds and 91% for medium to long duration funds, while long duration and corporate bond funds had higher exposure at 97% and 98%, respectively. In addition to having higher investments in top-rated papers, the category had the least amount of investments in securities that had ‘negative’ or ‘watch negative’ outlook by rating agencies.

Even as states begin to reopen for business, a further 2.4 million workers joined the nation’s unemployment rolls last week, and there is growing concern among economists that many of the lost jobs are gone for good. The Labor Department’s report of new jobless claims, released Thursday, brought the total to 38.6 million since mid-March, when the coronavirus outbreak forced widespread shutdowns. While workers and their employers have expressed optimism that most of the joblessness will be temporary, many who are studying the pandemic’s impact are increasingly worried about the employment situation. “I hate to say it, but this is going to take longer and look grimmer than we thought,” Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, said of the path to recovery. COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.

314,101,,"New Delhi: Later this week, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee will meet to provide its assessment of inflation in India and, accordingly, set the repo rate. At the meeting, they will consider various factors that threaten inflation. It was based on one of these factors—the increase in minimum support price (MSP) for crops—that the RBI had raised the repo rate earlier this year in August. However, a new study suggests that the RBI’s fears may have been overstated and the move could hurt farmers. In a paper published in the latest Economic and Political Weekly, S. Mohanakumar and Premkumar examine the relationship between the MSP (a guaranteed price provided by the government for farmer’s produce) and inflation. Analyzing data from 2005-06 to 2017-18, they find that there is no statistically significant relationship between MSP for major crops (wheat, rice and cotton) and inflation. They argue that the lack of relationship is partly because many farmers do not even sell their produce at MSP. They point to a NITI Aayog study which revealed that only 10% of India’s farmers are even aware of MSP before they sow their crops. Consequently, authors believe the RBI’s response to hike the repo rate was inappropriate and could backfire. Since farmers rely heavily on credit for their production, a rate hike which increases the cost of credit will increase the supply price of agricultural commodities, according to the authors.",only [NUM]% of farmers are even aware of MSP before they sow their crops.,10,10,TRUE

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombit proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.",the number of coronavirus cases in india breached the [NUM] mark.,"10,000","10,000",TRUE

Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregt women and the elderly.

According to ACI World estimates, Asia-Pacific is facing the highest impact, with passenger traffic volumes down by 24% for the first quarter of 2020, compared to the forecasted traffic levels without COVID-19. Within the Asia-Pacific region, mainland China, Hong Kong SAR and the Republic of Korea remain at the centre of the effects with sizable losses in traffic volumes.

352,122,,"NEW DELHI: As pangolins come under the scanner as potential intermediate hosts of the novel coronavirus transferred from bats to humans, Indian wildlife conservationists warn that the states of Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand are emerging as the hotspots for the poaching of the endangered scaly anteater mammal. A recent study, published in the journal Cell, had placed pangolins as a natural reservoir of coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2, the one behind the COVID-19 pandemic. Another recent study had identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 like viruses in Malayan pangolins smuggled into China to be sold in wet markets. In these markets, pangolins find demand both in food and traditional medicine, making them the most-commonly trafficked mammal. ""The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of novel coronaviruses and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission,"" said Ved Kumar, a former wildlife conservationist with Wildlife Institute of India (WII), and founder of Maaty Biodiversity Conservation & Societal Research Organization in Uttarakhand. Kumar told PTI that over the last decade, the demand for pangolin biological parts in China and other Southern Asian markets has increased due to their perceived medicinal properties, and value as a delicacy. ""So the poaching graph of this species continuously increases,"" he said. In their study, published in the journal Forensic Science International : Reports, Kumar and his team described the hotspots for pangolin trafficking in India. Based on their research, Kumar said between 2003 and 2014, states in Northeast India like Assam, Manipur, and Meghalaya were the hotspots for pangolin poaching in the country, adding that trafficking of the animals is also increasing in other places.",pangolins are a natural reservoir of coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV[NUM].,-2,-2,TRUE

As your parents turn 60, they enter a phase of their lives when they need to spend a stress-free life with no worries. Ageing parents require frequent visits to the doctor and at times require repeated hospitalisation. While covering your parents under your family health insurance policy is a great way to ensure they get the best treatment whenever required, have you ever thought that considering the age of your parents, whether your family health insurance policy is really enough?

With healthcare inflation rising, your family health insurance cover of Rs 8-10 lakh may not necessarily solve the purpose. Moreover, there is a great possibility that if anybody makes a claim in a given year, the sum insured may fall short to pay for the entire hospital bill if another claim is made within the same policy year. This scenario makes it very important to cover your parents under an individual health insurance policy as chances of your elderly parents making a claim are much higher which may leave very less sum insured for the other insured members. Also, if you choose to cover your elderly parents under your family floater health insurance policy, the premium would be significantly high. It is always better to cover your spouse and kids under one policy and your parents under a separate policy. This will not only help you to reduce the premium but will also help in enhancing the coverage as the sum insured will not be divided amongst many people.

As senior citizens are more prone to particular ailments, the insurers implement a mandatory waiting period on many such common illnesses. If you get your parents enrolled under an individual health cover before they turn 60, there will be no burden of co-payment clause for a lifetime and also the waiting period will be served within a specified time period.

While buying a health insurance cover for your parents, there are numerous things that you need to consider for a seamless experience. Most of the policies carry an entry age limitation and a policy seeker cannot buy a particular policy if the entry age is crossed. So before buying a policy, check the entry age.

373,128,"While the government is addressing the first-order impact on the poor affected by the COVID-19 lockdown, a lot more needs to be done to help businesses and avoid second-order impacts, according to Navneet Munot, Executive Director and Chief Investment Officer, SBI Mutual Fund. “Social agenda needs resources that can only be generated by reviving growth and expanding the pie. Versus most countries, we have been high on stringency of the lockdown and low on fiscal support,""Munot told Moneycontrol. “The economic fallout is real and a matter of concern though,” he added. He expressed concern that while the fiscal room may be limited, India must be cautious of the ""paradox of thrift"". Paradox of thrift means individuals try to save more during an economic recession, which essentially leads to a fall in aggregate demand and hence in economic growth. ""Given the environment, both corporate sector and households may remain thrifty and risk-averse, the onus is on government to lever up and spend. While direct support to poor was critical during the lockdown, as the economy opens fiscal multiplier should be the driving force in prioritizing expenditure,"" he said. Track this blog for highlights from second day of FM's press briefings

Infrastructure projects should be prioritised to create immediate employment. Fortunately, rural economy is in decent shape and must be shielded from supply chain disruptions as well as from the virus that returning migrant workers may bring along, Munot said.","RBI's role

Munot agreed that the central bank has been aggressive in policy response so far, but yet it has only met with partial success in achieving the desired outcomes. He referred to the big disconnect between macro and micro level liquidity. The tepid response to TLTRO 2.0 suggests lack of risk appetite and therefore the real economy stays starved for funds, Munot said. Government providing first loss guarantee, further relaxation in prudential norms, and RBI capping absorption through the reverse repo window along with aggressive OMOs are some measures that should help transmission, Munot said. Referring to the credit market, Munot said: ""This month credit markets witnessed an unprecedented event when a $ 3 billion bond portfolio was left wanting for liquidity in a $ 3 trillion economy. ""

Next generation ficial system reforms such as deepening of corporate bond markets, securitisation market, channelising patient capital through the AIF route and creating lenders of last resort, to name a few should be considered, he pointed out. ""Banks' lending behaviour is largely pro-cyclical and therefore we need a strong institutional framework to facilitate access to capital across the credit spectrum when the cycle is at its worst and its need to sustain the economy is the highest. If access to formal capital stays blocked, there is a risk of return to informal money lenders and in turn reverse the gains of formalisation. Amidst the recent challenges in the debt market, SBI MF's conservatism and prudent credit assessment has helped.

US crude crashed to below $15 a barrel on Monday, its lowest level for over two decades, as concerns about a virus-triggered demand shock and lack of storage eclipsed an output cut deal. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the US benchmark, fell more than 19 per cent to $14.73 a barrel in early Asian trade before markets steadied and it clawed back some ground to $15.78 a barrel. International benchmark Brent dropped 4.1 per cent to $26.93 a barrel, before rising and stabilising at $28.11. Oil markets have plunged in recent weeks as lockdowns and travel restrictions to fight the coronavirus around the world batter demand for the commodity. The crisis was compounded after Saudi Arabia, the kingpin of exporting group OPEC, launched a price war with non-OPEC member Russia. Riyadh and Moscow drew a line under their dispute earlier this month when they and other countries agreed to cut output by almost 10 million barrels a day to boost virus-hit markets. But prices have continued to fall heavily, with analysts saying the cuts will not be enough to make up for massive falls in demand caused by the pandemic. WTI was hit particularly hard on Monday as analysts said there were concerns that its main storage facilities in the United States were filling up.

Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist with CMC Markets, said the plunge in WTI ""reflects a glut"" at the US facility in Cushing, Oklahoma. The benchmark has now ""decoupled"" from Brent ""with the spread between the two reaching a decade high"", he said in a note. ANZ added in a note that ""crude oil prices remained under pressure, as projections of weaker demand weigh on sentiment"".","""Despite the OPEC+ alliance agreeing to an unprecedented cut in output, the physical market is awash with oil,"" it said, referring to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC partners.

The downgrade in outlook comes as parts of China and Hong Kong remain under lockdown due to the deadly virus outbreak.

The broader market remains in deep distress — nearly 1,300 stocks have hit 52-week lows after the Budget announcement, exacerbating the six-quarter bearish trend. The benchmark Nifty has lost more than 5% since July 5. The sharp and prolonged slowdown in the economy and poor corporate earnings have prompted investors to pare their portfolios. Credit strategists Suisse said cuts in earnings estimates have become much more broad-based in the last six months, with over 75% of the top 150 firms seeing cuts to FY20 estimates. “While the aggregate quantum of cuts in the last three months is relatively minor, we expect the pace of cuts to pick up during the 1Q earnings season,” they wrote. Consumption demand is weak as seen from the lack-lustre sales of cars and two-wheelers. The higher surcharge on income of high-income individuals, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said, may affect demand for high-end real estate as the additional annual tax outgo is quite substantial at about 25-50% of the annual EMI related to a high-end property. “A further slowdown in sales of residential property may increase the current cash flow problems of certain real estate developers and by extension, the beleaguered housing fice companies,” they cautioned.","On Tuesday, as many as 34 of the BSE-500 stocks slumped to 52-week low with nearly a third of them coming from auto and ficial sectors.

452,164,"Midcap and small cap stocks are a sell on rallies as their relative strength has been weakening in favor of large caps, Rohit Srivastava, Fund Manager – PMS, Sharekhan, said in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Ad.

Q) It has been a roller coaster ride for the bulls in the second week of January. The index rose to fresh record highs and rose 2 percent for the week ended January 19? Do you think the momentum will continue?

A) We witnessed massive writing by option sellers in the past week. Usually, that means the markets may hold their own until expiration. So, the momentum may continue till expiration due to the large buildup in Put options at most strike prices. However, expect profit booking to show up post-expiration.

Q) What should be the ideal strategy ahead of the Budget?

A) Markets always build up expectations from the budget on either economic or tax reform or measures to boost growth. Markets always over expect and therefore, one should not buy on the budget news.","Waiting for the market to discount the news and then acting is a better strategy. Typically, lighten up on positions before the budget and wait for a day after to resume one's actions.

Q) How is the market looking on the weekly as well as monthly charts?

A) Markets always pause after 5-6 weeks of rally. So, chances are that we will pause into the Budget. Since July, the Nifty has rallied for 5-weeks in a row and then corrected. It did so into the August top and the same pattern also repeated into the November top after a 5-week rally in the month of October. We are also in the 13th month of a rally, and 13 is a Fibonacci number, Fibonacci months are often followed by market turns as well. The right Choice of stocks/sectors has been important throughout the last year and will continue to be so. There are many underperforming stocks and sectors even in Midcaps.

His appeal comes after scores of Shiv Sena workers thrashed a man and tonsured his head in Wadala area for posting a controversial comment on Facebook against Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. “Calm, composed, aggressive about delivering promises and serving the people. Let’s win people. Trolls lose anyway,” Aaditya, who is the son of CM Uddhav, said on Tuesday. He represents the Worli seat in the Vidhan Sabha. Aaditya said he got to know of the untoward and angry reaction to a ‘nasty, low life troll’ who used uncivilized language against the CM’s effort to maintain religious harmony and remove fear from Maharashtra about the new citizenship law. He said the Shiv Sena workers should focus on silencing the chaos, divisions, fear, hate and keep people united. “Our answer is to create jobs and revive the economy,” he pointed out. “Law and order is a subject of police and shouldn’t be taken by anyone into his/her hands.","Answering trolls who are nasty, threatening and abusive should not be our job,” Aaditya added. The man, identified as Hiramani Tiwari, 30, was thrashed by Shiv Sena workers after he posted a derogatory comment directed at CM Uddhav for comparing the police action on Jamia Millia Islamia University students in Delhi protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act with the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Hiramani works for a pharmaceutical firm in Wadala. According to visuals aired by television channels, Tiwari on December 19 shared the post under the name Rahul Tiwari.

471,173,"Seeking urgent steps to safeguard investors’ interest due to Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund’s decision to shut down six debt schemes, stock brokers’ association ANMI has asked the government and capital markets regulator Sebi to appoint a high-powered committee to take over the management of the fund house and examine its investment decision. In a letter dated April 26 the Fice Ministry and Sebi, the Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI), which represents 900 stock brokers, has also requested for steps to safeguard further erosion of investor wealth and to inform the investors of these six schemes in a time-bound manner about modalities for them getting back their investments. Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund closed six of its debt funds on Thursday, citing redemption pressures and lack of liquidity in the bond markets. These schemes are Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund. The decision has led to concerns about the fate of investments and mutual fund industry body AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds in India) rushed in on Friday to assuage the same. In its letter dated April 26, ANMI said that closure of the six schemes by the fund house has sent shock waves to the entire mutual fund investing community. The association alleged that Franklin Templeton MF had heavily invested in low rated papers in the debt market and had also put money into several lesser known companies. “Based on portfolio details published by FTMF of these six funds as on March 31, 2020, it appears that the profile of some of the companies FTMF chose to invest and the terms of those invested is questionable. “When market slowdown gripped the economy, there was a substantial price erosion in low rated papers in the debt market, where FTMF had heavily invested forcing them to stop the redemption,” ANMI has alleged. Besides, substantial investment in low-rated papers, ANMI also alleged that the investment made by the fund house are in contravention to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) norms.","With regard to Franklin Ultra Short Term Bond Fund, ANMI alleged that 70 per cent fund corpus has been invested by Franklin Templeton MF in securities, which are maturing after 1 to 9 years (2021 onwards up to 2029). It further alleged that the investment pattern is completely in contravention with the Sebi norms, which mandate investment duration of 3-6 months for ultra short duration funds. “FTMF has taken long dated securities that normally have lesser liquidity compared with short dated securities. These long dated securities with substantial investment in low rated papers is the real cause of illiquidity that has caused closure of six funds of FTMF,” it alleged. ANMI has also accused the top management and trustees of Franklin Templeton MF of having remained “mute spectators of such blatant violation of Sebi regulations”. However, the fund house’s President Sanjay Sapre, in a note to investors on Monday, said these schemes followed a consistent investment strategy of investing in investment grade papers across the credit rating spectrum, that is to say, from AAA through to A rated papers. This strategy served the schemes and its investors well till recent times and the schemes were able to generate significant cash flows even during the last six months, which were more turbulent times for the credit markets, he said. On Friday also, ANMI had urged Fice Ministry and Sebi to take swift action for protecting the hard-earned savings of lakhs of investors who had invested in Franklin Templeton MF. Besides, it had suggested that an expert committee of mutual fund professionals should be formed to determine the precise problem in Franklin Templeton MF debt schemes.",alleged that [NUM] per cent fund corpus invested by fund house in securities.,70,70,TRUE

New Delhi: India has an unprecedented opportunity to establish itself as an alternative destination for mobile phone manufacturing and become an export hub as global giants look at de-risking manufacturing from China in the post-COVID-19 era, a strategy document by ICEA-EY said on Thursday. The document, which has been shared with government authorities, has outlined a three-phase ' Restart, Restore and Resurgence ' strategy to help India achieve exports of USD 100 billion in mobile phones and nearly US 40 billion in components by 2025.The document said India appears to have all necessary ingredients to encourage mobile manufacturing at scale and boost exports from the country but what appears to be missing is the policy support to attract lead firms, incentivise production and unveil measures that provide cost competitiveness to industry or help offset the disabilities suffered by Indian firms vis-a-vis Vietnam and China. It is estimated that India suffers from various disabilities like high cost of power, tax and ease of doing business. This renders India almost 10 per cent and 20 per cent less competitive than Vietnam and China, respectively. India must address these disability issues in the long run, it added. In the short run, the government should endeavour to offset these disabilities by providing incentives which are WTO-compliant, easy to implement and help India take off from the export runway, it said. India spent USD 18.7 billion on import of mobile phones and parts, compared to exports of USD 2.0 billion of mobile phones and parts. India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo lauded the government's push to mobile phone manufacturing through production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) and Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme.

501,185,"Ever wondered why your neighbourhood chicken shop does not have your favourite meat, or even if it does, is pricing it too high? Amit Saraogi, Managing Director of Kolkata-based Rs 550 crore Anmol Feeds Pvt Ltd, a feed supplier to the poultry industry, says it is the complete breakdown of India's chicken economy - hatcheries to feed suppliers to commercial farms to bulk suppliers to retailers - that has caused this crisis. The exemption it enjoys as part of the agriculture and allied sector has not helped either. The problem started with a rumour in February that the bird may spread cor0navirus. This hit demand during the month. By the time the lockdown was announced in March, ""the Indian poultry industry had suffered a Rs 15,000 crore loss as bulk suppliers abandoned the birds and farmers sold them for almost free,"" says Saraogi. The demand is limping back but there is another problem. There are few birds, which means less demand for poultry feed, but Saraogi is struggling to meet even this demand as operations of his raw material suppliers - solvent companies that produce maize gluten, rice bran oil, etc - have been hit. The reason: they are not getting their raw material as soybean harvest, operations of rice millers, etc, have been hit due to labour shortage, administrative restrictions and shortage of trucks and truck drivers. The cash flow situation in the poultry industry is so bad that Saraogi says ""it will take at least three months, after the lockdown gets over completely, for it to normalise"".","Not all industries that have been allowed to function during the lockdown are facing such a catastrophic situation, but on April 4, Pawan Kumar Agarwal, Secretary of the Consumer Affairs Department of the government of India, shared a suggestive list of 71 companies that deal in essential goods with chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories. The idea was to ensure that none of these companies faced any difficulty in resuming production and moving goods across the country. The list included 48 food and grocery companies like Adani Wilmar Ltd, Britannia India Ltd and Pepsico India, 17 organised retail chains like Reliance Fresh and Mother Dairy, and seven e-commerce firms, including Amazon, Flipkart and Swiggy. Despite the clear instructions, none of these players can claim seamless, full-fledged operations across India.

502,185,"Ever wondered why your neighbourhood chicken shop does not have your favourite meat, or even if it does, is pricing it too high? Amit Saraogi, Managing Director of Kolkata-based Rs 550 crore Anmol Feeds Pvt Ltd, a feed supplier to the poultry industry, says it is the complete breakdown of India's chicken economy - hatcheries to feed suppliers to commercial farms to bulk suppliers to retailers - that has caused this crisis. The exemption it enjoys as part of the agriculture and allied sector has not helped either. The problem started with a rumour in February that the bird may spread cor0navirus. This hit demand during the month. By the time the lockdown was announced in March, ""the Indian poultry industry had suffered a Rs 15,000 crore loss as bulk suppliers abandoned the birds and farmers sold them for almost free,"" says Saraogi. The demand is limping back but there is another problem. There are few birds, which means less demand for poultry feed, but Saraogi is struggling to meet even this demand as operations of his raw material suppliers - solvent companies that produce maize gluten, rice bran oil, etc - have been hit.

In its annual edition of Notorious Markets List for counterfeiting and piracy, the USTR said on Wednesday that Snapdeal is known as a place to purchase counterfeit watches and shoes. According to a November 2018 survey, 37 per cent of its customers reported that they had received a counterfeit product from Snapdeal, the USTR said. Responding to the USTR’s move, a Snapdeal spokesperson said: “The comments made in the report in respect of Snapdeal are factually incorrect in most aspects, are based on unverified inputs and are defamatory in nature. “The comments made in the report in respect of Snapdeal are factually incorrect in most aspects, are based on unverified inputs and are defamatory in nature,” the spokesperson said. Snapdeal along with four Indian shopping complexes have figured in the US’ 2020 edition of the Notorious Markets List. Other than Snapdeal, the four markets are Tank Road in Delhi, Heera Panna in Mumbai, Kidderpore in Kolkata and Millennium Centre in Aizawl. “In July 2019, Snapdeal’s founders were arrested for selling counterfeit products,” the USTR claimed. Right holders have also sued Snapdeal for selling counterfeit goods,” said the report. In a statement, the spokesperson of the online marketplace said that the company firmly disagrees with the findings of the report and specifically in its observations relating to Snapdeal.","The report also ignores the extensive and on-going efforts by various marketplaces to collaborate with brands towards the protection of intellectual property on online marketplaces, said the spokesperson. As India’s third-largest marketplace, Snapdeal operates a robust anti-counterfeit programme – Brand Shield – that enables easy reporting and takedown of listings of counterfeits and delisting of defaulting sellers, it asserted, adding that it has well-defined measures to verify the identity of sellers based on government registrations. Snapdeal works closely with global and leading Indian brands and with law enforcement authorities to provide information wherever required to support any effort to enforce the legal rights of the brand owners, the spokesperson said. According to the spokesperson, Snapdeal is also an active member of the International Trademark Association, a global alliance spanning 7200 members across 187 countries, including large brand owners, small and medium enterprises, government offices, non-profits, among others. In all, the US Trade Representatives’ (USTR) annual list has 38 online markets and 34 physical markets that are reported to engage in or facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. The report released by USTR seeks to cast aspersions on many of the world’s leading online marketplaces, including Amazon, Pinduoduo, Shopee, Snapdeal, Taobao, Tokopedia and many more, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson claimed that the USTR report is based on a limited understanding of the business models of online marketplaces and ignores the roles and responsibilities of intermediaries under the law in various jurisdictions with respect to each of the models.

Just when she thought she’d get out and socialize in an attempt to heal from her grief, the pandemic hit. COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombit proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.","What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregt women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely.

The Commerce Department is expected to estimate that the gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of the economy, shrank at an annual rate of 5% or more in the January-March quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop in GDP since the Great Recession, which ended in 2009. And it would be the first quarterly contraction in six years. And yet forecasters say that will be only a precursor of a far grimmer GDP report to come for the current April-June quarter, when business shutdowns and layoffs have struck with devastating force.

CMIE data shows that of the 12.2 crore people who lost jobs in April, 75 per cent were small traders and daily wage labourers. This reminds one of Charles Dickens' literary masterpiece Hard Times where he referred to factory workers not as individuals but 'Hands', reducing people to their value producing part. The government recently announced that it is working on an action plan to upskill and reskill workers once the lockdown is lifted. The rationale is to enable them to be gainfully employed and restart economic activity. But, one of the problems is 90% of India's workforce is employed in the informal sector where no efforts are made for skilling. ""When firms get work from informal workers, they remain as hired hands, as mazdoor and no effort is made for their skilling and training,"" says Ravi Venkatesan, Founder of coalition Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME).

The latest one on the block is to let big corporate/industrial houses run banks. Interestingly, this is the only ""reform"" which hasn't dropped out of the blue at nightly live-telecasts; it is a mere proposal at present, but with far reaching consequences if pursued. This proposal comes from the RBI's internal working group (IWG) report released on November 20, 2020 stating: ""large corporate/industrial houses may be allowed as promoters of banks"" and non-banking ficial companies (NBFCs or shadow banks) owned by corporate houses ""may be considered for conversion into banks"".

Also Read: Rebooting Economy 48: Do tax numbers show a healthier economy? Why economists opposing big industries running banks?

All of India's top economists with wide national and international exposures strongly oppose this reform proposal. Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and former Deputy Governor Viral Acharya, who should know better about banking, wrote an article ""Do we really need Indian corporations in banking?"" describing it as a ""bombshell"" and ""best left on the shelf"". They offered two arguments against it: (i) industrial houses will get fices from banks they run with no questions asked (even though not their own money but public deposits), that the history of such banks (connected or related-party lending) ""is invariably disastrous"" and (ii) it will ""exacerbate"" concentration of economic and political power, making India susceptible to ""authoritarian cronyism"". They flagged a third point though didn't list it: (iii) banks are rarely allowed to fail in India, as in the recent cases of Yes Bank and Lakshmi Vilas Bank, in which case public depositors and taxpayers will bear the burden of bailouts, NPA write-offs and remonetisation as and when these banks fail.","a series of economic ""reforms"" have been unleashed since [NUM] that defy economic logic.",2016,2016,TRUE

534,200,"As governments struggle to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, billions of people living in countries teetering on the brink of economic collapse are being further threatened by a looming debt crisis, according to a UN report. In its report, the UN-led Inter-Agency Task Force on Ficing for Development explores the steps that governments must take to avert debt overload and address the economic and ficial havoc caused by the pandemic. ""The global community was already falling behind in efforts to end poverty, take climate action and reduce inequalities,"" UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said. ""We have one chance to build back better together for people and for the planet. ""

With recommendations based on joint research and analysis from more than 60 UN agencies and international institutions, the 2020 Ficing for Sustainable Development Report outlines measures to address the impact of the unfolding global recession and ficial turmoil – particularly in the world's poorest countries. The COVID-19 crisis has shaken global ficial markets with heavy losses and intense volatility that has prompted investors to move around USD 90 billion out of emerging markets – the largest outflow ever recorded. Particularly alarming for many Least Developed Countries (LDCs) is the prospect of a new debt crisis. To mitigate this, 2020 Ficing for Sustainable Development calls, among other things, suspending debt payments from LDCs and other low-income countries; strengthening the global ficial safety net; and reversing the decline in official development assistance. “We are far from having a global package to help the developing world to create the conditions both to suppress the disease and to address the dramatic consequences in their populations,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said during the recent launch of his report on the Socioeconomic Impact of the COVID-19. “What is needed is a large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive multilateral response amounting to at least 10 per cent of global Gross Domestic Product,” he added.","Beyond the immediate crisis response, the coronavirus pandemic should prompt the implementation of long-overdue measures to reset the world on a sustainable development path and make the global economy more resilient to future shocks. To do this, the report recommends accelerating investment in resilient infrastructure; strengthening social protections; enhancing regulatory frameworks; and strengthen the international ficial safety net and framework for debt sustainability. While highlighting gaps, new challenges and risks, the current crisis also provides a timely example of the potential of digital technologies. As lockdowns and physical distancing have become the norm, digital communication tools have helped keep people connected and provided online platforms for children to continue their education. But many workers in the so-called “gig economy”, dominated by service sector start-ups, are poorly protected against income losses in a recession. 2020 Ficing for Sustainable Development addresses these gaps and other opportunities and challenges of digital fice. “Only a collective response, inspired by shared responsibility and solidarity, will suffice to address the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs and Chair of the Task Force that issued the report Liu Zhenmin said. “Governments, development partners, the private sector and other stakeholders must work together to combat COVID-19 and support every effort to address its social and economic impacts,” he said.",the report is based on research and analysis from more than [NUM] UN agencies and international institutions.,60,60,TRUE

The domestic equity market had a roller-coaster ride this week with the dollar and crude oil hitting higher levels and taking the market lower. However, when crude oil relented, the market bounced back immediately. The change from bearish to bullish sentiment overnight was a little surprising to all. SBI , the country’s biggest lender reported its second straight quarterly loss of Rs 7,718 crore on account of surging provisions for bad loans and erosion in profitability from its core lending and securities trade business. The bellwether of the Indian economy did not meet the Street expectations; but the stock bounced back post results. This shows there was huge pessimism among investors and traders and SBI bounce post earning suggests the worst may be over at least for the interim period. There is very little room left for the stock to go down further in the short term.

538,204,"India’s fiscal deficit in 2020-21 may shoot up to 6.2 per cent of the GDP from 3.5 per cent government estimate as a fallout of the Covid-19 economic stimulus package, Fitch Solutions said on Wednesday. With businesses disrupted due to the lockdown and its ripple effects, revenue will come under “heavy pressure” and may force the government to look towards additional borrowing and/or a higher central bank dividend to fund its expenditure, it said. “At Fitch Solutions, we are revising our forecast for India’s FY2020/21 (April-March) central government fiscal deficit to widen to 6.2 per cent of GDP, from 3.8 per cent of GDP previously (estimated by Fitch Solutions), which reflects our view that the government will miss its initial target of 3.5 per cent by a wider margin,” the agency said. Underpinning the revised forecast are weaker revenue collection as a result of a sharp virus-driven downturn in economic activity and higher expenditures aimed at softening Covid-19’s economic shock. Stating that weak economic activity will likely see revenue collection contract in 2020-21, Fitch Solutions said receipts may contract by 1 per cent from a growth of 11.8 per cent previously. “We have revised our FY2020/21 real GDP growth forecast to 4.6 per cent, from 5.4 per cent previously, to reflect our view for growth to weaken further from our estimate of 4.9 per cent in FY2019/20 due to both economic disruptions due to domestic movement restrictions and weak global demand,” it said. The government declared a 21-day nationwide lockdown beginning March 25. “The rushed implementation of the lockdown which gave its citizens only a few hours to prepare has reportedly caused many rural migrants in the cities to be left without food and shelter, prompting them to return to their villages, either on the last remaining carriers or on foot.” The mass migration of such workers raises a significant risk of a larger Covid-19 outbreak across the country, it said, adding the rural areas reportedly have fewer coronavirus cases versus the cities as of end-March and the perceived safety of the rural areas has given another reason for the migrant workers to return home. “As such, we see virus-led economic disruptions extending for several quarters, which will weigh heavily on personal and corporate income tax collections for the year,” it said.","At the same time, expenditures are expected to surge as the government responds to the Covid-19 crisis both on an economic and social front over 2020-21. “We forecast expenditures to rise by 22.2 per cent despite lower revenue collection,” it said. “Faced with a humanitarian crisis brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, we believe that the central government will have no choice but to increase their spending, over and above what they have planned for in 2020-21 Union Budget and the Rs 1.7 lakh crore (0.8 per cent of GDP) fiscal stimulus package it released on March 26.” The package included cash handouts, free food for the poor, medical insurance for medical staff, and a temporary regulatory amendment for employees of small companies to dip into their pension fund to fund their expenditures in the meantime. Fitch Solutions said the Rs 1.7 lakh crore fiscal stimulus is “inadequate to provide support the economy of India’s size amid a likely global recession”. “In contrast, countries such as Singapore and the US have already announced stimulus packages worth 11 per cent and 10 per cent of GDP, respectively, and still are prepared to do more if necessary,” it said. “As such, we expect additional stimulus packages to be announced by the Indian central government over the coming months, and have accordingly factored this into our deficit forecast revision.”",government's fiscal deficit in [NUM]-21 may shoot up to 6.2 per cent of GDP.,2020,2020,TRUE

In separate stark warnings, two major European leaders bluntly told their citizens that the world needs to adapt to living with the coronavirus and cannot wait to be saved by a vaccine. “We are confronting this risk, and we need to accept it, otherwise we would never be able to relaunch,” Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte said, acceding to a push by regional leaders to allow restaurants, bars and beach facilities to open Monday, weeks ahead of an earlier timetable. The warnings from Conte and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson came as governments worldwide and many U.S. states struggled with restarting economies blindsided by the pandemic. In the U.S., images of crowded bars, beaches and boardwalks suggested some weren’t heeding warnings to safely enjoy reopened spaces while limiting the risks of spreading infection.

A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic.

The researchers warned that states’ capital expenditure in FY21 might turn out to be half the budgeted level of Rs 8.8 lakh crore. They also noted that the Centre’s budgeted capex for the current fiscal year might be equivalent to its uncovered loss of Rs 4.36 lakh crore, implying a huge potential cut in its capex too.

Given that only 58% of the FY20 capex target of Rs 3.6 lakh crore was achieved in the first eleven months, these states must have witnessed huge capex slippage for the whole of the year.

557,212,,"The CPI(M) led LDF government in Kerala has lined up Rs 50,000 crore worth infrastructure work for the current fiscal to revive the economy, badly hit by demonetisation and implementation of GST, State Fice Minister T M Thomas Isaac said today. Of this amount, administrative sanction had already been accorded to works worth Rs 20,000 crore and approval for the remaining would also be given soon, he said. Stating that Kerala as well as the nation was in the grip of a fiscal crisis after the note ban and implementation of GST, Isaac claimed this state government initiative was one of the biggest packages ever announced in the country. He said the fiscal problem faced by the state would not affect the proposed investments. Isaac was replying to a calling attention in the assembly on the need to solve the fiscal crisis faced by many sectors in Kerala due to demonetisation and GST implementation. Rejecting the opposition UDF's charge that the state government has not taken any steps to rejuvenate the economy, he announced that Rs 50,000 crore worth infrastructure work had been lined up for this fiscal. ""Actual work for these projects will start this year itself"", he said, adding this would definitely give a fillip to the state's ficial status. Isaac said the setback the state had due to GST was expected to be over in the coming days. Demonetisation had badly affected the co-operative sector in the state, he said and alleged that the Centre attempted to 'destroy' the sector under the cover of the note ban. As LDF was committed to safeguard this sector, the process of setting up the Kerala Bank was on, he said.",the state government has lined up Rs [NUM] crore worth of infrastructure work.,"50,000","50,000",TRUE

559,214,,"While the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is beginning to impart momentum to the way industrial sickness is resolved without the assets in question losing much value, a scheme announced by the NDA government in September 2016 would have complemented this process by fast-tracking the closure of perennially sick central public sector enterprises (CPSEs). However, it has managed to complete the winding up of only two of the 19 sick CPSEs that have been approved for closure since it came to power in 2014. In the case of another about 10 such CPSEs recommended for closure by the Niti Aayog, the government is yet to take a call, while its ‘revival plan’ for the mammoth Air India, which is deep in the red, carries little conviction. The under-achievement in liquidating terminally sick CPSEs is being ascribed to stay orders put by courts (mostly on petitions filed by workers’ unions and banks), delays in disposal of lands and other immovable assets and non-payment of statutory dues like salaries and taxes.

While two relatively small companies — Indian Oil —CREDA Biofuels and CREDA-HPCL Biofuels — are the ones that completed the closure formalities, many large loss-making firms that are a drain on the exchequer, including Hindustan Photo Films, HMT Watches, Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals (IDPL) and Tungabhadra Steel Products, are still awaiting closure. The CPSE sickness has been a intractable issue for many years, with its deleterious impact on government fices and the erosion of capital assets created. There were 188 government companies and corporations with accumulated losses of Rs 1,23,194 crore as on March 31, 2017. Of these, the net worth of 71 companies had been completely eroded by their accumulated losses. In FY18, there were 71 loss-making CPSEs which posted combined losses of Rs 31,261 crore, up 14% y-o-y.

572,216,"Coronavirus infections are spiking in Japan and creating hot spots in India’s congested cities just as the US and some of the hardest-hit European countries are considering when to start easing restrictions that have helped curb their outbreaks of the disease. Japan reported more than 500 new cases for the first time Thursday, a worrisome rise since it has the world’s oldest population and COVID-19 can be especially serious in the elderly. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency, but not a lockdown, in Tokyo and six other prefectures earlier this week. Companies in the world’s third-largest economy have been slow to embrace working from home, and many commuters were on Tokyo’s streets as usual. India, whose 1.3 billion people are under a lockdown until next week, has sealed dozens of hot spots in and around the capital, and will supply residents with food and medicine while not allowing them to leave. The number of confirmed cases exceeds 5,000, with 166 deaths, according to India’s Health Ministry. Meanwhile, deaths, hospitalizations and new infections have been leveling off in places like Italy and Spain, which together have more than 30,000 deaths. Even New York has seen encouraging signs amid the gloom. At the same time, politicians and health officials warn that the crisis is far from over and a catastrophic second wave could hit if countries let down their guard too soon. We are flattening the curve because we are rigorous about social distancing, New York state Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.","But it’s not a time to be complacent. It’s not a time to do anything different than we’ve been doing. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has climbed to about 1.5 million worldwide, with nearly 90,000 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Impact on suppliers and dealers yet to be estimated, but likely to be even worse

Sale of passenger vehicles could decline by as much as 20-24 per cent in ficial year 2020-21 in the worst case scenario as a result of the impact of a long drawn out recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in India, calculations made by industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has revealed. These numbers are based on GDP growth in the country slowing down to less than 1 per cent in the fiscal. This decline would push industry volumes back by a decade to around 2.15 million units, a level last seen in FY11. This would be the second straight fiscal that vehicle sales would have tumbled in double digits. In FY20, sales declined by over 17 per cent to around 2.77 million units. SIAM simulated the number for two other scenarios projecting GDP growth at a more optimistic 4 and 3 per cent depending on the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the overall economy. In the most optimistic case of a 4 per cent GDP growth, vehicle sales would decline by 10-12 per cent while in case of a 3 per cent GDP growth, it would decline by 13-16 per cent. At the start of the year in January 2020, without the shadow of the pandemic, SIAM had internally projected a 2-4 per cent growth for the industry in fiscal 2021.

The other segments of the $120 billion industry are likely to fare even worse. In case of a less than 1 per cent GDP growth, the decline in commercial vehicle sales is projected at 32-25 per cent, two-wheelers at 27-30 per cent and three-wheelers at 28 per cent. Overall industry volumes would decline by over 20 per cent. In case of a 4 per cent GDP growth, the decline would be 17-20 per cent for commercial vehicles, 16-18 per cent for two-wheelers and 18 per cent for three-wheelers.

Ever since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) fired its ‘bazooka’ on March 27, the bond market has treaded an altogether reverse path. On the day, the benchmark 10-year bond yield responded, albeit lukewarmly, to the central bank’s 75 basis point policy rate cut with mere 20 basis point softening. That, no doubt, also included reaction to outright open market purchases the same day (Rs 150 billion). Since then, term premia have climbed steadily, with the benchmark yield back to pre-75 bps cut or the March 26 value in less than a week, (6.29 percent, April 3). Till date, the reference long yield has risen 5.4 percent on its lowest, 6.09 percent, base on the day of the monetary policy review. A longer view shows this tepid response to monetary policy cues is not new, for the sovereign long bond yield has lowered about 100 basis points in response to the cumulative 210 basis points of policy rate easing over a year. The rising risk premia reflect the spiralling of fiscal risks due to the COVID-19 shock. Markets now anticipate a larger fiscal deficit — from the extra-expenditures on health and provision of economic support as well as the revenue losses from the stoppage of economic activities.

Ever since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) fired its ‘bazooka’ on March 27, the bond market has treaded an altogether reverse path. On the day, the benchmark 10-year bond yield responded, albeit lukewarmly, to the central bank’s 75 basis point policy rate cut with mere 20 basis point softening. That, no doubt, also included reaction to outright open market purchases the same day (Rs 150 billion). Since then, term premia have climbed steadily, with the benchmark yield back to pre-75 bps cut or the March 26 value in less than a week, (6.29 percent, April 3). Till date, the reference long yield has risen 5.4 percent on its lowest, 6.09 percent, base on the day of the monetary policy review. A longer view shows this tepid response to monetary policy cues is not new, for the sovereign long bond yield has lowered about 100 basis points in response to the cumulative 210 basis points of policy rate easing over a year. The rising risk premia reflect the spiralling of fiscal risks due to the COVID-19 shock.

It gives Hong Kong its own legal system and Western-style freedoms until 2047. But many fear those are being chipped away after authorities clamped down on massive pro-democracy protests that rocked the city last year.

614,226,,"Earlier this month, Apple made a rather unusual move by cutting its quarterly sales forecast — a first in over 15 years — citing slow iPhone sales in China. India, too, is becoming a difficult market for the technology major to crack. There was a 30-35% decline in Apple’s shipments in India last year on an annualised basis, after it revamped its distribution strategy, and cut down on discounting and differential pricing across channels. “Till the first half of 2017, Apple was trying to chase volumes with discounted prices, and driving affordability with the older models. In fact, at one point, Apple was selling iPhones for as low as `20,000-25,000,” notes Navkendar Singh, associate research director, client devices and IPDS, IDC India. The company has now consciously decided to go for value over volumes, to avoid the old lower-priced iPhone models from affecting the brand’s positioning. Higher pricing of new models in India — the iPhoneX costs around `1 lakh in India — the weakening rupee and high import duties have further added to Apple’s woes. Globally, however, pricing is not much of an issue and the market is driven by telcos, with Samsung selling at around the same price as Apple. Singh says what ails Apple in markets like China is its lack of innovation to excite consumers, vis-à-vis other players. One-upped by OnePlus

616,227,,"iPhone 12 Pro has been reimagined in the most unusual way possible. Caviar, the Russia-based smartphone designing company, has introduced the iPhone 12 Pro Stealth that comes with everything but the cameras. The company has covered the cameras on the back and disabled the one on the front of the iPhone 12 Pro to ensure foolproof privacy on the Apple device. Privacy is crucially important today, which is why companies offer their users several controls to manage it but one can never be sure enough. Having no cameras essentially gives you that sense. The chatter around user privacy has caused huge losses to big tech companies, after which they became extremely wary of including solutions to let their users manage privacy. Some of these solutions are camera shutters on laptops, microphone toggles on smart speakers, and tight permission settings on mobile operating systems (Android and iOS). But Caviar's iPhone 12 Pro Stealth goes beyond these measures and gets rid of all the cameras. The cameras are still there on the iPhone 12 Pro, they have just been covered with Caviar's premium, hardened titanium shield. There are two variants of the iPhone 12 Pro Stealth.",the iphone [NUM] Pro has no cameras and is a non-camera version.,12,12,TRUE
