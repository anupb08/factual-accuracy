The salt segment experienced a gross margin decline of $61.6 million due to lower sales volumes and increased costs, which partially offset the gains from the plant nutrition business. From 2015 to 2016, gross profit decreased by 9%, or $30.6 million, with gross margin dropping from 30% to 26%. The salt gross profit fell by $17.1 million, primarily due to reduced sales prices and higher production costs, despite lower logistics costs. In 2016-2017, selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose by $42.5 million, increasing the SG&A percentage of sales from 11.0% to 12.3%. Interest expenses increased by $18.8 million to $52.9 million, attributed to higher debt levels from the acquisition of Produquímica, although this was somewhat mitigated by lower interest rates from refinancing.

However, the company faces significant risks due to the uncertain global economic climate affecting the paper, steel, construction, and automotive industries, particularly in Europe."
"although these markets have stabilized , our global business could be adversely affected by further decreases in economic activity . our refractories segment primarily serves the steel industry . although north american production improved slightly in 2012 as compared with the prior year , we saw declines in european steel production and it remains below 2008 levels . in the paper industry , which is served by our paper pcc product line , 2012 production levels for printing and writing papers within north america and europe , our two largest markets were 5 % and 4 % below the prior year . in addition , our processed minerals and specialty pcc product lines are affected by the domestic building and construction markets and the automotive market . housing starts in 2012 averaged approximately 781 thousand units , and were up 28 % from 2011 levels . housing starts were at a peak rate of 2.1 million units in 2005 . · some of our customers may experience mill shutdowns due to further consolidations , or may face liquidity issues , or bankruptcy , which could deteriorate the aging of our accounts receivable , increase our bad debt exposure and possibly trigger impairment of assets or realignment of our businesses . · consolidations and rationalizations in the paper and steel industries concentrate purchasing power in the hands of fewer customers , increasing pricing pressure on suppliers such as us . · most of our paper pcc sales are subject to long-term contracts that may be terminated pursuant to their terms , or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us . · we are subject to volatility in pricing and supply availability of our key raw materials used in our paper pcc product line and refractory product line . · we continue to rely on china for a portion of our supply of magnesium oxide in the refractories segment , which may be subject to uncertainty in availability and cost .","our global business faces potential adverse effects from further decreases in economic activity, particularly in the steel and paper industries. The refractories segment, primarily serving the steel industry, saw slight improvements in North American production in 2012, while European steel production remained below 2008 levels. In the paper industry, production levels for printing and writing papers in North America and Europe were 5% and 4% lower than the previous year, respectively. Housing starts in 2012 averaged approximately 781,000 units, a 28% increase from 2011, but significantly lower than the peak of 2.1 million units in 2005. Additionally, customer consolidations may lead to mill shutdowns and increased bad debt exposure, while pricing pressures from fewer customers could impact profitability. Our paper PCC sales are largely governed by long-term contracts, which may be terminated or renewed under less favorable terms, and we remain vulnerable to volatility in raw material pricing and supply, particularly magnesium oxide sourced from China."

"critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate our revenue from three different types of contractual arrangements : cost-plus-fee contracts , fixed price contracts and cost reimbursable grants . costs consist primarily of actual internal labor charges and external subcontractor costs incurred plus an allocation of applied fringe benefits , overhead and general and administrative expenses as defined in the contract . revenues on cost-plus-fee contracts are recognized in an amount equal to the costs incurred during the period plus an estimate of the applicable fee earned . the estimate of the applicable fee earned is determined by reference to the contract : if the contract defines the fee in terms of risk-based milestones and specifies the fees to be earned upon the completion of each milestone , then the fee is recognized when the related milestones are earned under the “ milestone method of revenue recognition ” . otherwise , we compute fee income earned in a given period by using a proportional performance method based on costs incurred during the period as compared to total estimated project costs and application of the resulting fraction to the total project fee specified in the contract . under the milestone method of revenue recognition , substantive milestone payments , including milestone payments for fees , contained in research and development arrangements under our contracts with the u.s. government are recognized as revenue when : ( i ) the milestones are achieved ; ( ii ) no further performance obligations with respect to the milestone exist ; ( iii ) collection is reasonably assured ; and ( iv ) substantive effort was necessary to achieve the milestone . milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met : ( 1 ) it is commensurate with either our performance to meet the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item or items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone , ( 2 ) it relates solely to past performance , and ( 3 ) the value of the milestone is reasonable relative to all the deliverables and payment terms ( including other potential milestone consideration ) within the arrangement . if a milestone is deemed not to be substantive , the company recognizes the portion of the milestone payment as revenue that correlates to work already performed ; the remaining portion of the milestone payment is deferred and recognized as revenue as the company completes its performance obligations . for fixed price contracts with the u.s. government without substantive milestones as described above , revenue is recognized under the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for long term contracts . the percentage-of completion method recognizes income as the contract progresses ; recognition of revenue and profits generally related to the costs incurred in providing the services required under the contract . the use of the percentage-of completion method depends on the ability to make reasonable dependable estimates . the fact that circumstances may necessitate frequent revision of estimates does not indicate that the estimates are unreliable for the purpose for which they are used .","The company generates revenue from three types of contractual arrangements: cost-plus-fee contracts, fixed-price contracts, and cost-reimbursable grants. Revenue from cost-plus-fee contracts is recognized based on incurred costs plus an estimated fee, determined either through milestone recognition or a proportional performance method. Milestones are recognized as revenue when achieved, with conditions ensuring substantive effort and reasonable value. For fixed-price contracts without substantive milestones, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, which correlates income with the progress of the contract based on incurred costs. This method relies on the ability to make reliable estimates, and while circumstances may require frequent revisions, it does not imply unreliability in the estimates used for revenue recognition."
"estimating is an integral part of our business activities , and we may have to revise estimates on contracts continually as the work progresses . 39 we analyze each cost reimbursable grant to determine whether we should report such reimbursements as revenue or as an offset to our expenses incurred . in 2011 and 2010 , we recorded approximately $ 0.7 million and $ 2.9 million , respectively , of costs reimbursed by the government as an offset to research and development expenses . our revenue-generating contracts may include multiple elements , including one or more of up-front license fees , research payments , and milestone payments . in these situations , we allocate the total contract price to the multiple elements based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue for each element according to its characteristics . as revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the contracts , related amounts are recorded as unbilled accounts receivable , the primary component of “ other receivables ( including unbilled receivables ) ” in our consolidated balance sheets . as specific contract invoices are generated and sent to our customers , invoiced amounts are transferred out of unbilled accounts receivable and into billed accounts receivable . invoicing frequency and payment terms for cost-plus-fee contracts with our customers are defined within each contract , but are typically monthly invoicing with 30 to 60 day payment cycles . at december 31 , 2011 , unbilled accounts receivable were $ 3.0 million . research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred ; advance payments are deferred and expensed as performance occurs . research and development costs include salaries , facilities expense , overhead expenses , material and supplies , pre-clinical expense , clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing expenses , stock-based compensation expense , contract services and other outside services . share-based payments we have a long-term incentive plan ( the “ ltip ” ) under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to employees , consultants and directors at a price no less than the quoted market value on the date of grant .","Estimating is crucial in our business, requiring continuous revisions of contract estimates. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded approximately $0.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in government-reimbursed costs as offsets to research and development expenses. Our revenue-generating contracts often consist of multiple elements, such as up-front license fees, research payments, and milestone payments, with total contract prices allocated based on relative fair values. As of December 31, 2011, our unbilled accounts receivable stood at $3.0 million. Invoicing for cost-plus-fee contracts typically occurs monthly, with payment terms ranging from 30 to 60 days. Research and development expenses encompass various costs, including salaries, facilities, overhead, materials, clinical trials, and stock-based compensation.

General and administrative expenses decreased from $18.0 million in 2010 to approximately $14.3 million in 2011, largely due to a $3.0 million reduction in bad debt expenses and a $1.4 million insurance reimbursement, although there was an increase in non-cash stock compensation and other costs.

The purchase price is allocated based on fair value estimates derived from pre-acquisition due diligence and other sources. The fair value of tangible property is assessed as if vacant, using comparable sales data, while intangible assets are valued based on the present value of lease differences, considering risks and market rates. The company expenses transaction costs in the period incurred and amortizes capitalized lease intangibles over the remaining lease term."

These carrying costs are estimated for the lease-up period from vacancy to full occupancy. The assigned values for in-place leases and tenant relationships are amortized over the remaining lease term, and if a lease ends early, any unamortized costs are written off. The company also assesses potential impairments of identifiable, definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, including real estate, when indicators such as significant under-performance or changes in asset use arise. If impairment is determined, an impairment charge is recorded based on the estimated fair value of the property.

We utilize industry-standard actuarial methods to project ultimate losses, adjusting our IBNR reserves quarterly based on available information. Factors influencing our reserve evaluations include historical loss trends, claims frequency and severity, business mix, claims processing, legal developments, and economic conditions like inflation. Given the inherent uncertainties in these projections, the ultimate loss amounts may differ significantly from recorded reserves, and the impact of any single factor cannot be precisely isolated, necessitating a degree of judgment in our assessments."

The semiconductor industry is characterized by high volatility due to cyclical and seasonal dynamics, alongside macroeconomic influences. Historically, semiconductor consumption has shown long-term growth, driven by advancements in device performance and price declines from manufacturing improvements. Manufacturers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and outsourced assembly and test services (OSATs), often invest heavily in the latest capital equipment, leading to cycles of excess supply and reduced capital spending. Seasonal effects, linked to consumer purchasing patterns, typically see manufacturers ramping up capacity by the end of the September quarter, sometimes resulting in reductions in the December quarter. Macroeconomic factors also play a significant role, impacting demand for electronic devices and products with substantial electronic content, such as automobiles and telecommunications equipment."

The annual goodwill impairment test occurs in the fourth quarter, aligning with the completion of the annual forecasting process. The company continuously monitors for ""triggering"" events that could lower fair value, such as adverse changes in operating results or economic factors, which may lead to a non-cash impairment charge.

"see notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information . income tax accruals and valuation allowances . when preparing the consolidated financial statements , we are required to estimate the income tax obligations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate . this process involves estimating the actual current tax obligations based on expected income , statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions . in the event there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized in the results of operations , the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one-time item occurred . tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations . as a result , the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ( i.e . , our cash tax rate ) . some of these differences are permanent , such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return , and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time , such as depreciation expense on capital assets . these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities , which are included in our consolidated balance sheets . deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years , for which we have already recorded the expense in our consolidated statements of operations . we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income , and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely , we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets . deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return , but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations .","the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires estimating income tax obligations across various jurisdictions, taking into account expected income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities. This process includes calculating taxes for significant unusual or one-time items separately in the period they occur. The annual effective tax rate in the results of operations differs from the cash tax rate reported on tax returns due to timing differences in recognizing items, leading to permanent differences (e.g., non-deductible expenses) and temporary differences (e.g., depreciation). These differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets, which may be used as deductions or credits in future tax returns, require an assessment of their recoverability against future taxable income, necessitating a valuation allowance if recovery is deemed unlikely. Conversely, deferred tax liabilities arise from deductions taken in tax returns that have not yet been recognized as expenses in the financial statements."

An increase in expected volatility or life would elevate the fair value of stock options, leading to higher compensation charges, while a decrease would have the opposite effect. Forfeiture estimates for stock-based awards are based on historical pre-vesting experiences, with actual forfeitures impacting compensation expenses accordingly. Additionally, long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment, are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, with impairment charges recognized if carrying amounts exceed estimated undiscounted future cash flows.

Increased regulations on oil and natural gas producers, particularly concerning hydraulic fracturing, may diminish regional oil and gas supply, thereby affecting throughput on midstream holdings' gathering systems. Since 2011, operating margins have improved due to production growth, with significant contributions from midstream holdings' Cana, Bridgeport Rich, and Acacia systems, which experienced daily throughput growth of 83%, 6%, and 6%, respectively, from 2011 to 2013. This growth is attributed to the development of liquids-rich natural gas in the Cana-Woodford and Barnett shales, although overall growth has been constrained by throughput declines in other systems due to falling natural gas prices. Cost allocations for midstream holdings are influenced by Devon's centralized overhead and operating activities, with management asserting that their allocation methodologies are reasonable, though alternative methods could significantly impact profitability and financial condition."

This reserve estimation process involves significant judgment and can lead to varying estimates among different engineers, although historical experience suggests these differences are not materially significant."

The fair values of PP&E are determined based on estimated discounted future net cash flows, which are influenced by various inputs such as future throughput volumes, natural gas and NGL prices, operating costs, useful lives, and discount rates. While specific quantitative analyses of potential changes in these estimates are impractical due to their interrelated nature, it is noted that decreases in key inputs like throughput and commodity prices could lead to increased likelihood of PP&E impairment charges.

"midstream holdings tests goodwill annually in the fourth quarter of each year and more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of midstream holdings ' reporting unit below its carrying amount . because quoted market prices are not available for midstream holdings ' reporting unit , midstream holdings estimates its fair value using valuation analyses based on values of comparable companies and comparable transactions . in a comparable companies analysis , midstream holdings reviews the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly-traded midstream companies with comparable financial and operating characteristics . these characteristics are market capitalization , location of midstream operations and the characterization of such operations that are deemed to be similar to ours . in a comparable transactions analysis , midstream holdings reviews certain acquisition multiples for selected recent midstream company or asset package transactions . the fair value of midstream holdings ' reporting unit is then estimated by applying the average multiple determined from the two valuation techniques described above to current year projected cash flow . as these valuation multiples decrease , the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would decrease . as a result , the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge would increase . there are a number of inter-related inputs which can affect the valuation multiples . due to the number of inter-related inputs , it is impractical to provide specific quantitative analyses of potential changes in these estimates . however , general analyses can be provided for the most significant inputs which include current and projected throughput and current and projected natural gas and ngl prices . as such inputs decrease , the trading multiples will generally change in a like manner and would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge .","Midstream Holdings conducts annual goodwill tests in the fourth quarter and more frequently if events suggest a potential decline in fair value. Lacking quoted market prices, the company estimates fair value through analyses of comparable companies and transactions, focusing on factors like market capitalization, operational location, and similar characteristics. The fair value is derived by applying average multiples from these analyses to projected cash flows. A decrease in valuation multiples would lower the estimated fair value and heighten the risk of goodwill impairment. Key inputs influencing these multiples include current and projected throughput, as well as natural gas and NGL prices; declines in these inputs typically lead to reduced trading multiples and an increased likelihood of impairment charges."

"we expect 2014 natural gas liquids prices will be range-bound and remain relatively flat compared to 2013. crude oil prices remained relatively stable throughout 2013 , and oil continues to be more valuable than natural gas on a relative energy-equivalent basis . as a result , we and other producers have been focused on growing oil production . north american crude oil supply continues to increase due to the continued use of horizontal drilling technology throughout the u.s. and expansions of heavy oil production operations primarily in canada . global crude oil demand is expected to grow with supply in 2014. as crude oil supply grows , transportation capacity to downstream markets will be increasingly important . bottlenecks and other transportation limitations may continue to add volatility among u.s. and canadian grades of oil . however , we expect 2014 oil prices will remain relatively consistent with 2013. we exited 2013 with a production profile comprised of roughly 55 percent natural gas , 25 percent oil , and 20 percent natural gas liquids . recognizing the relative value of crude oil , we are devoting the vast majority of our 2014 capital investment toward growing our oil production , particularly the sweet grades of oil found in the u.s. to make a significant shift in our production profile , we expect to complete a $ 6 billion acquisition of eagle ford shale assets in the first quarter of 2014 and divest non-core , dry natural gas assets throughout 2014. once these transactions are complete , we expect oil will represent more than 30 percent of our production profile . further enhancing the value of our assets , we are combining substantially all of our u.s. midstream assets with crosstex energy , inc.

The North American crude oil supply is on the rise, driven by horizontal drilling in the U.S. and heavy oil production expansions in Canada. Global crude oil demand is projected to increase alongside supply, but transportation capacity will be crucial due to potential bottlenecks affecting U.S. and Canadian oil grades. As of the end of 2013, the production profile was approximately 55% natural gas, 25% oil, and 20% natural gas liquids. To shift this profile, a $6 billion acquisition of Eagle Ford Shale assets is planned for Q1 2014, alongside divesting non-core dry natural gas assets throughout the year, which is expected to elevate oil's share to over 30%. Additionally, a merger of U.S. midstream assets with Crosstex Energy is set to enhance asset value."

Notably, there are no contractual ""rating triggers"" that would accelerate debt maturities if ratings decline. However, a one-notch downgrade would raise borrowing costs under the senior credit facility from LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 125 basis points.

While demand for health, beauty, home care products, and commercial aircraft fastening remained strong, North American industrial-related product sales fell by nearly $20 million year-over-year. In the specialty products segment, industrial sales decreased by approximately $13.8 million, attributed to customer consolidation and reduced oilfield activity, while the packaging segment saw a decline of about $5.8 million due to lower demand. This decline significantly impacted operating profits, particularly in the specialty products segment, which experienced a 300 basis point drop in profit margins due to lower fixed cost absorption and increased conversion costs. Additionally, uncertainties surrounding tariffs and trade restrictions have affected demand, and a non-cash reduction of approximately $8.2 million in corporate expenses from 2018 did not recur in 2019.

Additionally, in 2018, the company incurred a one-time settlement charge of approximately $2.5 million due to the purchase of an annuity contract to transfer certain retiree defined benefit obligations to an insurance company. Key risks affecting the company's performance include the ability to generate organic growth through product development and cross-selling, as well as the successful acquisition and integration of companies to enhance product lines and distribution channels. The company does not experience significant seasonal fluctuations, except for the fourth quarter, which typically sees the lowest net sales due to holiday shutdowns and deferred capital spending.

"in mid 2018 , material costs began to rise , increasing through the remainder of 2018 , primarily as a direct and indirect result of foreign trade policy changes . these cost increases primarily related to oil and metal-based commodities . we took swift actions , and continue to take actions , to mitigate such cost impacts , including implementing commercial pricing adjustments , resourcing to alternate suppliers and insourcing of previously sourced products to better leverage our global manufacturing footprint . as a result of these actions , as well as softening of certain underlying commodity costs during 2019 , we largely mitigated the impact such that material costs were not a significant driver of year-over-year profit change . while higher material costs were not directly a significant driver of year-over-year profit change , certain of our packaging segment customers in the united states chose to resource their order requirements in 2019 to avoid tariffs or higher prices from tariffs , until , we believe , we are able to install capacity outside of countries subject to tariffs . story_separator_special_tag 35 year ended december 31 , 2018 compared with year ended december 31 , 2017 the principal factors impacting us during the year ended december 31 , 2018 compared with the year ended december 31 , 2017 were : increased sales levels across our end markets , primarily driven by higher demand for our industrial products within our specialty products reportable segment and from growth in our health , beauty and home care end market within our packaging reportable segment ; benefits of leveraging the tbm , as we continue to drive operating improvements , as well as evaluate , realign and streamline fixed costs and selling , general and administrative expenses ; the impact of the tax reform act , contributing to a lower overall effective tax rate ; higher commodity costs , primarily related to oil and steel-based raw materials , primarily impacting our packaging reportable segment ; the termination of the liability to metaldyne , resulting in an approximate $ 8.2 million reduction in selling , general and administrative expenses ; the impact of fees and expenses related to our issuance of our 4.875 % senior unsecured notes due october 2025 ( `` senior notes `` ) and other refinancing activities in 2017 ; and the settlement of defined benefit obligations in 2018 , wherein a one time settlement charge was recognized . overall , net sales increased approximately $ 48.9 million , or approximately 7.4 % , to $ 705.0 million in 2018 , as compared to $ 656.2 million in 2017 , as sales increased in all three reportable segments . the primary drivers of the sales increase were industrial cylinder products , as well as engines , compressors and related parts used in upstream oil and gas applications , which increased approximately $ 16.2 million and $ 7.4 million , respectively , within our specialty products reportable segment . in addition , sales of our health , beauty and home care products increased approximately $ 15.6 million within our packaging reportable segment . net sales also increased by approximately $ 1.7 million due to net favorable currency exchange , as our reported results in u.s. dollars were favorably impacted as a result of the weakening u.s. dollar relative to foreign currencies . gross profit margin ( gross profit as a percentage of sales ) approximated 28.4 % and 28.8 % in 2018 and 2017 , respectively . gross profit increased primarily as a result of higher sales levels , as well as lower facility exit costs within our packaging reportable segment .","In mid-2018, material costs began to rise due to changes in foreign trade policy, particularly affecting oil and metal-based commodities. Despite these increases, the company implemented strategies such as commercial pricing adjustments and sourcing from alternate suppliers, which helped mitigate the impact on profits. By 2019, softening commodity costs further alleviated pressure, and material costs did not significantly affect year-over-year profit changes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales increased by approximately $48.9 million, or 7.4%, reaching $705.0 million compared to $656.2 million in 2017, driven by higher demand in industrial products and health, beauty, and home care segments. Notably, sales of industrial cylinder products rose by $16.2 million, while health and beauty products increased by $15.6 million. The gross profit margin was approximately 28.4% in 2018, slightly down from 28.8% in 2017, with gross profit benefiting from higher sales and reduced facility exit costs."

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that influence reported tax-related assets, liabilities, and income tax expenses. These estimates are guided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) concerning uncertainty in income taxes. The company assesses previously unrecognized tax benefits based on three criteria: a likelihood of being sustained, effective settlement, or expiration of tax statutes. Additionally, the company recognizes that deferred tax assets can enhance tax benefits and net income. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances suggest potential impairment, with the impairment test involving a comparison of the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, against its fair value based on market capitalization."

In 2017, crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices were significantly higher than in 2016 and 2015, although still below the peak levels of 2014. U.S. exploration and production (E&P) companies demonstrated the ability to grow shale production at a crude oil price of $50 per barrel. Technological advancements have led to more efficient drilling and completion of non-conventional wells, resulting in higher returns on capital even at lower energy prices. Rig counts surged in the first half of 2017, leading to a shortage of completion equipment and crews, which caused the drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) count to increase by over 2,000 from December 2016 to December 2017, totaling nearly 7,500 wells. This indicates a significant potential volume that could be brought into production starting in 2018, with NGL volumes expected to grow faster than crude oil or natural gas volumes due to a shift in drilling focus."
"while changes in drilling rig counts ( as reported by baker hughes ) have historically been a reliable leading indicator of future production growth or decline , recent developments in technology , high grading of drilling locations and the large inventory of ducs have reduced the correlation between changes in rig counts and changes in production . we believe this to be especially true when comparing current rig counts to those prior to 2015. rig counts continue , however , to be a reliable indicator of overall e & p activity and investment . u.s. e & p company sentiment continued to improve in 2017 as the opec production freeze had a high level of compliance and storage levels indicated a return to global supply-demand balance . since may 2016 , total u.s. drilling rig counts have increased by 542 rigs , or 134 % , to 946 rigs as of february 2018. the crude oil rig count increased by 449 to 765 rigs , an increase of 142 % from the low in may 2016. likewise , the natural gas rig count increased by 100 rigs , or 123 % , from the low in august 2016. not all regions have reacted equally to the recovery in rig counts , with the largest increases seen in the permian basin and scoop/stack play in oklahoma . in the second half of 2017 , rig count growth stabilized , however , we believe the current rig count is enough to continue to grow production , even without completion of a significant number of ducs or further increases in productivity . permian outlook the permian basin in west texas and southeastern new mexico has experienced the largest increase in drilling activity in the country , with the number of active rigs increasing from 134 in april 2016 to 427 in february 2018. the permian basin is an oil prone basin with many attributes , including stacked pay zones , light sweet crude oil and a long history of support for the oil and gas industry . the current level of producer activity provides support for the construction of incremental midstream infrastructure in the basin .","As of February 2018, total U.S. drilling rig counts have risen by 542 rigs, or 134%, since May 2016, reaching 946 rigs, with the crude oil rig count increasing by 449 rigs (142%) to 765 and the natural gas rig count up by 100 rigs (123%) from its low in August 2016. The Permian Basin has seen the most significant growth, with active rigs increasing from 134 in April 2016 to 427 by February 2018.

Overall, U.S. exploration and production (E&P) company sentiment improved in 2017, aided by OPEC's production freeze compliance and a return to global supply-demand balance."
"an area of focus for us has been the development of midstream infrastructure serving producers in the delaware basin , which is part of the overall permian basin . the delaware basin historically has been a relatively lightly drilled area due to a lack of conventional targets . with the introduction of horizontal drilling and identification of stacked targets of tight-rock and shales , delaware basin drilling has accelerated over the past five years . these drilling targets have proven to produce not only light crude oil but also lighter and gassier hydrocarbons such as condensate and ngls . these gassier hydrocarbons have presented to us a large number of midstream opportunities to provide services to producers in the delaware basin . we are diligently working to identify attractive midstream prospects from these opportunities to complement our current asset infrastructure . during 2017 , we completed and placed into service two natural gas processing facilities ( south eddy and waha ) and are constructing three additional plants near orla , texas in the delaware basin . two of the orla plants ( orla i and ii ) are expected to start up in 2018 and one ( orla iii ) in 2019. when the orla plants are completed we will operate approximately 1.3 bcf/d of processing in the permian basin , which are all highly integrated with other enterprise natural gas and ngl assets , including our shin oak ngl pipeline that is currently under construction . in addition , we placed into limited service a major crude oil pipeline system , the midland-to-echo pipeline system that serves producers in the permian basin and originates at our midland , texas crude oil terminal and extends to our sealy , texas terminal and on to our echo terminal near houston , texas . we are also evaluating several other natural gas , ngl and crude oil projects in the permian basin . 70 eagle ford outlook rig counts in the eagle ford shale region were significantly impacted by the downturn in crude oil prices and producers allocating their capital budgets to other producing basins , especially the permian .","The focus has been on developing midstream infrastructure in the Delaware Basin, part of the Permian Basin, which has seen increased drilling activity over the past five years due to advancements in horizontal drilling and the discovery of stacked targets in tight-rock and shales. This area, previously lightly drilled, is now producing not only light crude oil but also lighter and gassier hydrocarbons like condensate and NGLs, creating numerous midstream opportunities. In 2017, two natural gas processing facilities, South Eddy and Waha, were completed, and three additional plants (Orla I, II, and III) are under construction, with expected startup dates in 2018 and 2019. Once operational, these plants will enable the processing of approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) in the Permian Basin, integrated with other assets, including the Shin Oak NGL pipeline. Additionally, a major crude oil pipeline system, the Midland-to-Echo pipeline, has been placed into limited service, extending from Midland, Texas, to Sealy and Echo terminals. The Eagle Ford shale region has seen a significant decline in rig counts, with 70 rigs impacted by the downturn in crude oil prices, leading producers to shift their capital budgets to the more productive Permian Basin."

The liability reflects SCC's estimates of future claims, although the company acknowledges that actual future claims and loss severity may vary significantly from historical data, making it difficult to predict potential losses beyond the current accrual."

This sensitivity analysis highlights the potential impact of changes in key assumptions on representations and warranties liability, although actual changes in one assumption may affect others in unpredictable ways. Since May 1, 2008, net losses on settled claims have remained within initial estimates, but future losses could exceed current estimates if factors such as the volume and validity of claims or residential home prices deviate from expectations. SCC routinely evaluates the likelihood of adverse legal outcomes and determines reserves for probable losses based on historical analysis. Reserves have been recorded for certain legal matters deemed likely to incur losses, while other matters are considered only reasonably possible or remote, resulting in no recorded liability. The assessment of potential litigation outcomes and associated losses is highly subjective."
"our judgments regarding likelihood of loss and our estimates of probable loss amounts may differ from actual results due to difficulties in predicting the outcome of jury trials , arbitration hearings , settlement discussions and related activity , predicting the outcome of class certification actions and various other uncertainties . due to the number of claims which are periodically asserted against us , and the magnitude of damages sought in those claims , actual losses in the future may significantly exceed our current estimates . see item 8 , note 19 to our consolidated financial statements . valuation of goodwill  the evaluation of goodwill for impairment is a critical accounting estimate due both to the magnitude of our goodwill balances , and the judgment involved in determining the fair value of our reporting units . goodwill balances totaled $ 846.2 million as of april 30 , 2011 and $ 840.4 million as of april 30 , 2010. we test goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change which would , more likely than not , reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value . our goodwill impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach and market comparables . this analysis , at the reporting unit level , requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense forecasts , anticipated changes in working capital and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate . changes in projections or assumptions could materially affect our estimate of reporting unit fair values . the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted","As of April 30, 2011, the company's goodwill balances were $846.2 million, slightly up from $840.4 million on April 30, 2010. The evaluation of goodwill for impairment is a critical accounting estimate due to the significant amount involved and the judgment required in determining the fair value of reporting units. The company conducts annual impairment tests, or more frequently if circumstances change, using a discounted cash flow approach and market comparables. This analysis necessitates considerable management judgment regarding revenue and expense forecasts, working capital changes, and discount rate selection.

This decline was primarily attributed to a $20.4 million increase in provision for credit losses, an $11.0 million (9.8%) rise in non-interest expenses, and a $2.1 million increase in preferred stock dividends. However, these were partially offset by a $10.9 million (8.6%) increase in net interest income and a $4.4 million (8.4%) rise in non-interest income. Total revenue for 2020 was $191.2 million, up $11.8 million (6.6%) from $179.4 million in 2019.

To prepare for client needs during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, liquid assets were intentionally increased, despite ongoing reductions in deposit costs and excess levels throughout the year. This led to marginally lower returns due to the interest rate environment. For the year ending December 31, 2020, non-interest income from investment management fees for Chartwell totaled $32.0 million, down from $36.4 million in 2019, despite an increase in assets under management to $10.26 billion, up $562.0 million from the previous year. Swap fees rose to $16.3 million in 2020 from $11.0 million in 2019, attributed to increased swap transactions.

This rise in rates was influenced by changes in the Federal Reserve's target federal funds rate, affecting variable-rate liabilities. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was mainly driven by a $514.3 million rise in average money market deposit accounts, a $445.1 million increase in average interest-bearing checking accounts, and a $299.5 million boost in average certificates of deposit."

For 2017, the company anticipates an increase in mailing and shipping revenue compared to 2016, although the growth rate is expected to be lower than the previous year due to the anniversary of the Endicia acquisition. Additionally, customized postage revenue is also expected to rise in 2017, but at a smaller percentage than in 2016, which benefited from a full year of Endicia results.

The company will continue to monitor customer metrics and economic conditions to adjust spending. Sales and marketing expenses are recognized in the period incurred, potentially leading to reduced operating profit and cash flow in future periods. Research and development expenses are expected to rise in 2017, but the percentage increase will be less than in 2016, with plans to hire additional personnel. General and administrative expenses are also projected to increase in 2017, with a similar hiring strategy.

The acquisition method of accounting is applied for business combinations, requiring assets and liabilities to be recorded at fair market values, with any excess purchase price recognized as goodwill. For acquisitions like PCD, Amega, and Bios, contingent consideration liabilities were recorded based on estimated future revenues, which are monitored for significant changes that could affect income or expenses."

Additionally, if contingent consideration from acquisitions varies from initial records, it could result in income or expense adjustments. Stock-based compensation is valued using the Black-Scholes model, which requires estimates of volatility and forfeiture rates, with expenses recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period. Contingent liabilities are accrued if it is probable that an asset is impaired or a liability incurred, and the loss amount is reasonably estimable; otherwise, contingencies are disclosed if there is a reasonable possibility of loss.

Profitability is influenced by several factors, including the volume of life insurance and annuity business in force, which is driven by sales levels and business persistency. The spread, defined as the excess of net investment income over interest credited, also plays a crucial role. The ability to price life insurance products effectively to achieve acceptable margins over benefit costs and administrative expenses is essential. Competitive conditions, mortality experience, persistency, benefit utilization, investment results, and expense management all affect product margins. The company can adjust credited interest rates, policyholder dividends, or cost of insurance charges to mitigate adverse experiences. Additionally, managing the investment portfolio for optimal returns while ensuring liquidity and minimizing default risks is vital. Operating expenses and changes in assumptions regarding surrender rates, mortality, and deferred acquisition costs also impact profitability, alongside changes in accounting guidance affecting profit recognition timing."

In 2017, the U.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.6%, while net farm income rose by 2.7% and farm real estate value increased by 3.3%, according to USDA estimates. Additionally, the U.S. 10-year treasury yield fell from 2.45% at the end of 2016 to 2.40% by the end of 2017.

Assumptions regarding future cash flows and growth rates are based on current and long-term business plans, with equity-based compensation expense amounting to 53."

In contrast, the fair value of option awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions about variables such as expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend rate, and service period. Additionally, deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences arising from discrepancies between financial reporting and tax reporting."

The assessment of collectibility is based on factors such as payment history, tenant financial strength, collateral value, and economic conditions. The company employs an aged bucket method for estimating allowances and adjusts reserves based on changes in assumptions regarding future rent payments. Additionally, the company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever circumstances suggest that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, determining recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flows. If an asset is deemed impaired, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, which is based on future discounted cash flows. The company has identified asset impairments in both 2016 and 2015, and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if necessary."

These cycles can be lengthy, leading to substantial design and development costs without guaranteed revenue. There are no long-term purchase commitments from customers, who order products on a purchase order basis. Once a product is integrated into a customer's design, it typically remains for the product's life cycle due to the high costs of redesigning. Product life cycles vary by application, with cable operator modems and gateways having cycles of 24 to 48 months, while industrial and wired/wireless infrastructure markets can extend from 24 to 60 months or more. Financial statements are prepared under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, requiring management to make critical estimates and judgments affecting assets, liabilities, and revenue recognition, particularly concerning inventory valuation, income taxes, and stock-based compensation."

The company primarily sells commercial off-the-shelf products, with revenue typically recognized upon delivery unless customer-specific acceptance criteria are present, in which case revenue is deferred until acceptance. For contracts with multiple elements, revenue is allocated based on the fair value of each element."

Revenue is recognized only after determining that collectability is reasonably assured, which involves evaluating customer creditworthiness. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to cover estimated losses from customer payment failures. Credit limits are set by reviewing each customer's financial history and stability, often supplemented by credit rating reports and financial statements. The collectability of trade receivables is regularly assessed, and if a customer's account becomes past due, communication is initiated to understand the situation.

"gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold , but could also include certain other period costs . gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues , but also reflects our cost-cutting programs and our ability to contain fixed costs . end-of-period backlog is one indicator of potential future sales . we include in our backlog only open orders that have been released by the customer for shipment in the next twelve months . if demand falls below customers ' forecasts , or if customers do not control their inventory effectively , they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog , in many instances without the payment of any penalty . therefore , the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods . another important indicator of demand in our industry is the book-to-bill ratio , which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period compared with the product that we ship during that period . a book-to-bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that demand is higher than current revenues and manufacturing capacities , and it indicates that we may generate increasing revenues - 27 - in future periods . conversely , a book-to-bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of lower demand compared to existing revenues and current capacities and may foretell declining sales . we focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory . we define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory ( computed using each quarter-end balance ) for this same period . a higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital .","Gross profit is calculated as net revenues minus the cost of products sold, potentially including certain other period costs, and is influenced by cost-cutting measures and fixed cost management. The end-of-period backlog, which consists of open orders scheduled for shipment within the next twelve months, serves as a potential sales indicator but may not accurately predict future results due to possible cancellations or rescheduling by customers without penalties. The book-to-bill ratio, which compares the amount of product ordered to the amount shipped, is crucial; a ratio above 1 suggests increasing future revenues, while a ratio below 1 indicates declining sales. Additionally, inventory turnover, defined as the cost of products sold over the past four fiscal quarters divided by average inventory, is a key metric for assessing inventory management efficiency, with higher turnover indicating better capital utilization."
"the quarter-to-quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business . the following table shows net revenues , gross profit margin , the end-of-period backlog , the book-to-bill ratio , and the inventory turnover for our business as a whole during the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of 2014 and through the fourth quarter of 2015 ( dollars in thousands ) : replace_table_token_7_th replace_table_token_8_th - 28 - net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 3 % from the net revenues reported in the third quarter of 2015 , and decreased 2.2 % from $ 60.2 million of net revenues for the comparable prior year period . higher net revenues in the force sensors and weighing and control systems segments were due to higher volumes in each segment , partially offset by a decrease in net revenues in our foil technology products segment , where we experienced lower volume . net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by the effect of foreign exchange rates of $ 3.6 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. exchange rates had minimal impact on net revenues from the third quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2015. the gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 1.2 % as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. higher gross profit margin in the weighing and control systems segment was partially offset by declines in the gross profit margins in the foil technology products and force sensors segments . the gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2015 decreased 2.3 % from the third quarter of 2015. higher gross profit margin in the weighing and control systems segment was offset by declines in the gross profit margins in the foil technology products and force sensors segments . story_separator_special_tag if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value , then we are required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment . to measure the amount of the impairment , we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired those reporting units . specifically , we must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets of that unit , including any unrecognized intangible assets , in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill .","In the financial analysis covering the five quarters from Q4 2014 to Q4 2015, net revenues for Q4 2015 reached $60.2 million, reflecting a 3% increase from Q3 2015 but a 2.2% decrease compared to Q4 2014. The increase in net revenues was driven by higher volumes in the force sensors and weighing and control systems segments, although this was partially offset by a decline in the foil technology products segment. Additionally, foreign exchange rates negatively impacted net revenues by $3.6 million compared to Q4 2014, with minimal effects noted between Q3 and Q4 2015. The gross profit margin for Q4 2015 improved by 1.2% year-over-year but decreased by 2.3% from Q3 2015, with variations across segments; the weighing and control systems segment saw higher margins, while the foil technology products and force sensors segments experienced declines."
"the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the book value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill computed in step two . the indefinite-lived trade names are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value based on current revenue projections of the related operations , under the relief from royalty method . any excess carrying value over the applicable fair value is recognized as impairment . any impairment would be recognized in the reporting period in which it has been identified . we estimate the fair value of our iprd asset using an income approach to valuation , whereby we estimate the future cash flows associated with the iprd and discount those cash flows back to their net present value using a discount rate determined using the capital asset pricing model , and adjusted for the forecast risk inherent in our projections of cash flows associated with this asset . our estimates of cash flows include revenues to be generated by the products supported by the iprd and the expected profits on those product sales . definite-lived assets , such as customer relationships , patents and acquired technology , non-competition agreements , and certain trade names are amortized on a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives . patents and acquired technology are being amortized over useful lives of seven to twenty years . customer relationships are being amortized over useful lives of five to eighteen years . trade names are being amortized over useful lives of seven to ten years . non-competition agreements are being amortized over periods of five to ten years . we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets .","Impairment loss is determined by the difference between the book value of goodwill and its implied fair value, calculated in a two-step process. Indefinite-lived trade names undergo impairment testing by comparing their carrying value to fair value based on current revenue projections, using the relief from royalty method, with any excess recognized as impairment in the reporting period identified. The fair value of the IPRD asset is estimated using an income approach, projecting future cash flows and discounting them to net present value with a capital asset pricing model-adjusted discount rate. Cash flow estimates include revenues and expected profits from products supported by the IPRD. Definite-lived assets, such as customer relationships (5-18 years), patents and acquired technology (7-20 years), trade names (7-10 years), and non-competition agreements (5-10 years), are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are continually evaluated for reasonableness."
"additionally , we review the carrying values of these assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition . - 32 - during 2015 and 2014 , we recognized impairment losses associated with the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from the kelk acquisition , which were recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. the impairments were driven principally by the impacts of excess steel manufacturing capacity , particularly in china , on our current and forecasted sales of product manufactured and sold by the reporting unit with the impairment losses . after considering the impact of the impairment charges , the carrying value of goodwill , indefinite-lived trade names , and iprd of this reporting unit as of december 31 , 2015 was $ 6.2 million , $ 1.0 million , and $ 0.1 million , respectively . the carrying values of goodwill , indefinite-lived trade names , and iprd of this reporting unit as of december 31 , 2014 were $ 12.8 million , $ 1.4 million , and $ 0.1 million , respectively . additional impairments could be recognized in the future to the extent that actual future operating results of the reporting unit are less favorable than those included in the forecasts used to derive our estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit , trade name , and iprd . we believe that our estimates of the future operating performance of the reporting unit are reasonable in the circumstances and were based on the best available information as of the dates of our impairment tests . impairment of long-lived assets we assess the impairment of our long-lived assets , other than goodwill and other intangible assets , including property and equipment , whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable . factors we consider important , which could trigger an impairment review , include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset , changes in historical or projected operating performance , and significant negative economic trends . pension and other postretirement benefits accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates . the discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans . other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels , estimated mortality , and for postretirement medical plans , increases or trends in health care costs .","the company has conducted impairment reviews of its assets, particularly focusing on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets from the Kelk acquisition, which resulted in impairment losses recognized in Q3 2015 and Q4 2014. The impairments were primarily influenced by excess steel manufacturing capacity in China, affecting sales forecasts. The carrying values as of December 31, 2015, were $6.2 million for goodwill, $1.0 million for indefinite-lived trade names, and $0.1 million for IPRD, down from $12.8 million, $1.4 million, and $0.1 million, respectively, in 2014. Future impairments may occur if actual operating results fall short of forecasts. Additionally, the company assesses long-lived asset impairments based on significant changes in asset use, operating performance, and economic trends.

"as such , we are investing a substantial amount to upgrade and replace systems and applications . during the past several years we have taken significant actions to improve the company 's risk profile , which include : ◦ the reduction of an above-average concentration in cre commitments , and within cre , the concentration of land development commitments declined from more than 70 % of total risk-based capital in 2007 , to less than 5 % at december 31 , 2017 ; ◦ numerous changes made to the credit administration organization and processes to facilitate improved data collection on loans and monitoring of potential default and loss risk ; ◦ the higher-risk portfolio of collateralized debt obligation securities were sold and replaced with government and government agency securities ; ◦ a significant increase in the on-balance sheet storehouse of liquidity with the purchase of moderate duration securities with limited duration extension risk ; i.e . , management has generally purchased securities that within the context of a rising interest rate environment would not experience interest rate related losses ; ◦ the addition of five members of the board of directors ; ◦ the replacement and upgrade of management information and accounting systems to allow for a more complete view of the company 's risks and opportunities ; ◦ the ongoing evaluation and classification of all known risks into approximately sixty unique risk categories , which are regularly monitored and reported in a process that flows from line-level employees through executive management to the board of directors ; ◦ the streamlining or elimination of redundant or inefficient processes , and the reduction of unnecessary complexity in product types ; with the improvement in the risk profile , along with improving profitability , the company 's capital stress test results have markedly improved within the past few years , and as such , we have increased the return of capital to shareholders including increasing the common dividend from $ 0.16 per share in 2014 to $ 0.44 per story_separator_special_tag although we consider a wide variety of sources when determining our fu nding needs , we benefit from access to deposits from a significant number of small to mid-sized business customers , which provide us with a low cost of funds and have a positive impact on our nim . including wholesale borrowings , the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 8 bps primarily due to borrowings increasing as a percentage of liabilities during 2017. the average balance of long-term debt decreased $ 286 million compared with 2016 , and although the average rate increased 61 bps in the current year , because remaining debt was at a higher average rate than the rate on debt that matured and was available to be called ; overall interest expense thereon decreased $ 13 million . as mentioned previously , the company has used short-term fhlb borrowings to fund some of its balance sheet growth . average short-term debt grew $ 3.6 billion and the rate paid increased 78 bps . further changes in short-term borrowings will be driven by balancing changes in deposits and loans as we do not foresee significant increases in investment security balances . the spread on average interest-bearing funds was 3.27 % and 3.23 % for 2017 and 2016 , respectively . the spread on average interest-bearing funds for these periods was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the nim . we expect the mix of interest-earning assets to continue to change over the next several quarters due to solid consumer loan growth , accompanied by moderate growth in cre term loans , and non-oil and gas-related commercial and industrial loans . we anticipate this growth will be partially offset by continued modest reduction in the nre portfolio . interest rate spreads and margin are impacted by the mix of assets we hold , the composition of our loan and securities portfolios and the type of funding used .","The company is making significant investments to upgrade systems and applications, having taken substantial actions to enhance its risk profile over the years. Notably, the concentration of land development commitments in commercial real estate (CRE) decreased from over 70% of total risk-based capital in 2007 to less than 5% by December 31, 2017. The organization has undergone numerous changes to improve credit administration, resulting in better data collection and monitoring of loan risks. The higher-risk collateralized debt obligation securities were sold, replaced by government securities, while liquidity on the balance sheet increased through the purchase of moderate duration securities. The board of directors expanded by five members, and management information systems were upgraded for better risk assessment. The company has classified known risks into approximately 60 categories, which are regularly monitored. As a result of these improvements, capital stress test results have significantly enhanced, leading to an increase in the common dividend from $0.16 per share in 2014 to $0.44. In 2017, the average balance of long-term debt decreased by $286 million, while the average rate increased by 61 basis points, resulting in a $13 million decrease in overall interest expense. Average short-term debt grew by $3.6 billion with an increase in the rate paid by 78 basis points. The spread on average interest-bearing funds was 3.27% in 2017, up from 3.23% in 2016, influenced by the mix of interest-earning assets, including solid consumer loan growth and moderate growth in CRE term loans."
"assuming no additional increases in the federal funds rate , we expect the yield on the securities portfolio to increase slightly , as the cash flow from the portfolio is redeployed into securities with yields that are slightly accretive to the overall portfolio . we expect the yield of the loan portfolio to increase somewhat due to the effects of rising interest rates in late 2017 , partially offset by a continued modest change in the mix of the portfolio ( increasing concentration in lower-yielding residential mortgages ) , as well as reduced income from higher-yielding loans purchased from the fdic in 2009 . 37 our estimates of the company 's interest rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both short-term and long-term interest rates , balance sheet composition , and other modeling assumptions , as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes . in addition , our modeled projections for noninterest-bearing demand deposits , which are a substantial portion of our deposit balances , are particularly reliant on assumptions for which there is little historical experience due to the prolonged period of very low interest rates . further detail on interest rate risk is discussed in “ interest rate and market risk management ” on page 68 . refer to the “ liquidity risk management ” section beginning on page 72 for more information on how we manage liquidity risk . net interest margin and interest rate spreads in 2016 vs. 2015 the nim was 3.37 % and 3.19 % for 2016 and 2015 , respectively . market trends and competitive pricing led to generally flat or lower yields across loans and investments in 2016 compared with 2015. these yield adjustments were offset by changes in the company 's asset mix , which in 2016 became less concentrated in lower-yielding money market investments , and more focused on higher-yielding agency securities and loans . further contributing to the improvement was a decline in the company 's cost of funds , due to higher amounts of noninterest-bearing deposits and tender offers , early calls and maturities of higher-rate debt , including the remaining trust preferred securities . average interest-earning assets increased $ 1.8 billion from 2015 , with rates improving 12 bps . average interest-bearing liabilities increased $ 769 million and rates decreased 11 bps over the same period .","it is anticipated that the yield on the securities portfolio will see a slight increase, driven by cash flow redeployment into slightly higher-yielding securities. The loan portfolio yield is also expected to rise, influenced by interest rate increases from late 2017, although this will be partially countered by a shift towards lower-yielding residential mortgages and reduced income from higher-yielding loans acquired from the FDIC in 2009. The company's interest rate risk estimates hinge on various assumptions regarding deposit and loan repricing, balance sheet composition, and competitive actions. In 2016, the net interest margin (NIM) improved to 3.37% from 3.19% in 2015, despite generally flat or lower yields across loans and investments due to market trends. This improvement was aided by a $1.8 billion increase in average interest-earning assets and a $769 million rise in average interest-bearing liabilities, with rates improving by 12 basis points and decreasing by 11 basis points, respectively."
"our average loan portfolio was $ 1.9 billion higher during 2016 , compared with 2015 , although the average interest rate earned on the loan portfolio was 8 bps lower than it was in 2015 due to competitive pricing pressure and depressed interest rates . the larger average loan base generated an additional $ 45 million of taxable-equivalent interest income during the year . the largest average growth in 2016 was in the cre portfolio , which also saw the average yield decline by 22 bps . the decline in loan yields occurred as new loans were originated or existing loans reset or were modified . see “ interest rate and market risk management ” on page 68 for further information regarding our interest rate sensitivity . during 2016 we continued to purchase u.s. agency pass-through securities in order to alter the mix of our interest-earning assets that began in the second half of 2014. the average balance of afs securities for 2016 increased by $ 4.4 billion or 84 % , compared with 2015 , and the average yield was flat at 1.93 % . average balances of money market investments over the same period declined $ 4.6 billion , with an average yield during 2016 of 0.59 % . this asset movement had the largest impact on the improvement in nim during 2016. average noninterest-bearing demand deposits provided us with low cost funding and comprised 44.4 % of average total deposits for 2016 , compared with 43.9 % for 2015. average interest-bearing deposit balances increased by 3","In 2016, the average loan portfolio increased by $1.9 billion compared to 2015, although the average interest rate earned on this portfolio decreased by 8 basis points (bps) due to competitive pricing and low interest rates. This larger loan base resulted in an additional $45 million in taxable-equivalent interest income. The commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio experienced the most significant growth, despite a 22 bps decline in average yield. The average balance of available-for-sale (AFS) securities rose by $4.4 billion (84%) from 2015, maintaining a flat average yield of 1.93%. Conversely, average money market investments fell by $4.6 billion, yielding 0.59%. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits accounted for 44.4% of average total deposits in 2016, up from 43.9% in 2015, while average interest-bearing deposit balances increased by 3%."
"study 404 also met its key secondary endpoint , clinical global impression scale for bipolar for severity of illness ( cgi-bp-s ) total score ( p < 0.001 ; effect size = 0.46 ) . study 401 tested two doses of lumateperone , 42 mg and 28mg along with placebo . in this trial , neither dose of lumateperone met the primary endpoint of statistical separation from placebo as measured by change 58 from baseline on the madrs total score . there was a high placebo response in this trial . lumateperone was generally well-tolerated in all three bipolar depression studies , with a favorable safety profile . in addition , while our phase 3 bipolar depression trials were powered for the overall patient population and not powered for subpopulation analyses , statistically significant benefit versus placebo was seen in the subgroup of patients with bipolar i and bipolar ii disorder in study 404 and in patients with bipolar i disorder in study 402 , but the bipolar ii subgroup was not statistically significant in study 402. in february 2021 , we submitted supplemental new drug applications , or sndas , to the fda for potential regulatory approval of lumateperone for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients with bipolar i or ii disorder as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy . assuming the snda submissions are accepted by the fda , we anticipate an fda target action date for the sndas in the second half of 2021. we are also pursuing clinical development of lumateperone for the treatment of additional cns diseases and disorders . at a dose of 42 mg , lumateperone has been shown effective in treating the symptoms associated with schizophrenia , and we believe lumateperone may represent a potential treatment for mood disorders including mdd , post-traumatic stress disorder and intermittent explosive disorder . we have commenced our program of lumateperone in mdd evaluating lumateperone as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of mdd and we expect to initiate clinical conduct in two phase 3 trials in 2021.","In the clinical studies for lumateperone, Study 404 achieved its key secondary endpoint with a significant improvement in the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolar Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-S) total score (p < 0.001; effect size = 0.46). Study 401, which tested lumateperone at doses of 42 mg and 28 mg against a placebo, did not meet its primary endpoint due to a high placebo response, as measured by the change from baseline on the MADRS total score. Lumateperone was generally well-tolerated across all three bipolar depression studies, showing a favorable safety profile. Statistically significant benefits versus placebo were observed in the bipolar I and II disorder subgroup in Study 404 and in the bipolar I disorder subgroup in Study 402, while the bipolar II subgroup in Study 402 did not show significance. In February 2021, supplemental new drug applications (SNDAs) were submitted to the FDA for lumateperone's approval for treating bipolar depression in patients with bipolar I or II disorder, with an anticipated FDA target action date in the second half of 2021.

Research and development expenses decreased to $65.8 million in 2020 from $89.1 million in 2019, a reduction of approximately $23.3 million or 26%. This decrease was largely due to a $15.1 million reduction in manufacturing expenses, as costs related to Caplyta were capitalized as inventory in the current year, alongside decreases in clinical expenses ($4.2 million), other project costs ($3.0 million), and share-based compensation ($1.0 million). Internal costs also fell by about $3.0 million due to lower labor, stock compensation, travel, and operating expenses.

For stock options granted in 2020, we have prioritized the historical volatility of our own stock price over that of a representative group of public companies for estimating expected volatility, and we will continue to do so until we gather sufficient historical data. We employ the simplified method outlined in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 for calculating the expected term of employee stock options, which averages the contractual term of ten years and a vesting term of four years, due to insufficient historical exercise data. This expected term is uniformly applied across the stock option grant group, as we anticipate similar exercise behavior among employees. For non-employee options, we base the expected term on the contractual arrangement. The risk-free interest rate is derived from a treasury instrument aligned with the expected term, and we assume a zero expected dividend yield, as we have never issued dividends and have no plans to do so."

Licensed from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in 2006, CDX-1401 is being developed for malignant melanoma and other solid tumors. A phase 1 study conducted in October 2012 enrolled 45 patients with advanced malignancies, 60% of whom had confirmed NY-ESO-1 expression. The study showed that 13 patients maintained stable disease for up to 13.4 months, with a median duration of 6.7 months, and treatment was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. Post-vaccination, 53% of evaluable patients exhibited increased NY-ESO-1-specific T cell responses, including both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses."

Revenue is derived from two main components: CFR (revenue excluding subcontractor costs) and reimbursable expenses. Direct expenses include the actual costs of professionals, primarily payroll and benefits, while paid time-off is categorized under selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A). The company also engages in fixed-price contracts and T&M contracts with caps. Subcontractors may be utilized, with their costs billed as both revenue and direct expenses.

While tire failures do occur, the majority are attributed to service-related issues beyond the company's control, such as improper maintenance and road hazards. The company accrues costs for product liability claims when a loss is probable and can be estimated, which requires specific information about the incident, the product's condition, and the extent of damages.

The costs associated with product liability claims have varied significantly, ranging from $0 to $33 million in one instance, with no meaningful average due to the unique and variable nature of these claims. No specific accrual is made for individual unasserted claims or premature claims lacking sufficient information for liability evaluation.

The primary goals of the organization are to enhance stockholder equity value and provide current income through real estate investments in senior housing and long-term care properties. The strategy involves investing in properties that offer potential for additional value and current returns while diversifying the investment portfolio by geographic location, operator, property type, and investment form. The organization focuses on skilled nursing properties that do not heavily depend on private-pay patients and prefers those with a strong market presence and regulatory barriers to competition. Additionally, investments in assisted living and independent living facilities are diversified, with a particular emphasis on memory care facilities that cater to seniors with Alzheimer's and dementia, providing specialized care in a more residential setting compared to traditional facilities."

Our investments in owned properties and mortgage loans are crucial for liquidity, reliant on operators' performance in meeting lease and loan obligations. Any operational difficulties faced by these operators could significantly impact our financial results and liquidity. To manage this risk, we conduct thorough monitoring, including financial statement reviews, operator credit assessments, property inspections, and covenant compliance checks. We also enhance payment security through credit guarantees and structured leases, such as master leases and cross-collateralized loans. Future investments in healthcare properties will be funded through cash reserves, temporary borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit line, and internal cash flows, which are generated from rent, interest receipts, and mortgage loan principal payments."

"see item 8. financial statementsnote 2. summary of significant accounting policies for a description of the significant accounting policies we followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . we have identified the following significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies in that they require significant judgment and estimates and have the most impact on financial reporting . impairments . impairment losses are recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset is impaired and the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount . management assesses the impairment of properties individually and impairment losses are calculated as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of assets to be 42 held and used , and carrying amount over the fair value less cost to sell in instances where management has determined that we will dispose of the property . in determining fair value , we use current appraisals or other third party opinions of value and other estimates of fair value such as estimated discounted future cash flows . also , we evaluate the carrying values of mortgage loans receivable on an individual basis . management periodically evaluates the realizability of future cash flows from the mortgage loan receivable when events or circumstances , such as the non-receipt of principal and interest payments and or significant deterioration of the financial condition of the borrower , indicate that the carrying amount of the mortgage loan receivable may not be recoverable . an impairment charge is recognized in current period earnings and is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan receivable and the discounted cash flows expected to be received , or if foreclosure is probable , the fair value of the collateral securing the mortgage . accounting standards codification no . 320 , investmentsdebt and equity securities ( or asc 320 ) , requires an entity to assess whether it intends to sell , or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell , a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis .","The consolidated financial statements prepared up to October 2023 follow significant accounting policies that require substantial judgment and estimates, particularly in the area of impairments. Impairment losses are recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from an asset fall below its carrying amount. Management assesses impairments on an individual property basis, calculating losses as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of assets held for use, or the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell for properties intended for disposal. Fair value is determined using current appraisals or third-party valuations, including estimated discounted future cash flows. Additionally, the realizability of mortgage loans receivable is evaluated individually, with impairment charges recognized when the carrying amount exceeds expected discounted cash flows or the fair value of collateral if foreclosure is likely. According to Accounting Standards Codification No. 320, entities must assess whether they intend to sell or are likely required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovering its amortized cost basis."
"if either of these criteria is met , the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as impairment through earnings . for securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria , the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows : 1 ) other-than-temporary impairment ( or otti ) related to other factors such as an entity 's ability to make scheduled interest or principal payments on the debt securities , which is recognized in other comprehensive income and 2 ) otti related to credit loss , which must be recognized in the income statement . the credit loss is determined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis . owned properties . we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component . in determining fair value , we use current appraisals or other third party opinions of value . the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to land and buildings and , for certain of our acquisitions , in-place leases and other intangible assets . in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles , the estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term . in the case of the value of in-place leases , the appraisers make best estimates based on the evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant 's lease . factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods , market conditions and costs to execute similar leases . these assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases . we evaluate each purchase transaction to determine whether the acquired assets meet the definition of a business .","impairment recognition for securities occurs when specific criteria are met, leading to the full difference between fair value and amortized cost being recognized in earnings. For securities that do not meet these criteria, impairment is divided into two components: other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) related to factors like the entity's ability to make scheduled payments, recognized in other comprehensive income, and OTTI related to credit loss, which is recorded in the income statement. The credit loss is calculated as the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost basis. In property acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated based on the fair value of components such as land, buildings, in-place leases, and intangible assets, which significantly influence depreciation and amortization over the asset's useful life. Appraisers consider various factors, including carrying costs and market conditions, to estimate the value of in-place leases, impacting future revenue recognition over the lease term. Each acquisition is evaluated to determine if the assets qualify as a business."
"transaction costs related to acquisitions that are not deemed to be businesses are included in the cost basis of the acquired assets , while transaction costs related to acquisitions that are deemed to be businesses are expensed as incurred . mortgage loans receivable . mortgage loans receivable we originate are recorded on an amortized cost basis . mortgage loans we acquire are recorded at fair value at the time of purchase net of any related premium or discount which is amortized as a yield adjustment to interest","Transaction costs for acquisitions not classified as businesses are included in the cost basis of the acquired assets, while those for acquisitions deemed to be businesses are expensed immediately.

The NY DFS also relaxed restrictions on Ocwen's ability to acquire mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), allowing for certain acquisitions under annual portfolio growth limitations until the successful migration of loans to the new system is confirmed. Ocwen aims to return to growth and profitability through several initiatives: integrating PHH's business, re-engineering its cost structure, fulfilling regulatory commitments, replenishing its servicing portfolio, and managing its balance sheet effectively.

Revenue from loan modifications fell to $59.4 million in 2018 from $97.2 million in 2017, while gains on loans held for sale decreased by $25.7 million, or 25%, due to reduced loan production, despite higher margins from a focus on the retail channel.

"in addition , msr valuation adjustments increased $ 25.7 million in 2018 due to the impact of higher runoff resulting from the acquisition of msrs from phh . fair value adjustments are largely offset by corresponding fair value adjustments related to the nrz financing liabilities , which are recorded in interest expense . excluding msr valuation adjustments , net , total expenses were $ 166.6 million , or 18 % , lower as compared to 2017 . total expenses for 2018 , excluding msr valuation adjustments , includes $ 59.2 million attributable to phh . story_separator_special_tag in the current market rate environment , we believe we have limited incremental fair value that can be realized even as interest rates increase absent comparable market transaction data supporting higher valuation multiples , which are already at historic highs . valuation is also impacted by loan delinquency rates whereby as delinquency rates decline , the value of the servicing portfolio rises . while we do not hedge changes in the fair value of our msrs , changes in fair value of any fair value elected msr financing liabilities , which are recorded in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations , will partially offset the changes in fair value of the related msrs . loan resolutions we have a strong track record of success as a leader in the servicing industry in foreclosure prevention and loss mitigation that helps homeowners stay in their homes and improves financial outcomes for mortgage loan investors . reducing delinquencies also enables us to recover advances and recognize additional ancillary income , such as late fees , which we do not recognize on delinquent loans until they are brought current . loan resolution activities address the pipeline of delinquent loans and generally lead to ( i ) modification of the loan terms , ( ii ) repayment plan alternatives , ( iii ) a discounted payoff of the loan ( e.g . , a “ short sale ” ) , or ( iv ) foreclosure or deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure and sale of the resulting reo . loan modifications must be made in accordance with the applicable servicing agreement as such agreements may require approvals or impose restrictions upon , or even forbid , loan modifications . to select an appropriate loan modification option for a borrower , we perform a structured analysis , using a proprietary model , of all options using information provided by the borrower as well as external data , including recent broker price opinions to value the mortgaged property .","In 2018, MSR (Mortgage Servicing Rights) valuation adjustments increased by $25.7 million due to higher runoff from acquiring MSRs from PHH. Total expenses, excluding MSR valuation adjustments, were $166.6 million, representing an 18% decrease compared to 2017, with $59.2 million of these expenses attributable to PHH. The current market environment suggests limited incremental fair value realization despite rising interest rates, as valuation multiples are already at historic highs. Loan delinquency rates significantly impact the servicing portfolio's value, with declining rates leading to increased portfolio value. The company has a strong track record in foreclosure prevention and loss mitigation, which aids homeowners and improves financial outcomes for mortgage investors. Loan resolution activities typically involve loan modifications, repayment plans, discounted payoffs, or foreclosures, and must comply with servicing agreements that may impose restrictions. A structured analysis using a proprietary model is employed to determine the best loan modification options based on borrower information and external data."

The company is obligated to advance funds for delinquent borrowers, which includes principal and interest (P&I) advances, taxes and insurance (T&I) advances, and various corporate advances for foreclosed properties. If P&I advances cannot be recovered from projected future cash flows, the company can cease these advances and declare excess advances as non-recoverable, allowing for immediate recovery from the trust's general collection accounts. Most advances have the highest reimbursement priority, meaning they are repaid from loan or REO liquidation proceeds before any interest or principal is paid on the bonds issued by the trust. Additionally, costs incurred from these obligations primarily consist of interest expenses related to financing the servicing advances, with many subservicing agreements allowing for quicker reimbursement of advances from the servicing rights owner."

Servicing fees are typically a percentage of UPB, while subservicing fees may be based on UPB or a per-loan basis. Operating efficiency is crucial, as the ability to process a high volume of transactions directly impacts servicing costs and overall operating results. Delinquencies adversely affect operations and cash flows, with non-performing loans being more expensive to service due to the need for loss mitigation activities, which require more skilled labor and incur higher compliance costs. Although some costs are offset by ancillary fees, severely delinquent loans lead to increased financial strain."

Initial data on safety and pharmacokinetics were expected in Q4 2020, with additional dose escalation and clinical activity data anticipated by mid-2021. Preclinical data presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC conference in October 2019 indicated that SY-5609 is a potent CDK7 inhibitor, showing over 13,000-fold selectivity for CDK7 compared to other cyclin-dependent kinases. It demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in models of ovarian and breast cancer, with sustained tumor regressions observed in triple-negative breast, small cell lung, and high-grade serous ovarian cancers. Enhanced responses were linked to RB pathway alterations, and the drug also showed anti-tumor activity in combination with fulvestrant in treatment-resistant estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer models. Additionally, SY-5609 exhibited greater tumor growth inhibition than SY-1365 in preclinical studies."

"the photomask industry has been , and is expected to continue to be , characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards . in order to remain competitive , the company will be required to continually anticipate , respond to , and utilize changing technologies . in particular , the company believes that , as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller , it will be required to manufacture even more complex optically-enhanced reticles , including optical proximity correction and phase-shift photomasks . additionally , demand for photomasks has been , and could in the future be , adversely affected by changes in semiconductor and high performance electronics fabrication methods that affect the type or quantity of photomasks used , such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field-programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application-specific ics . furthermore , increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks in the production of semiconductors . as of the end of fiscal 2013 , one alternative method , direct-write lithography , has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks , as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production , and the company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of this or other alternative semiconductor design methodologies . however , should direct-write or any other alternative method of transferring ic designs to semiconductor wafers without the use of photomasks achieve market acceptance , and the company does not anticipate , respond to , or utilize these or other changing technologies due to resource , technological or other constraints , its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected . both revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high-end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities , but generally command higher average selling prices ( `` asps `` ) . the company 's capital expenditure payments aggregated approximately $ 243 million for the three fiscal years ended november 3 , 2013 , which has significantly contributed to the company 's operating expenses . the company intends to continue to make the required investments to support the technological demands of its customers and position itself for future growth , and expects capital expenditure payments to be between $ 70 million and $ 90 million in fiscal 2014. the manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating ics and other related products built using comparable photomask-based process technologies has been , and continues to be , capital intensive . the company 's integrated global manufacturing network , which consists of eight manufacturing sites , and its employees represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base .","The photomask industry is undergoing significant technological changes and evolving standards, necessitating companies to adapt continuously. As semiconductor geometries shrink, there is an increasing need for complex optically-enhanced reticles, including optical proximity correction and phase-shift photomasks. Demand for photomasks may be negatively impacted by shifts in semiconductor fabrication methods, particularly as designs favor field-programmable gate arrays over application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). As of fiscal 2013, direct-write lithography has not proven commercially viable due to its slow speed for high-volume production, and the company has not faced significant revenue losses from alternative methodologies. However, if such alternatives gain acceptance and the company fails to adapt, it could face serious operational challenges. The company has seen both revenues and costs rise due to increased demand for high-end photomasks, which typically have higher average selling prices (ASPs). Over the three fiscal years ending November 3, 2013, capital expenditures totaled approximately $243 million, with expectations of $70 million to $90 million in fiscal 2014. The capital-intensive nature of photomask manufacturing is supported by an integrated global network of eight manufacturing sites, which constitutes a significant portion of fixed operating costs."

Our annual net dollar retention rate stands at 103% for the year ended December 31, 2014, indicating strong customer retention and potential for revenue growth. Additionally, our average annual revenue per launched customer increased by approximately 17% from 2013 to 2014. We calculate the annual net dollar retention rate by comparing the aggregate annualized subscription contract value of returning customers at the end of the year to the previous year, while the average annual revenue per launched customer is determined by dividing the annualized revenue by the average number of customers launched during the same period. Due to long-term contracts, we have limited renewal data, but our metrics suggest a stable revenue base and valuable customer relationships."
"our ability to convert backlog into revenue and improve our gross margin depends on how quickly we complete customer implementations . our implementation timelines vary from customer to customer based on the source and condition of the data we receive from third parties , the configurations that we agree to provide and the size of the customer . our implementation timelines for castlight medical are typically three to nine months after entering into an agreement with a customer . our implementation timelines for our other applications typically range from approximately six months to longer than twelve months . 35 professional services model . we believe our professional services capabilities support the adoption of our subscription offerings . as a result , our sales efforts have been focused primarily on our subscription offering , rather than the profitability of our professional services business . our professional services are generally priced on a fixed-fee basis and the costs incurred to complete these services , which consist mainly of personnel-related costs , have been greater than the amount charged to the customer . we also do not have standalone value for our implementation services for accounting purposes . accordingly , we recognize implementation services revenue in the same manner as the associated subscription revenue . prior to launching an individual customer , we incur significant costs associated with implementation activities , which we record as cost of revenue . since we do not recognize significant revenues from an individual customer until we launch , we generate a negative gross margin at the customer level during the implementation period .","the implementation timelines for Castlight Medical typically range from three to nine months post-agreement, while timelines for other applications can extend from approximately six months to over twelve months. The company's professional services, which are essential for supporting subscription offerings, are generally priced on a fixed-fee basis; however, the costs incurred, primarily personnel-related, often exceed the fees charged, leading to a negative gross margin during the implementation phase. This is compounded by the fact that implementation services do not hold standalone value for accounting purposes, resulting in revenue recognition aligned with subscription revenue. Consequently, significant costs are incurred prior to customer launch, recorded as cost of revenue, which further impacts profitability during the implementation period."
"seasonality . a significantly higher proportion of our customers enter into new subscription agreements with us or renew previous agreements in the third and fourth quarters of the year compared to the first and second quarters . this seasonality is related to the employee benefits cycle , as customers typically want to make our applications available at the beginning of a new benefits year , which generally occurs in the first quarter . this seasonality is not immediately apparent in our revenue because we do not begin recognizing revenue from new customer agreements until we have implemented our offering , based on the implementation timelines discussed above . therefore , revenue recognized in any quarter is primarily from customer agreements entered into in prior quarters . in addition , the mix of customers paying monthly , quarterly , or annually varies from quarter to quarter and impacts our deferred revenue balance . as a result of variability in our billing and implementation timelines , the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total value of our customer contracts , nor do changes in deferred revenue serve as a reliable indicator of our future subscription revenue . components of results of operations revenue we generate revenue from subscription fees from customers for access to selected applications in the castlight enterprise healthcare cloud including basic customer service support . we also earn revenue from professional services primarily related to the implementation of our offering , including extensive communications support to drive adoption by our customers ' employees and their families . we recognize subscription fees on a straight-line basis ratably over the contract term beginning when our applications are implemented and ready for launch , which is based on the implementation timelines discussed above . our customer agreements generally have a term of three years . we generally invoice our customers in advance on a monthly , quarterly or annual basis .","The company experiences significant seasonality in customer subscription agreements, with a notably higher proportion of new agreements and renewals occurring in the third and fourth quarters compared to the first and second quarters, driven by the employee benefits cycle. Customers typically aim to implement applications at the start of a new benefits year, which usually begins in the first quarter. However, revenue recognition from new agreements is delayed until implementation is complete, meaning that quarterly revenue primarily reflects agreements from previous quarters. The variability in customer billing—monthly, quarterly, or annually—also affects the deferred revenue balance, which does not accurately represent the total value of customer contracts or future subscription revenue. The company generates revenue from subscription fees for access to its healthcare cloud applications and from professional services related to implementation, with subscription fees recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, which is generally three years. Customers are typically invoiced in advance."
"amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue . amounts that have not been invoiced are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements . we generally invoice our implementation services upon contract signing on a fixed-fee basis , which is generally when we commence work . story_separator_special_tag revenue is recognized based on the terms in our customer contracts , which can provide for ( a ) a variable periodic fee based upon the actual or contractual number of users that is recognized to revenue based on the actual or contractual number of users or ( b ) a fixed fee that is recognized to revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement . certain of our cloud-based subscription arrangements include performance incentives that are generally based upon employee engagement . fees for performance incentives are considered contingent revenue , and are recognized over the remaining term of the related subscription arrangement commencing at the time they are earned . professional services revenue . professional services revenue is comprised of implementation services related to our cloud-based subscription service , as well as follow-on professional services to assist our customers in further adopting our cloud-based subscription service , and communications services . nearly all of our professional services contracts are sold on a fixed-fee basis . we do not have standalone value for our implementation services . accordingly , we recognize implementation services revenue in the same manner as the associated cloud-based subscription service , beginning on the launch date , provided all other criteria described above have been met . for follow-on professional services that are sold separately from the cloud-based subscription service , we recognize revenue as the services are delivered .","amounts invoiced are recorded as deferred revenue, while un-invoiced amounts are excluded from consolidated financial statements. Implementation services are typically invoiced upon contract signing on a fixed-fee basis, coinciding with the commencement of work. Revenue recognition is based on customer contract terms, which may involve a variable fee linked to the number of users or a fixed fee recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract's duration. Some cloud-based subscriptions include performance incentives tied to employee engagement, recognized as contingent revenue over the subscription term once earned. Professional services revenue, primarily from implementation and follow-on services related to cloud subscriptions, is mostly sold on a fixed-fee basis, with implementation revenue recognized similarly to the associated subscription service starting on the launch date, while follow-on services revenue is recognized as delivered."
"communication services revenue is recognized over the contractual term , generally one year , commencing when the revenue recognition criteria have been met . 43 multiple deliverable arrangements . to date , we have generated substantially all our revenue from multiple deliverable arrangements consisting of multi-year cloud-based subscription services and professional services , including implementation services and communication services . for arrangements with multiple deliverables , we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting . in order to treat deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting , the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery . if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery , we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered . if one or more of the deliverables do not have standalone value upon delivery , the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined with our cloud-based subscription service , and revenue for the combined unit is recognized over the remaining term of the cloud-based subscription service . our deliverables have standalone value if we or any other vendor sells a similar service separately . we have concluded that we have standalone value for our cloud-based subscription service as we sell these services separately through renewals and for our communication services as other vendors sell similar services separately . conversely , we have concluded that our implementation services do not have standalone value , as we and others do not yet sell these services separately . accordingly , we consider the separate units of accounting in our multiple deliverable arrangements to be the communication services and a combined deliverable comprised of cloud-based subscription services and implementation services . when multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting , the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price .","communication services revenue is recognized over a contractual term, typically one year, once revenue recognition criteria are met. The company primarily generates revenue from multiple deliverable arrangements, which include multi-year cloud-based subscription services and professional services, such as implementation and communication services. For these arrangements, the company assesses whether individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting based on their standalone value upon delivery. If deliverables have standalone value, they are accounted for separately; otherwise, they are combined with the cloud-based subscription service, with revenue recognized over its remaining term. The company has determined that its cloud-based subscription and communication services have standalone value, as they are sold separately, while implementation services do not, as they are not sold independently. Consequently, the identified separate units of accounting are the communication services and a combined deliverable of cloud-based subscription and implementation services, with arrangement consideration allocated based on relative selling prices."
"multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance provides a hierarchy to use when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting . vendor-specific objective evidence , or vsoe , of selling price , based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis , should be used if it exists . if vsoe of selling price is not available , third-party evidence , or tpe , of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists . if tpe does not exist , we estimate the best estimated selling price , or besp . vsoe does not currently exist for any of our deliverables . additionally , we do not believe tpe is a practical alternative due to differences in our cloud-based subscription service compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information for our cloud-based subscription service and our other services . accordingly , for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting , we allocate the arrangement fee to the separate units of accounting based on our besp . the amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenue , if any . we determine besp for our deliverables by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions . this includes evaluating our pricing practices , our list prices , the size of our transactions , historical sales and our go-to-market strategy . the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by management . for financial statement presentation purposes , we allocate the fees from our combined units of accounting to subscription and professional services based upon their relative selling price .","The accounting guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements establishes a hierarchy for determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price should be used if available; however, currently, VSOE does not exist for any of our deliverables. In the absence of VSOE, third-party evidence (TPE) is considered, but it is deemed impractical due to the unique nature of our cloud-based subscription service. Consequently, we rely on the best estimated selling price (BESP) to allocate the arrangement fee among separate units of accounting. This BESP is determined by analyzing pricing objectives, market conditions, historical sales, and transaction sizes, with management's consultation and approval. The allocation of fees from combined units of accounting to subscription and professional services is based on their relative selling prices, while the total arrangement fee allocation is constrained by any contingent revenue."
